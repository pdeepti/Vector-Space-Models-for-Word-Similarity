they aimed to show the world that post-war germany had nothing to do with the nazi germany of adolf hitler . but a week after the opening of the games , on september 5th , 1972 , members of the palestinian terrorist organisation black september broke into the olympic village , killed two israeli athletes , and took nine others hostage .
less than 24 hours later , the nine were dead , along with a german policeman and five of the eight kidnappers . afterward , many criticized the german government for bungling the rescue attempt . " certainly , the german handling was fairly inept , " said simon reeve , a british journalist who wrote a book on the incident , " one day in september , " which became the basis for an oscar-winning documentary .
" i don ’ t think anything else could have gone wrong , it was almost farcical in its nature .
the most obvious example is that there were only five snipers to tackle eight palestinians and rescue nine athletes and they did n't even have real equipment . " terrorism in its infancy german police captured three of the terrorists .
but in october 1972 , the men were released to libya after hijackers of a german plane demanded their liberation .
german authorities were also criticized for the release but reeve says it is important to remember that terrorism was in its infancy then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg says his film is intended to provoke meanwhile , the israeli secret service , mossad , launched a campaign to hunt down and assassinate those responsible for planning the israeli kidnappings - which is the main focus of stephen spielberg ’ s film , " munich . " in it , spielberg highlights the moral and psychological toll of the israeli reprisals . he also wanted with the film to reclaim the debate about the moral costs of the struggle against terror from " extremists " and engage moderate forces in the west and the middle east . " i wanted to use the medium of film to make the audience have a very intimate confrontation with a subject that they generally only know about in an abstract way , or only see in a one-sided way , " he told newsmagazine der spiegel . critics say film is not factual reeve , like many of the film ’ s critics , has problems with the way spielberg plays fast and loose with the facts , even though the film is billed as " inspired by real events " and does n't pretend to portray the incident with historical accuracy . " some are fabricated , some are factual , but there are no differentials , " he said .
" yet spielberg , because of his power , will come to define this event of enormous significance in european history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the film soft-pedals the incident others blasted " munich " saying the film equates the israeli assassins with the palestinian militants and tries to excuse the actions of the terrorists . spielberg dismissed the charges as " nonsense . " " these critics are acting as if we were all missing a moral compass , " he told der spiegel .
" of course , it is a horrible , abominable crime when people are taken hostage and killed like in munich .
but it does not excuse the act when you ask what the motives of the perpetrators were and show that they were also individuals with families and a history .
understanding does not mean forgiving .
understanding does not mean being soft , it is a courageous and strong stance .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

" for 2006 , we expect a significant decline of exports , " jochen clausnitzer , head of the dihk 's near and middle east department , told the reuters news agency . iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad has taken a defiant stance against the west since taking office , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and vowing to forge ahead with iran 's nuclear fuel program . ahmadinejad has been purging officials in state firms and ministries and replacing them with people who are expected to close fewer deals with german firms , clausnitzer said . " as a result , there will be very few orders won -lrb- by german companies -rrb- , " clausnitzer said . weapon development ? the west accuses iran of developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian energy program , a charge which iran vehemently denies .
western countries are now considering taking steps against iran that could lead to un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : persian carpets in a store in isfahan " given the current political situation , this business -lrb- iran -rrb- will be less and less interesting for german companies in the medium and long term , " clausnitzer said . iran has threatened to punish countries that back the us and eu drive to shut down its uranium enrichment program .
last year , diplomats and industry sources said tehran banned british and south korean imports in order to punish those countries . in 2004 , germany accounted for 12.8 percent of iranian imports , followed by france with 8.3 percent and italy with 7.7 percent .
other important exporters of goods to iran included china , united arab emirates , south korea and russia . export fears exports to iran from the 25 european union countries totalled 30.5 billion euros in 2004 , up from 17.7 billion in 2000 , according to eurostat , the eu statistics bureau . italy was europe 's top overall trading partner with tehran , with imports and exports adding up to 4.3 billion euros , according to italy 's institute for external trade .
oil provides the bulk of italy 's imports from iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machinery is a big eu export to iran european exports to iran are mostly transport equipment , machinery and chemical-related products .
after oil , iran 's main eu export is pistachios - 401 million euros worth in 2004 . germany , france and britain have been leading an eu effort to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program in exchange for economic and political incentives .
but iran has repeatedly rejected the offer , saying it will never give up its right to produce enriched-uranium fuel . now the eu-3 have joined washington in demanding that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- refer iran 's case to the un security council , which could impose economic sanctions . eu diplomats say italy and other eu exporters to iran like austria and portugal fear they , like germany , will be penalized by tehran and will not get contracts if they support referral of iran 's case to the security council .

" for 2006 , we expect a significant decline of exports , " jochen clausnitzer , head of the dihk 's near and middle east department , told the reuters news agency . iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad has taken a defiant stance against the west since taking office , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and vowing to forge ahead with iran 's nuclear fuel program . ahmadinejad has been purging officials in state firms and ministries and replacing them with people who are expected to close fewer deals with german firms , clausnitzer said . " as a result , there will be very few orders won -lrb- by german companies -rrb- , " clausnitzer said . weapon development ? the west accuses iran of developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian energy program , a charge which iran vehemently denies .

last year , diplomats and industry sources said tehran banned british and south korean imports in order to punish those countries . in 2004 , germany accounted for 12.8 percent of iranian imports , followed by france with 8.3 percent and italy with 7.7 percent .
other important exporters of goods to iran included china , united arab emirates , south korea and russia . export fears exports to iran from the 25 european union countries totalled 30.5 billion euros in 2004 , up from 17.7 billion in 2000 , according to eurostat , the eu statistics bureau . italy was europe 's top overall trading partner with tehran , with imports and exports adding up to 4.3 billion euros , according to italy 's institute for external trade .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .

" not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

" not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .
both cars and chemicals have seen continuous growth abroad since 1994 and the profits have boosted the bottom lines of german-based companies as a result . " i would say that foreign investments , on the whole , are a potentially positive step for german industry , " said professor christoph scherrer of the university of kassel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2006 questions arise about keeping employees safe abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult for some firms to assess the risk of sending employees to danger spots after the kidnapping in iraq of two german engineers employed by the firm cryotec , the company 's management has come under criticism .
it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad . " the firms often have special security departments that make assessments of the level of danger in a region to which employees might be sent , " he said . steffen leidel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians call hostages ' company to account for abduction the company that employs the two german engineers kidnapped in iraq was accused on thursday of failing to protect its staff by leading politicians who said it should pay part of the cost of finding them .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2006 hamas set for shocking win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official results are not out yet , but hamas has claimed victory exit polls indicate the militant hamas movement has claimed victory over the ruling fatah party in palestinian elections .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization .

they aimed to show the world that post-war germany had nothing to do with the nazi germany of adolf hitler . but a week after the opening of the games , on september 5th , 1972 , members of the palestinian terrorist organisation black september broke into the olympic village , killed two israeli athletes , and took nine others hostage .
less than 24 hours later , the nine were dead , along with a german policeman and five of the eight kidnappers . afterward , many criticized the german government for bungling the rescue attempt . " certainly , the german handling was fairly inept , " said simon reeve , a british journalist who wrote a book on the incident , " one day in september , " which became the basis for an oscar-winning documentary .
" i don ’ t think anything else could have gone wrong , it was almost farcical in its nature .
the most obvious example is that there were only five snipers to tackle eight palestinians and rescue nine athletes and they did n't even have real equipment . " terrorism in its infancy german police captured three of the terrorists .
but in october 1972 , the men were released to libya after hijackers of a german plane demanded their liberation .
german authorities were also criticized for the release but reeve says it is important to remember that terrorism was in its infancy then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg says his film is intended to provoke meanwhile , the israeli secret service , mossad , launched a campaign to hunt down and assassinate those responsible for planning the israeli kidnappings - which is the main focus of stephen spielberg ’ s film , " munich . " in it , spielberg highlights the moral and psychological toll of the israeli reprisals . he also wanted with the film to reclaim the debate about the moral costs of the struggle against terror from " extremists " and engage moderate forces in the west and the middle east . " i wanted to use the medium of film to make the audience have a very intimate confrontation with a subject that they generally only know about in an abstract way , or only see in a one-sided way , " he told newsmagazine der spiegel . critics say film is not factual reeve , like many of the film ’ s critics , has problems with the way spielberg plays fast and loose with the facts , even though the film is billed as " inspired by real events " and does n't pretend to portray the incident with historical accuracy . " some are fabricated , some are factual , but there are no differentials , " he said .
" yet spielberg , because of his power , will come to define this event of enormous significance in european history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the film soft-pedals the incident others blasted " munich " saying the film equates the israeli assassins with the palestinian militants and tries to excuse the actions of the terrorists . spielberg dismissed the charges as " nonsense . " " these critics are acting as if we were all missing a moral compass , " he told der spiegel .
" of course , it is a horrible , abominable crime when people are taken hostage and killed like in munich .
but it does not excuse the act when you ask what the motives of the perpetrators were and show that they were also individuals with families and a history .
understanding does not mean forgiving .
understanding does not mean being soft , it is a courageous and strong stance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2006 questions arise about keeping employees safe abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult for some firms to assess the risk of sending employees to danger spots after the kidnapping in iraq of two german engineers employed by the firm cryotec , the company 's management has come under criticism .
it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .
both cars and chemicals have seen continuous growth abroad since 1994 and the profits have boosted the bottom lines of german-based companies as a result . " i would say that foreign investments , on the whole , are a potentially positive step for german industry , " said professor christoph scherrer of the university of kassel .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one .

palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership .

originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .

" in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad .

there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping .

cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .

in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .

" our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

but that hamas would win an absolute majority and be in a position to form the government itself - that 's something that not even hamas members or those who voted for them would have thought possible . for the voters , the fatah leadership had come to a crossroads : they stood accused of corruption , but what 's more , failure in their attempts to reach a peace agreement with israel . hamas , on the other hand , was seen by voters as being incorruptible and ready to take action .
that hamas also stands for the complete rejection of israel and the peace process , and is responsible for a long series of terrorist attacks - that was a matter of only secondary or tertiary importance for voters . fatah leader mahmoud abbas put a brave face on the situation , letting it be known before the election that he could well imagine a coalition with hamas - on the condition that hamas accept his political course .
and that means , as in the past , negotiations and peace with israel . negotiating with israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas wave flags during a rally if hamas now forms a government , these plans will become obsolete , unless hamas itself comes to the understanding that there will be no progress in the israeli-palestinian conflict if the palestinians turn back to the hard , uncompromising lines of the pre-oslo accord days , denying israel 's right to exist and using violence and terrorism to achieve their goals . hamas did not make such strategies part of their election campaign , but they remain a permanent part of their program .
that 's why there are serious doubts about how , under these circumstances , there can possibly be a fresh start to peace efforts . creating headaches before the election , it was already clear , particularly in israel , that hamas ' taking a seat in the palestinian government would not only create headaches for the israelis , but also for the united states and the european union .
all of these governments have classified hamas as a terrorist organization until now , and in the first instance , it 's difficult to see how hamas can suddenly become acceptable in political circles . still , washington has hinted at how it could be done - you could continue to deal with the palestinian government , minus its hamas members .
it 's a solution that 's already been employed in lebanon , where cabinet members loyal to hezbollah are ostracized .

that hamas also stands for the complete rejection of israel and the peace process , and is responsible for a long series of terrorist attacks - that was a matter of only secondary or tertiary importance for voters . fatah leader mahmoud abbas put a brave face on the situation , letting it be known before the election that he could well imagine a coalition with hamas - on the condition that hamas accept his political course .
and that means , as in the past , negotiations and peace with israel . negotiating with israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas wave flags during a rally if hamas now forms a government , these plans will become obsolete , unless hamas itself comes to the understanding that there will be no progress in the israeli-palestinian conflict if the palestinians turn back to the hard , uncompromising lines of the pre-oslo accord days , denying israel 's right to exist and using violence and terrorism to achieve their goals . hamas did not make such strategies part of their election campaign , but they remain a permanent part of their program .
that 's why there are serious doubts about how , under these circumstances , there can possibly be a fresh start to peace efforts . creating headaches before the election , it was already clear , particularly in israel , that hamas ' taking a seat in the palestinian government would not only create headaches for the israelis , but also for the united states and the european union .
all of these governments have classified hamas as a terrorist organization until now , and in the first instance , it 's difficult to see how hamas can suddenly become acceptable in political circles . still , washington has hinted at how it could be done - you could continue to deal with the palestinian government , minus its hamas members .
it 's a solution that 's already been employed in lebanon , where cabinet members loyal to hezbollah are ostracized .
like hamas , hezbollah is commonly regarded as a terrorist organization in the west .
but this solution would no longer be an option if hamas is the ruling power in the palestinian government . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas set for shocking win exit polls indicate the militant hamas movement has claimed victory over the ruling fatah party in palestinian elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2006 hamas set for shocking win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official results are not out yet , but hamas has claimed victory exit polls indicate the militant hamas movement has claimed victory over the ruling fatah party in palestinian elections .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .
" and so you 're getting a sense of how i 'm going to deal with the hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian youths wear hamas head bands " countries in the region and the international community must respect our people 's choice , which is the result of democracy , " said hamas ' chief candidate , ismail haniya . palestinian leader mahmoud abbas also called on his people to recognize the vote as the voice of the people .

palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .
" and so you 're getting a sense of how i 'm going to deal with the hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian youths wear hamas head bands " countries in the region and the international community must respect our people 's choice , which is the result of democracy , " said hamas ' chief candidate , ismail haniya . palestinian leader mahmoud abbas also called on his people to recognize the vote as the voice of the people .
he said the palestinians had opened a new chapter in their troubled history and called for international assistance to revive the stalled peace talks . " we have embarked on a new era , and we need the international community 's help so that we can return to the negotiations on a final peace agreement with israel , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad .

there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .

one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope meets dissident theologian for talks the news that pope benedict xvi met over the weekend with the controversial swiss theologian hans küng , one of the most prominent critics of the roman catholic church , struck the vatican like a bolt from the blue .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2006 questions arise about keeping employees safe abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult for some firms to assess the risk of sending employees to danger spots after the kidnapping in iraq of two german engineers employed by the firm cryotec , the company 's management has come under criticism .
it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad . " the firms often have special security departments that make assessments of the level of danger in a region to which employees might be sent , " he said . steffen leidel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians call hostages ' company to account for abduction the company that employs the two german engineers kidnapped in iraq was accused on thursday of failing to protect its staff by leading politicians who said it should pay part of the cost of finding them .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad . " the firms often have special security departments that make assessments of the level of danger in a region to which employees might be sent , " he said . steffen leidel -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians call hostages ' company to account for abduction the company that employs the two german engineers kidnapped in iraq was accused on thursday of failing to protect its staff by leading politicians who said it should pay part of the cost of finding them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2006 study : moving production abroad can have positive effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german car industry is one which has profited from shifting production abroad the nightmare scenario of the german economy becoming one based on trade rather than production has some basis in fact .
but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .
both cars and chemicals have seen continuous growth abroad since 1994 and the profits have boosted the bottom lines of german-based companies as a result . " i would say that foreign investments , on the whole , are a potentially positive step for german industry , " said professor christoph scherrer of the university of kassel .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

" for 2006 , we expect a significant decline of exports , " jochen clausnitzer , head of the dihk 's near and middle east department , told the reuters news agency . iran 's hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad has taken a defiant stance against the west since taking office , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and vowing to forge ahead with iran 's nuclear fuel program . ahmadinejad has been purging officials in state firms and ministries and replacing them with people who are expected to close fewer deals with german firms , clausnitzer said . " as a result , there will be very few orders won -lrb- by german companies -rrb- , " clausnitzer said . weapon development ? the west accuses iran of developing nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian energy program , a charge which iran vehemently denies .
western countries are now considering taking steps against iran that could lead to un sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : persian carpets in a store in isfahan " given the current political situation , this business -lrb- iran -rrb- will be less and less interesting for german companies in the medium and long term , " clausnitzer said . iran has threatened to punish countries that back the us and eu drive to shut down its uranium enrichment program .
last year , diplomats and industry sources said tehran banned british and south korean imports in order to punish those countries . in 2004 , germany accounted for 12.8 percent of iranian imports , followed by france with 8.3 percent and italy with 7.7 percent .
other important exporters of goods to iran included china , united arab emirates , south korea and russia . export fears exports to iran from the 25 european union countries totalled 30.5 billion euros in 2004 , up from 17.7 billion in 2000 , according to eurostat , the eu statistics bureau . italy was europe 's top overall trading partner with tehran , with imports and exports adding up to 4.3 billion euros , according to italy 's institute for external trade .
oil provides the bulk of italy 's imports from iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : machinery is a big eu export to iran european exports to iran are mostly transport equipment , machinery and chemical-related products .
after oil , iran 's main eu export is pistachios - 401 million euros worth in 2004 . germany , france and britain have been leading an eu effort to persuade iran to give up its uranium enrichment program in exchange for economic and political incentives .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .

on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .
" and so you 're getting a sense of how i 'm going to deal with the hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian youths wear hamas head bands " countries in the region and the international community must respect our people 's choice , which is the result of democracy , " said hamas ' chief candidate , ismail haniya . palestinian leader mahmoud abbas also called on his people to recognize the vote as the voice of the people .
he said the palestinians had opened a new chapter in their troubled history and called for international assistance to revive the stalled peace talks . " we have embarked on a new era , and we need the international community 's help so that we can return to the negotiations on a final peace agreement with israel , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2006 study : moving production abroad can have positive effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german car industry is one which has profited from shifting production abroad the nightmare scenario of the german economy becoming one based on trade rather than production has some basis in fact .
but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .
both cars and chemicals have seen continuous growth abroad since 1994 and the profits have boosted the bottom lines of german-based companies as a result . " i would say that foreign investments , on the whole , are a potentially positive step for german industry , " said professor christoph scherrer of the university of kassel .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.01.2006 spielberg 's " munich " redraws line between fact and fiction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg 's political thriller relives 1972 hostage drama steven spielberg 's film about the aftermath of the murder of jewish athletes at the 1972 munich olympics opens in germany this week , taking a new perspective on the actions of the german and israeli governments . the subtext of the 1972 summer olympics in munich was the “ games of peace and joy . ”
they aimed to show the world that post-war germany had nothing to do with the nazi germany of adolf hitler . but a week after the opening of the games , on september 5th , 1972 , members of the palestinian terrorist organisation black september broke into the olympic village , killed two israeli athletes , and took nine others hostage .
less than 24 hours later , the nine were dead , along with a german policeman and five of the eight kidnappers . afterward , many criticized the german government for bungling the rescue attempt . " certainly , the german handling was fairly inept , " said simon reeve , a british journalist who wrote a book on the incident , " one day in september , " which became the basis for an oscar-winning documentary .
" i don ’ t think anything else could have gone wrong , it was almost farcical in its nature .
the most obvious example is that there were only five snipers to tackle eight palestinians and rescue nine athletes and they did n't even have real equipment . " terrorism in its infancy german police captured three of the terrorists .
but in october 1972 , the men were released to libya after hijackers of a german plane demanded their liberation .
german authorities were also criticized for the release but reeve says it is important to remember that terrorism was in its infancy then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg says his film is intended to provoke meanwhile , the israeli secret service , mossad , launched a campaign to hunt down and assassinate those responsible for planning the israeli kidnappings - which is the main focus of stephen spielberg ’ s film , " munich . " in it , spielberg highlights the moral and psychological toll of the israeli reprisals . he also wanted with the film to reclaim the debate about the moral costs of the struggle against terror from " extremists " and engage moderate forces in the west and the middle east . " i wanted to use the medium of film to make the audience have a very intimate confrontation with a subject that they generally only know about in an abstract way , or only see in a one-sided way , " he told newsmagazine der spiegel . critics say film is not factual reeve , like many of the film ’ s critics , has problems with the way spielberg plays fast and loose with the facts , even though the film is billed as " inspired by real events " and does n't pretend to portray the incident with historical accuracy . " some are fabricated , some are factual , but there are no differentials , " he said .
" yet spielberg , because of his power , will come to define this event of enormous significance in european history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the film soft-pedals the incident others blasted " munich " saying the film equates the israeli assassins with the palestinian militants and tries to excuse the actions of the terrorists . spielberg dismissed the charges as " nonsense .

they aimed to show the world that post-war germany had nothing to do with the nazi germany of adolf hitler . but a week after the opening of the games , on september 5th , 1972 , members of the palestinian terrorist organisation black september broke into the olympic village , killed two israeli athletes , and took nine others hostage .
less than 24 hours later , the nine were dead , along with a german policeman and five of the eight kidnappers . afterward , many criticized the german government for bungling the rescue attempt . " certainly , the german handling was fairly inept , " said simon reeve , a british journalist who wrote a book on the incident , " one day in september , " which became the basis for an oscar-winning documentary .
" i don ’ t think anything else could have gone wrong , it was almost farcical in its nature .
the most obvious example is that there were only five snipers to tackle eight palestinians and rescue nine athletes and they did n't even have real equipment . " terrorism in its infancy german police captured three of the terrorists .
but in october 1972 , the men were released to libya after hijackers of a german plane demanded their liberation .
german authorities were also criticized for the release but reeve says it is important to remember that terrorism was in its infancy then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg says his film is intended to provoke meanwhile , the israeli secret service , mossad , launched a campaign to hunt down and assassinate those responsible for planning the israeli kidnappings - which is the main focus of stephen spielberg ’ s film , " munich . " in it , spielberg highlights the moral and psychological toll of the israeli reprisals . he also wanted with the film to reclaim the debate about the moral costs of the struggle against terror from " extremists " and engage moderate forces in the west and the middle east . " i wanted to use the medium of film to make the audience have a very intimate confrontation with a subject that they generally only know about in an abstract way , or only see in a one-sided way , " he told newsmagazine der spiegel . critics say film is not factual reeve , like many of the film ’ s critics , has problems with the way spielberg plays fast and loose with the facts , even though the film is billed as " inspired by real events " and does n't pretend to portray the incident with historical accuracy . " some are fabricated , some are factual , but there are no differentials , " he said .
" yet spielberg , because of his power , will come to define this event of enormous significance in european history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the film soft-pedals the incident others blasted " munich " saying the film equates the israeli assassins with the palestinian militants and tries to excuse the actions of the terrorists . spielberg dismissed the charges as " nonsense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2006 hamas set for shocking win großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official results are not out yet , but hamas has claimed victory exit polls indicate the militant hamas movement has claimed victory over the ruling fatah party in palestinian elections .
palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .
" and so you 're getting a sense of how i 'm going to deal with the hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian youths wear hamas head bands " countries in the region and the international community must respect our people 's choice , which is the result of democracy , " said hamas ' chief candidate , ismail haniya . palestinian leader mahmoud abbas also called on his people to recognize the vote as the voice of the people .
he said the palestinians had opened a new chapter in their troubled history and called for international assistance to revive the stalled peace talks . " we have embarked on a new era , and we need the international community 's help so that we can return to the negotiations on a final peace agreement with israel , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .

but that hamas would win an absolute majority and be in a position to form the government itself - that 's something that not even hamas members or those who voted for them would have thought possible . for the voters , the fatah leadership had come to a crossroads : they stood accused of corruption , but what 's more , failure in their attempts to reach a peace agreement with israel . hamas , on the other hand , was seen by voters as being incorruptible and ready to take action .
that hamas also stands for the complete rejection of israel and the peace process , and is responsible for a long series of terrorist attacks - that was a matter of only secondary or tertiary importance for voters . fatah leader mahmoud abbas put a brave face on the situation , letting it be known before the election that he could well imagine a coalition with hamas - on the condition that hamas accept his political course .
and that means , as in the past , negotiations and peace with israel . negotiating with israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas wave flags during a rally if hamas now forms a government , these plans will become obsolete , unless hamas itself comes to the understanding that there will be no progress in the israeli-palestinian conflict if the palestinians turn back to the hard , uncompromising lines of the pre-oslo accord days , denying israel 's right to exist and using violence and terrorism to achieve their goals . hamas did not make such strategies part of their election campaign , but they remain a permanent part of their program .
that 's why there are serious doubts about how , under these circumstances , there can possibly be a fresh start to peace efforts . creating headaches before the election , it was already clear , particularly in israel , that hamas ' taking a seat in the palestinian government would not only create headaches for the israelis , but also for the united states and the european union .
all of these governments have classified hamas as a terrorist organization until now , and in the first instance , it 's difficult to see how hamas can suddenly become acceptable in political circles . still , washington has hinted at how it could be done - you could continue to deal with the palestinian government , minus its hamas members .
it 's a solution that 's already been employed in lebanon , where cabinet members loyal to hezbollah are ostracized .
like hamas , hezbollah is commonly regarded as a terrorist organization in the west .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2006 questions arise about keeping employees safe abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult for some firms to assess the risk of sending employees to danger spots after the kidnapping in iraq of two german engineers employed by the firm cryotec , the company 's management has come under criticism .
it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping . " it 's the wrong time to throw around such questions , " he said on thursday , adding that the security of the missing men should not be endangered . experience does n't always help still , the question remains about the criteria companies use in deciding whether to send employees into high-risk countries like iraq .
cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad .

cryotec was active in iraq long before saddam hussein was toppled and has very good contacts with people on the ground there . the company , which has 15 employees , is active around the world and has participated in projects under the un-sponsored " oil for food " program since 2000 .
two projects were completed in 2004 and a processor for making medical oxygen was delivered to an iraqi hospital in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene bräunlich , one of the two men kidnapped the two engineers who were sent to iraq had a great deal of trust in their boss .
one of them , 31-year-old rene bräunlich , had been in the country before and had already worked on projects in other dangerous nations , such as sudan . according to helmut harff , head of the committee for security issues at the germany 's largest industrial association , bdi , cryotec did not make any mistakes .
in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "
according to him , the final decision whether or not to send employees to dangerous regions rests with the company .
that is the case , he said , even though bdi adheres to the travel warnings posted by the german foreign ministry . " travel advisories are not legally binding , " he said . big firms and security but berthold stoppelkamp , head of the working group for economic security -lrb- asw -rrb- , is of another opinion , saying that no germans should be sent to iraq since the current situation is too dangerous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , left , at a crisis team meeting " if -lrb- cryotec -rrb- dispensed with bodyguards , they were not providing the protection that would have been needed in this case , " he told dw-world , adding that he did not want to make a final judgment until all the facts were in . his group is calling especially on small and medium-sized companies to take security issues very seriously when employees are sent abroad . " our experience show that most have no security plan whatsoever , " stoppelkamp said .
" we see time and time again that economic arguments are given priority over security concerns . "
he would not comment , however , on whether cryotec made a mistake in this particular case . larger firms , on the other hand , tend to take security issues into consideration , he added .
employees are often given training with external security consultants , behavioural experts and psychologists before they are sent abroad .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2006 study : moving production abroad can have positive effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german car industry is one which has profited from shifting production abroad the nightmare scenario of the german economy becoming one based on trade rather than production has some basis in fact .
but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .
the decision to move production abroad should be well thought out and on not made on the attraction of low wages alone , he added . the plus side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pharmaceutical industry in germany has flourished through foreign investment but not all foreign adventures fail .
german investments abroad , specifically by the automotive and chemical industries , have flourished through moving production out of the country .
both cars and chemicals have seen continuous growth abroad since 1994 and the profits have boosted the bottom lines of german-based companies as a result . " i would say that foreign investments , on the whole , are a potentially positive step for german industry , " said professor christoph scherrer of the university of kassel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.01.2006 opinion : dealing with hamas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leader and top candidate ismail hanieh salutes supporters depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp . that the militant islamist movement hamas would be a serious competitor for fatah and probably also take up posts in the palestinian cabinet was a sure thing even before the election .
but that hamas would win an absolute majority and be in a position to form the government itself - that 's something that not even hamas members or those who voted for them would have thought possible . for the voters , the fatah leadership had come to a crossroads : they stood accused of corruption , but what 's more , failure in their attempts to reach a peace agreement with israel . hamas , on the other hand , was seen by voters as being incorruptible and ready to take action .
that hamas also stands for the complete rejection of israel and the peace process , and is responsible for a long series of terrorist attacks - that was a matter of only secondary or tertiary importance for voters . fatah leader mahmoud abbas put a brave face on the situation , letting it be known before the election that he could well imagine a coalition with hamas - on the condition that hamas accept his political course .
and that means , as in the past , negotiations and peace with israel . negotiating with israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas wave flags during a rally if hamas now forms a government , these plans will become obsolete , unless hamas itself comes to the understanding that there will be no progress in the israeli-palestinian conflict if the palestinians turn back to the hard , uncompromising lines of the pre-oslo accord days , denying israel 's right to exist and using violence and terrorism to achieve their goals . hamas did not make such strategies part of their election campaign , but they remain a permanent part of their program .
that 's why there are serious doubts about how , under these circumstances , there can possibly be a fresh start to peace efforts . creating headaches before the election , it was already clear , particularly in israel , that hamas ' taking a seat in the palestinian government would not only create headaches for the israelis , but also for the united states and the european union .
all of these governments have classified hamas as a terrorist organization until now , and in the first instance , it 's difficult to see how hamas can suddenly become acceptable in political circles . still , washington has hinted at how it could be done - you could continue to deal with the palestinian government , minus its hamas members .
it 's a solution that 's already been employed in lebanon , where cabinet members loyal to hezbollah are ostracized .
like hamas , hezbollah is commonly regarded as a terrorist organization in the west .
but this solution would no longer be an option if hamas is the ruling power in the palestinian government . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamas set for shocking win exit polls indicate the militant hamas movement has claimed victory over the ruling fatah party in palestinian elections .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany . what do samsung in berlin , aeg in nuremberg and conti in hanover have in common ?
they are all companies where management centers , group bosses and even profitable production plants have pulled up stakes and moved out of germany . the rates of pay commanded by cheaper labor in eastern europe and south east asia have got a lot of executives asking themselves why they should still produce in germany .
could it be that germany will soon become , not only the export world champion when it comes to goods but also the global leader when it comes to exporting workforces ? there was a time when fathers would scare their children by saying the monsters under the bed would get them if they did n't eat their greens .
these days , it could be the story of how other countries could threaten germany by turning it into a " bazaar " economy where trade is everything because it produces nothing . these stories have been circulating for some time , aided and abetted by trade federations ' releasing doom-mongering statements like the one which said that 150,000 jobs would be shifted abroad by 2007 .
but on closer inspection , these stories appear to be nothing more than propaganda .
a report by the german chamber of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- in september stated that foreign investment by german companies was actually boosting employment in germany . dihk president ludwig georg braun has admitted that the balance is a positive one , a belief shared by wolfgang rohde , a member of the management board at trade union ig metall .
" the thesis is that the german economy and german employment have profited from the trend towards globalization , " rohde said , adding that only a quarter of production companies in germany saw any movement of activities outside germany between 2001 and 2003 . however , rohde believes the lure of cheaper labor and lower costs abroad remains strong .
" there remains a wider spectrum of economic opportunities for production in other industrial countries . " larger firms tend to go abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big groups in the electronics sector favor the conditions in foreign lands the fraunhofer institute of system and innovation research conducted a two-year survey of 1,500 german businesses in an attempt to gauge the feeling towards foreign investment .
the survey showed that it was predominantly large groups which were considering shifting production abroad and less the mid-sized companies . while there are positive conclusions to be made from the institute 's findings , that small to middle-sized enterprises were staying in germany and that a mass exodus was far from inevitable , the institute did see some problematic results . " the small and middle-class companies may look to the foreign investment strategies of the larger concerns and feel that they may be missing out on something , " steffen kinkel from the fraunhofer institute said .
" but the picture that everybody is running away from germany and producing abroad is a false one . " not always a happy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say that if a foreign investment does n't work out , then shut it down for those companies considering jumping ship , there are some lessons to be learned , kinkel warns .
firms that shift production to countries only because the wages are lower there can come away with a bloody nose . " from qualitative studies we know that two years is the test phase for any serious foreign investments .
if after two years things are n't working out then one should seriously think about getting out .
every fourth or fifth company shifting production abroad has moved it back after two years " sometimes , however , it 's too late .
" we looked at some business plans where companies have banked on successful foreign production and then we compared their forecasts with what really happened , " kinkel said .
the usual result is that the businesses invested two-and-a-half times more time and money into the foreign production than they intended in a bid to make a success of the shift abroad . pumping more investment into a project which extends the company past its intended target can often be dangerous , kinkel warns .

leaders echoed warnings there could be no dealings with it unless the party stopped seeking the destruction of israel . " the international community will want hamas to make a proper rejection of violence and to acknowledge that israel exists , " british foreign secretary jack straw said in a reaction typical of european nations in the wake of the shock outcome of elections in the palestinian authority . hamas , the islamic militant group , swept to victory over the long-dominant fatah party on thursday in palestinian parliamentary polls .
it is a political earthquake that could bury any hope for reviving peace talks with israel soon . eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the election result " may confront us with an entirely new situation , which will need to be analyzed by -lrb- eu foreign ministers -rrb- next monday . " austria , currently president of the eu , said it would judge the new government by the contribution it made to the peace process , the recognition of israel and the " two state " principle leading to the creation of a palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside a polling station in gaza city german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier urged hamas to reject violence and recognize israel , as did his counterparts in sweden , denmark , the netherlands and norway . french prime minister dominique de villepin expressed " concern " and said he hoped the " conditions which are indispensable for working with whatever palestinian government can be fulfilled . " italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi declared , " if this result is confirmed , then everything we had hoped for - to open a window to peace between israel and palestine - has been put back until who knows when . " us dismay " the united states does not support a political party that wants to destroy our ally israel , " us president george w. bush said during a white house news conference . " people must renounce that part of their platform .
a political party that articulates the destruction of israel as part of its platform is a party with which we will not deal . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas bush said that he would like to see palestinian leader mahmud abbas remain in office , despite the defeat of his fatah movement in the palestinian elections . the united states remains opposed to hamas but is convinced the palestinian people still want peace despite its victory , us secretary of state condoleezza rice said . " the palestinian people have apparently voted for change but we believe that their aspirations for peace and a peaceful life remain unchanged , " the chief us diplomat said in a statement read at the world economic forum in davos . hamas , which has spearheaded a deadly string of attacks against israel since its foundation in the late 1980s , claimed victory after taking part wednesday in its first palestinian general election . emergency meeting in israel israel 's acting leader ehud olmert was to convene an emergency security meeting thursday to discuss the ramifications of the hamas win .
israel has already warned that a hamas victory would ensure the peace process remains frozen . israel called on the european union on thursday to take a firm stance against the establishment of what it called a " terrorist government . " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni issued the appeal to the european union , the biggest donors to the cash-strapped palestinian authority , after meeting eu officials following hamas ' upset victory over the long-dominant fatah party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the middle east stability is even less certain today than it was yesterday russia was more circumspect in its reaction .
hamas should " speak in favor of a peaceful settlement and , as a result , of the creation of an independent palestinian state that would live in peace with israel , " russia 's special envoy to the middle east , alexander kalugin , was quoted by news agencies as saying . iran issued an unqualified statement of congratulations .
" in voting for hamas , the palestinians have chosen resistance " to israeli occupation , the foreign ministry spokesman , hamid reza assefi , said in a statement . and algerian foreign minister mohamen bedjaoui called on the west not to be too quick to pass judgment on hamas . " in the western world there is fear that hamas is radical but make no mistake about it , there are always groups that are even more radical , and the best way to combat radicalism is quite simply to start negotiations as soon as possible , " bedjaoui said after a meeting with his dutch counterpart ben bot in the hague . " it is when we sit at the negotiating table , when we talk , that we are not fighting , that no terrorist acts are committed , " the algerian minister said , calling on the palestinian and israeli authorities to get back to the negotiating table with the support of the international community . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dealing with hamas depending on the extent of hamas ' influence on the next palestinian government , the west could be in an unprecedented situation when it comes to continued mediation in the middle east conflict , writes dw 's peter philipp .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

it was irresponsible of them , some say , to send their employees into iraq . the fate of the two engineers is still uncertain and worries are growing among family members and co-workers at cryotec , based near leipzig .
there has been an outpouring of sympathy in the population and at the nikolai church in leipzig , special prayers are to held for the two during sunday services . at the same time , criticism is being increasingly directed at cryotec 's ceo , peter bienert . " those who sent these two technicians over there and had them working without protection carry a lot of the responsibility , " said gernot erler , germany 's deputy foreign minister , in an interview .
the one-time intelligence services coordinator and current christian democratic parliamentarian , bernd schmidbauer , raised serious accusations against cryotec 's management . " even the best business deal can not belie that fact that two co-workers were sent into enormous danger , " he said in an interview with dw-tv . warning against " hasty discussion " cryotec has not made any public comments and in a statement , ceo bienert asked for understanding about the company 's silence , saying that any information released could damage the work of the government crisis team trying to secure the engineers ' release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter bienert , head of cryotec according to cryotec , the two men travelled to iraq to work on the transfer of a facility which generates nitrogen for chemical processes . saxony 's christian democratic premier george milbrandt has warned against playing the blame game too quickly regarding cryotec 's responsibility for the men 's kidnapping .

in an interview with dw-world , he rejected the criticism of cryotec as " unfounded statements of opinion . "

palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet have already tendered their resignations . the ballots were still being counted on thursday morning when the militant hamas group laid claim to victory in the first palestinian parliamentary election in 10 years .
based on exit polls and first tallies , hamas appeared to have secured at least 70 of the 132 seats in parliament , thus giving the islamists a clear majority over the ruling fatah party .
according to a senior fatah official , the party has already conceded victory to hamas .
on thursday , palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie and his cabinet tendered their resignations to president mahmoud abbas , the official said . asked about hamas 's participation in the palestinian government , the group 's chief candidate ismail haniya remained elusive , limiting his comments to talk of " political partnership . " " in the light of these first results , we will consult president abu mazen -lrb- abbas -rrb- and the fatah brothers on the type of political partnership , " he told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians faced a historic choice in wednesday 's election the central elections commission said the announcement of the official result would be postponed until 7 p.m.
-lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
originally the outcome was expected for early thursday morning .
there was no reason given for the delay . turmoil expected a victory for the militant hamas group , which has claimed responsibility for dozens of suicide bombings against israel , could further jeopardize future mideast peacemaking .
already israel 's acting prime minister ehud olmert has said his country would not accept a palestinian government that includes hamas . " israel can not allow hamas to become part of the palestinian authority in its current form , " he said . the charter of hamas calls for the destruction of the jewish state and the group has vowed not to disarm after entering parliament . eu reaction the european commission said on thursday it would work with any palestinian government that used peaceful means . " it is clear that hamas has really got a very large proportion of the vote , " european external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner told a european parliament committee .
" what is important is that we state we are happy to work with any government if that government is prepared to work by peaceful means . " in contrast , us president george w. bush has cold-shouldered hamas , which he refers to as a terrorist organization . " a political party , in order to be viable , is one that professes peace , in my judgment , in order that it will keep the peace , " bush told the wall street journal .
" and so you 're getting a sense of how i 'm going to deal with the hamas if they end up in positions of responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian youths wear hamas head bands " countries in the region and the international community must respect our people 's choice , which is the result of democracy , " said hamas ' chief candidate , ismail haniya . palestinian leader mahmoud abbas also called on his people to recognize the vote as the voice of the people .
he said the palestinians had opened a new chapter in their troubled history and called for international assistance to revive the stalled peace talks . " we have embarked on a new era , and we need the international community 's help so that we can return to the negotiations on a final peace agreement with israel , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu could increase palestinian aid despite hamas victory radical islamist group hamas is likely to do well in wednesday 's palestinian parliamentary elections .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .

in his message devoted to the meaning of love , the pope lamented that , in contemporary society , sex had been degraded to a " commodity " to be bought and sold , but said erotic love between a man and a woman could transform itself into a selfless , spiritual love . benedict said christianity had not " poisoned eros , " as nietzsche had argued , and had not " blown the whistle " on the joy of god 's gift to mankind .
eros was a gift to be cherished , but an " intoxicated and undisciplined eros " was " a fall , a degradation of man , " he warned in the document . a front-page commentator in germany 's left-wing tageszeitung was not impressed with the pope 's letter on love , writing that while benedict clearly shows he is a learned man , his attempt to establish moral authority on the subject is not enough . " there 's nothing more beautiful or bigger than love , " the paper commented .
" but the pope knows little about what love is and how you live it . " " this may be part of his duties as catholic chief executive , but it is not helpful , " the taz concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has had mixed reactions to his letter on love in contrast , the süddeutsche zeitung deemed the pope 's letter to be " remarkable and , in many passages , outstanding . "
the paper was impressed by " the way in which there is often a thought-provoking , even searching quality to the encyclical , " but was critical of the fact that it did not address love between same-sex couples or unmarried people . " lyrical , impassioned meditation " the times of london described the encyclical as " a lyrical and impassioned meditation on the multiple dimensions of love , erotic as well as divine , and on love 's powers to heal and to inspire . "
benedict 's message has " evident charismatic potential , not least among the young , " the times said . but the dutch paper trouw said the pope 's ode on love has raised questions that catholics will now expect him to answer .
" how are we to understand love in relation to controversial things such as homosexual marriage , the ban on birth control , the role of women in the church and celibacy ? " the paper asked . the italian paper la stampa also commented that many readers of the encyclical could come away feeling unsatisfied " in the face of a document that , at first reading , seems not very pragmatic and almost abstract . " switzerland 's tages-anzeiger expressed its surprise that an ode to love should have come from the pen of joseph ratzinger who , before he became pope , was known for being a stern theologian .
" you get the impression that benedict xvi is trying to correct his image with his first encyclical , " the paper commented . austria 's der standard said that the document proves benedict 's critics wrong .
" even non-believers can agree with the pope 's criticism of ' eros ' being reduced to ' pure sex ' , " the paper commented , adding that " many of those who saw joseph ratzinger as an instrument of the holy inquisition , and perhaps continue to do so , are now probably disappointed .

the diary is published every thursday .
it 's -10c at mid-day in zagreb .
the wind cuts like a knife of ice .
and during the short walk to the low , squat building that is my destination , i can feel my body heat leaking away .
still , in the veterans ' club it 's warm , inside the fog of tobacco smoke , even if the men clustered around small tables radiate cold wariness .
croatia is next in the queue to join the european union after romania and bulgaria .
it hopes to be in by 2009 .
the way ahead is clear , after the croatian government helped with the capture of gen ante gotovina , who is now in the hague waiting to be tried for war crimes : the murder of serb civilians and the destruction of their homes .
for the men here , that 's an outrage .
in one of those spontaneous gestures that can never be recaptured on camera , the barman lifts a small snapshot of the general to his lips and kisses it with reverence .
along one wall of the bar , high up in a straight line , are colour photographs of burly , tough men in camouflage .
have your say " at least the croatians have allowed their alleged war criminals to be tried , which is more than some other countries " nigel myal , spain europe diary : your views some are dead .
some are in the hague .
all , for the people here , are heroes .
they feel bitter , and angry that the people who saved their country and fought off the serbian invaders are seen by their own government as criminals .
it is , perhaps , an extremely good thing that soldiers of a country that was victorious - in a war which most of the world regarded as just - can still be brought to account .
it 's pretty rare .
one of the seated veterans , a distinguished-looking man with silvery hair , wears a broad-brimmed black hat , a black leather jacket and black trousers , and looks for all the world as though he is auditioning for a morally ambiguous role in a psychological western .
unease most of his comrades , grizzled men also wearing black from head to toe , remind me of good old boys from the mid-west .
above the bar , in english , is a sign : " thank god i 'm croatian . "
their reasons why gen gotovina should not be tried in the hague are much the same as the united states ' reasons for rejecting the international criminal court - that any crimes committed are those of individuals , not military leaders , and should be tried in their own country .
but the feeling of unease is not confined to war veterans .
many people tell me that croatia is part of europe , and the european union should not be demanding so many changes .
for the political classes the worry is that the eu itself will change its mind .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy and others are making it clear that the eu ca n't get any bigger unless the rule changes in the constitution are brought in .
i am not sure whether they are using the constitution as a stick to beat enlargement , or enlargement as a lever to bring back the constitution .
technically they are right that the nice treaty does not allow for more than 27 members .
but in croatia the political classes worry that if the carrot of eu membership is taken away , reform will stop and extreme nationalism will return .
blue sky a day later we nearly fall victim to the bura - not some sinister organisation but a ferocious wind which whips down a range of mountains .
we are going to zadar , on the coast , to meet some british businesspeople .
because of the bura , the motorway is closed .
because of the bura , the police will not let us take the second route .
with no evidence of wind , we are forced to make a three-hour detour , across the bleak high plains .
only the beauty of a snow-capped range and the strings of wrecked and shattered villages relieve the monotonous landscape .
we are beginning to think that the bura is a traveller 's tall tale , a myth , especially when at the coast the sky is blue , the sun bright , the temperatures rising to a balmy freezing point .
the interviews under our belt , the return journey is different .
the bura cuffs and slaps at our van .
in one stretch of a few hundred yards , we see three vehicles much like our own , ripped and toppled onto their sides .
the police debate with the driver , but reluctantly let us through to the high pass road .
the driver says it 's perfectly safe .
he adds that it would be perfectly , perfectly safe , if we put a few hundredweight of rocks inside the van .
we decide on being perfectly , perfectly , perfectly safe and turn back to the long way round , where the risk is merely being blown over , not blown down a deep ravine .
eventually , we made it .
last week you made lots of interesting comments about plans to ban the burqa , what about banning the bura ?

the diary is published every thursday .
it 's -10c at mid-day in zagreb .
the wind cuts like a knife of ice .
and during the short walk to the low , squat building that is my destination , i can feel my body heat leaking away .
zagreb : body heat leaks away still , in the veterans ' club it 's warm , inside the fog of tobacco smoke , even if the men clustered around small tables radiate cold wariness .
croatia is next in the queue to join the european union after romania and bulgaria .
it hopes to be in by 2009 .
the way ahead is clear , after the croatian government helped with the capture of gen ante gotovina , who is now in the hague waiting to be tried for war crimes : the murder of serb civilians and the destruction of their homes .
for the men here , that 's an outrage .
in one of those spontaneous gestures that can never be recaptured on camera , the barman lifts a small snapshot of the general to his lips and kisses it with reverence .
along one wall of the bar , high up in a straight line , are colour photographs of burly , tough men in camouflage .
have your say at least the croatians have allowed their alleged war criminals to be tried , which is more than some other countries nigel myal , spain europe diary : your views some are dead .
some are in the hague .
all , for the people here , are heroes .
they feel bitter , and angry that the people who saved their country and fought off the serbian invaders are seen by their own government as criminals .
it is , perhaps , an extremely good thing that soldiers of a country that was victorious - in a war which most of the world regarded as just - can still be brought to account .
it 's pretty rare .
one of the seated veterans , a distinguished-looking man with silvery hair , wears a broad-brimmed black hat , a black leather jacket and black trousers , and looks for all the world as though he is auditioning for a morally ambiguous role in a psychological western .
unease most of his comrades , grizzled men also wearing black from head to toe , remind me of good old boys from the mid-west .
above the bar , in english , is a sign : " thank god i 'm croatian . "
their reasons why gen gotovina should not be tried in the hague are much the same as the united states ' reasons for rejecting the international criminal court - that any crimes committed are those of individuals , not military leaders , and should be tried in their own country .
gen gotovina is widely regarded as a war hero but the feeling of unease is not confined to war veterans .
many people tell me that croatia is part of europe , and the european union should not be demanding so many changes .
for the political classes the worry is that the eu itself will change its mind .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy and others are making it clear that the eu ca n't get any bigger unless the rule changes in the constitution are brought in .
i am not sure whether they are using the constitution as a stick to beat enlargement , or enlargement as a lever to bring back the constitution .
technically they are right that the nice treaty does not allow for more than 27 members .
but in croatia the political classes worry that if the carrot of eu membership is taken away , reform will stop and extreme nationalism will return .
blue sky a day later we nearly fall victim to the bura - not some sinister organisation but a ferocious wind which whips down a range of mountains .
we are going to zadar , on the coast , to meet some british businesspeople .
the bura sweeps over these slopes because of the bura , the motorway is closed .
because of the bura , the police will not let us take the second route .
with no evidence of wind , we are forced to make a three-hour detour , across the bleak high plains .
only the beauty of a snow-capped range and the strings of wrecked and shattered villages relieve the monotonous landscape .
we are beginning to think that the bura is a traveller 's tall tale , a myth , especially when at the coast the sky is blue , the sun bright , the temperatures rising to a balmy freezing point .
the interviews under our belt , the return journey is different .
the bura cuffs and slaps at our van .
in one stretch of a few hundred yards , we see three vehicles much like our own , ripped and toppled onto their sides .

the diary is published every thursday .
it 's -10c at mid-day in zagreb .
the wind cuts like a knife of ice .
and during the short walk to the low , squat building that is my destination , i can feel my body heat leaking away .
zagreb : body heat leaks away still , in the veterans ' club it 's warm , inside the fog of tobacco smoke , even if the men clustered around small tables radiate cold wariness .
croatia is next in the queue to join the european union after romania and bulgaria .
it hopes to be in by 2009 .
the way ahead is clear , after the croatian government helped with the capture of gen ante gotovina , who is now in the hague waiting to be tried for war crimes : the murder of serb civilians and the destruction of their homes .
for the men here , that 's an outrage .
in one of those spontaneous gestures that can never be recaptured on camera , the barman lifts a small snapshot of the general to his lips and kisses it with reverence .
along one wall of the bar , high up in a straight line , are colour photographs of burly , tough men in camouflage .
have your say at least the croatians have allowed their alleged war criminals to be tried , which is more than some other countries nigel myal , spain europe diary : your views some are dead .
some are in the hague .
all , for the people here , are heroes .
they feel bitter , and angry that the people who saved their country and fought off the serbian invaders are seen by their own government as criminals .
it is , perhaps , an extremely good thing that soldiers of a country that was victorious - in a war which most of the world regarded as just - can still be brought to account .
it 's pretty rare .
one of the seated veterans , a distinguished-looking man with silvery hair , wears a broad-brimmed black hat , a black leather jacket and black trousers , and looks for all the world as though he is auditioning for a morally ambiguous role in a psychological western .
unease most of his comrades , grizzled men also wearing black from head to toe , remind me of good old boys from the mid-west .
above the bar , in english , is a sign : " thank god i 'm croatian . "
their reasons why gen gotovina should not be tried in the hague are much the same as the united states ' reasons for rejecting the international criminal court - that any crimes committed are those of individuals , not military leaders , and should be tried in their own country .
gen gotovina is widely regarded as a war hero but the feeling of unease is not confined to war veterans .
many people tell me that croatia is part of europe , and the european union should not be demanding so many changes .
for the political classes the worry is that the eu itself will change its mind .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy and others are making it clear that the eu ca n't get any bigger unless the rule changes in the constitution are brought in .
i am not sure whether they are using the constitution as a stick to beat enlargement , or enlargement as a lever to bring back the constitution .
technically they are right that the nice treaty does not allow for more than 27 members .
but in croatia the political classes worry that if the carrot of eu membership is taken away , reform will stop and extreme nationalism will return .
blue sky a day later we nearly fall victim to the bura - not some sinister organisation but a ferocious wind which whips down a range of mountains .
we are going to zadar , on the coast , to meet some british businesspeople .
the bura sweeps over these slopes because of the bura , the motorway is closed .
because of the bura , the police will not let us take the second route .
with no evidence of wind , we are forced to make a three-hour detour , across the bleak high plains .
only the beauty of a snow-capped range and the strings of wrecked and shattered villages relieve the monotonous landscape .
we are beginning to think that the bura is a traveller 's tall tale , a myth , especially when at the coast the sky is blue , the sun bright , the temperatures rising to a balmy freezing point .
the interviews under our belt , the return journey is different .
the bura cuffs and slaps at our van .
in one stretch of a few hundred yards , we see three vehicles much like our own , ripped and toppled onto their sides .
the police debate with the driver , but reluctantly let us through to the high pass road .
the driver says it 's perfectly safe .
he adds that it would be perfectly , perfectly safe , if we put a few hundredweight of rocks inside the van .
we decide on being perfectly , perfectly , perfectly safe and turn back to the long way round , where the risk is merely being blown over , not blown down a deep ravine .
eventually , we made it .

by the winter of 1938 , hitler 's intention to victimise europe 's jews was clear .
synagogues burned , shops and homes were destroyed and , as communities were torn apart , the world awoke to the nightmare facing jews in nazi germany .
britain was shaken into action and prime minister neville chamberlain agreed to the rescue of as many jews as possible .
suddenly , saving the children became the top priority and so between december 1938 and the eve of war , 10,000 children travelled to the uk in an operation known as the kindertransport .
around 200 kindertransport children went to gwrych wales concert starts uk 's holocaust commemorations some were taken in by british families , some put in camps and others in hostels .
but for a lucky 200 , their sanctuary was gwrych castle , near abergele , north wales , which was given to the government as a place of refuge .
and for the first time in 60 years , some of those who lived at gwrych have returned to their childhood haunt .
in an emotional visit , osias findling said : " this place created a bond which lasted for a lifetime . "
amid tears , he said : " it 's very emotional to see this place again after 62 years and remember the happy days we had , and to think that the future we had was entirely different to the one we had imagined then . "
now all but derelict , gwrych castle has been left to crumble and decay .
but even seeing it now as a near ruin , osias and his friends still shared the fondest of memories during the saddest of times .
they recalled their sabbath suppers , the dance every saturday night and the day one of the organisers of the kindertransport was married at the castle .
but most of all they remember and thank the local people for the welcome they received .
" the welsh people were very hospitable and very kind to us , which we needed badly as children . "
' new life ' " having come from the terrible atmosphere in germany , it was wonderful to experience a free country - a democracy .
" for the first time , we were treated like human beings , equal to everyone else .
this place gave us a new life and we really felt what it meant to be free .
we will be eternally grateful to the welsh people for that . "
they , like the majority of the children , never saw their parents or any member of their families again .
but they are the lucky ones , for unlike the one and a half million children who perished in the holocaust , they survived .
holocaust day : a haven in wales is screened on bbc 2w on thursday at 2145 gmt .

estimated profits of a few hundred thousand euro for the fortnight 's golfing tournament are being bandied about .
however , the group remain tight-lipped and have their eyes firmly fixed on the ball .
they have already begun their pitch with a world-wide marketing campaign .

us fans will be in ireland to support their team " i think we 'd like to get as much as we can .

" looking from a corporate point of view you 'd have to ask how much would an american multinational be prepared to pay , but really some people are just throwing out figures left right and centre .
no fixed price has been decided on yet , " mr dunne said .

the exclusive k club is hosting the 2006 ryder cup but regardless of whether it is a string of winning birdies or eagles at the exclusive k club tournament in september , the residents of a kildare housing estate will be celebrating in style at their own 19th hole .
ten of them have united and intend to rent out their celbridge homes in the temple manor estate to european and american fans attending the tournament .
that way , no matter who wins - they win .
estimated profits of a few hundred thousand euro for the fortnight 's golfing tournament are being bandied about .
however , the group remain tight-lipped and have their eyes firmly fixed on the ball .
they have already begun their pitch with a world-wide marketing campaign .
although it is a modern suburban development , it is a close-knit community , with families in the development holidaying - and golfing - together .
pub dream the idea came up in the pub after some locals who had been to the ryder cup in spain in 1997 saw how scarce accommodation was .
niall dunne from temple manor said that big business interest in the event should provide a market for the houses .
prime location - up close to the k club and the ryder cup " ideally , we are aiming at the corporate sector of the market and , if someone wanted to bring over say 20 clients from the united states , we have the rooms in the houses here available , " he said .
" they are all self-contained houses , there are barbecue facilities .
one neighbour even has a swimming pool , so if we get any decent irish weather they can take a dip in the pool after the day , " he said .
the houses are five-star luxury , with each house boasting five double bedrooms .
debbie fealy said their target market would match up with the decor of the houses .
" we 'd like to work closely with the client to see what their specific needs are .
at the end of the day , we want to make sure that anyone staying here would have as enjoyable a time as possible , " she said .
just like ireland 's economic boom , the k club in county kildare did not exist 20 years ago , only opening in 1991 .
worldwide web neither did the internet , which has enabled a world-wide marketing drive to operate from the houses in celbridge , without the need for expensive advertising , office administration or middle men .
a dedicated website takes potential customers on a virtual tour and , already , the owners said , people from the usa , the uk and as far away as israel have made inquiries .
the houses do not come cheap , but no-one is saying for how much just yet , said niall dunne .
one newspaper suggested as much as 35,000 euro for each house , a figure which , said the group , " has been plucked out of the air " .
us fans will be in ireland to support their team " i think we 'd like to get as much as we can .
but we have to be realistic .
" looking from a corporate point of view you 'd have to ask how much would an american multinational be prepared to pay , but really some people are just throwing out figures left right and centre .
no fixed price has been decided on yet , " mr dunne said .

new scientist magazine reports that several prototypes of the radio-controlled robots are being tested in animal models .
they have been used to help perform gall bladder and prostate removal in pig experiments .
the university of nebraska team believe they could potentially revolutionise minimally invasive keyhole surgery . "
these robots will some day replace standard surgery " dr dmitry oleynikov there are several prototypes of the robots , each about 15 millimetres in diameter .
one has a camera attached , another is equipped with a needle that can extract a small piece of tissue for a biopsy .
the robot that moves around the abdominal cavity has a spiral pattern on its wheels , allowing it to transverse multiple organ surfaces and move around without slipping or damaging tissue .
easier surgery dr dmitry oleynikov , who invented the robots , believes they could make keyhole - or laparoscopic - surgery easier , and better for the patient , by requiring smaller , and perhaps fewer incisions .
and because the robots are so small and dextrous they give the surgeon a much broader visual field , unlike traditional laparoscopic cameras that are limited by freedom of movement .
in tests on a live pig , the robots were were inserted through the animal 's mouth , and once inside the stomach , surgeons cut a small hole in the stomach wall , which allowed the robot access to the whole abdominal cavity .
in the future , a surgeon removing a gall bladder or performing a liver biopsy may be able to introduce the robots via the patient 's mouth , then pass them through a small incision in the stomach wall .
dr oleynikov said : " these robots will some day replace standard surgery , and at some point the surgeon 's hands wo n't have to be in the body at all . "
he also hopes that in future the tiny machines may also play a big role in emergency medicine .
newer versions are being developed to stop internal bleeding by clamping , clotting or cauterizing internal wounds .
concerns mr christopher eden , a consultant urologist at the north hampshire hospital in basingstoke , told the bbc news website that a move to greater use of robots in surgery seemed inevitable .
however , he was concerned that the equipment was expensive , and would divert money away from training doctors how to carry out laparoscopic procedures .
he said keyhole surgery could be used to carry out complex surgery , such as prostate removal , but required lengthy and intensive training .
" my concern with robotics is that you are putting surgeons in a position where they are completely reliant on machines which are expensive , can wear out , and become obsolete , " he said .
" there is some scepticism in the uk about the idea that robot surgery is the best thing since sliced bread . "

by tim weber business editor , bbc news website , in davos byte by byte , the internet is taking away our privacy - but is that a good or a bad thing ?
are your personal details protected ?
remember the last time you shopped in your local supermarket ?
did the freckly 18-year-old at the till demand that you tell him your birthday , where you live , your e-mail address , and whether you are interested in music or sport ?

whoever knows your address can find out how many cars you 've got parked in your drive , what colour they are , and whether you have a swimming pool in your garden .

pre-tax profit for the three months to 31 december beat forecasts with a 51 % jump to 226bn yen -lrb- $ 1.95bn ; £ 1.1bn -rrb- .
the results were lifted by sales of the playstation portable games console , offsetting losses at its film division .
the figures prompted the company to drop its forecast of a first annual loss in 11 years .
flat-screen tvs sony saw strong sales of flat-screen lcd televisions , with japanese press reports saying it will meet rising demand for the screens by building a new factory in south korea with another manufacturer , samsung .
a lack of blockbuster movie success hit its movie division , where it made a 400m yen loss , compared with a 18.6bn yen profit a year earlier .
" this is an extremely positive result , easily outstripping expectations , " said mizuho securities analyst koichi hariya .
sony 's previous set of quarterly results had seen profits fall , hit by a slump in the price of televisions and costs related to the launch of its new games console .
last september , newly-appointed sony boss sir howard stringer launched a massive restructuring programme in an effort to revive the performance of the company 's consumer electronics division .
the plan involved 10,000 job cuts and 11 factory closures .
in the latest phase of sony 's restructuring , the firm announced on wednesday that it was ending the manufacture of its walkman portable music players in japan , shifting production to china and malaysia .
sony 's shares have now risen 38 % in the last three months .
a key factor in sony 's success this year will be its performance in the $ 25bn gaming industry .
it is due to launch its latest playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- games console in the spring , about six months behind microsoft 's rival xbox 360 player .

pre-tax profit for the three months to 31 december beat forecasts with a 51 % jump to 226bn yen -lrb- $ 1.95bn ; £ 1.1bn -rrb- .
the results were lifted by sales of the playstation portable games console , offsetting losses at its film division .
the figures prompted the company to drop its forecast of a first annual loss in 11 years .
flat-screen tvs sony saw strong sales of flat-screen lcd televisions , with japanese press reports saying it will meet rising demand for the screens by building a new factory in south korea with another manufacturer , samsung .
a lack of blockbuster movie success hit its movie division , where it made a 400m yen loss , compared with a 18.6bn yen profit a year earlier .

the plan involved 10,000 job cuts and 11 factory closures .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- the great alberta oil rush bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies thursday , 26 january 2006 , 09:19 gmt the great alberta oil rush by peter day presenter , bbc radio 4 and bbc world service canada is a modest and unassuming place when compared with its great big neighbour to the south .
but now it has plenty to boast about : world-beating oil reserves in alberta which are finally being brought into production after decades of talk .
alberta is experiencing a huge and expensive oil rush , and fort mcmurray is at the centre of it .
the town is an old trapper post , with no road until the 1960s , though it had a railway .
fort mcmurray 's population is now a runaway 68,000 , and climbing all the time .
for 30 years i 've heard about the promise of the vast alberta oil sands area , ever since the opec oil crises of the 1970s , when oil suddenly became worth much more than two dollars a barrel .
but decade after decade , it was only a promise of oil to come in alberta .
the oil is bound up in black bituminous sand close to the surface .
but even though the reserves are so huge and so obvious the oil sands have to be steam heated to release the oil .
potential gains until very recently , it 's been a prohibitively expensive process - but suddenly , with the world oil price well above $ 30 and now routinely above $ 60 , alberta oil is worth winning .
a recent recalculation has revealed that the amount of oil buried underneath the ground in northern alberta was not millions of barrels - but trillions .
alberta 's internationally recognised reserves are now put at 175 billion barrels of crude .
only saudi arabia has bigger reserves .
so now mighty corporations are pouring billions of dollars into the area around fort mcmurray .
in a chilly wilderness where the mercury sometimes freezes , under the brilliant illuminations of the aurora borealis , the northern lights , huge excavators are scraping off the topsoil and dumping the sticky sands underneath into the biggest dumper trucks in the world .
i rode on one .
it was a 400-tonner on which each of the six tyres costs £ 25,000 ; it feels like driving a house .
the next stage is a towering plant to liquefy the sludgy bitumen and create crude oil that can be pumped hundreds of miles in pipelines to the refineries .
back to the wilderness ?
and these deposits are guaranteed to last for decades , if not centuries .
flying in a helicopter over the oil sands area , you can see for fifty miles , and know that somewhere under the surface peaty , boggy " muskeg " as the canadian call it , oil sands stretch out almost forever .
this oil belongs to the province of alberta .
it is making it rich : a big place with a small population of three million people .
alberta has paid off its debts and has such a budget surplus already that it has just given every provincial taxpayer a rebate cheque for 400 canadian dollars , about £ 200 , as a sort of new year present .
but this is wilderness : haunt of the bear and the buffalo and the caribou and the moose .
the oil companies are promising to restore the land to what it looked like before , shifting back the washed sand minus oil of course , covering it with muskeg , and replanting the scraggy trees .
environmentalists -lrb- and the native first nation people -rrb- are not so sure that virgin wilderness can really be recreated ; the jury is still out .
old ways , new ways and this is happening a long way from almost anywhere .
to get some perspective on all this , i drove out to see a couple who have known fort mcmurray for more than 70 years .
over a cup of tea , bill woodward was soon showing me how to jump aboard a moving train without losing a leg in the process .
our conversation took place in a snug little lakeside cabin which the ex-hobos , bill and his wife nancy , have lived in since he came home from the second world war .
until the road came , they used to go shopping in the winter with a dogsleigh .
it was the frontier life canada 's original settlers must have experienced : trapping , fishing , living off what you could snare or shoot .
bob woodward is what the canadians call metis , a distinct aboriginal nation descended from native -lrb- indian -rrb- women and european incomer men .
his son rowland listened to us discussing the past , and then he said this , with quiet pride : " our people were not only buffalo hunters but also fishermen .
there are communities here that are more than 14,000 years old .
" three hundred years ago when the american trader peter pond came through here , he sat on the banks of the athabasca and the clearwater rivers and saw the local people -lrb- the cree indians -rrb- taking the bituminous sands and put them in a pot of hot water and then they 'd skim off the pitch and use it to waterproof their canoes .
" now , 300 years on , we 're still using the hot water extraction method .. and we 're still using it for transportation . "
so much has changed in the alberta wilderness , so much remains the same .
work in progress is the title of this exploration of the big trends reshaping the world of work as we steam further into the 21st century ; and it is a work in progress , influenced and defined by my encounters as i report on trends in business and organisations all over the world .
