the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .

"
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- germany passes anti-bias law broader than europe 's after years of trying , the german government has agreed on an anti-discrimination law that is broader than the rest of european legislation .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .

" we regret that no more congressmen or members of this administration and of the former one we had asked to meet have accepted or have been in a position to meet our delegation , " carlos coelho , chairman of the european group , said at a news conference on thursday . giovanni claudio fava , an italian member of the delegation , said senior state department officials who met with the group thursday would neither confirm nor deny the existence of secret cia prisons for terror suspects in europe . " no comme n t " as a valuable piece of i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fava 's report said there were over 1,000 secret cia flights across europe the us officials , he said , also remained mum on allegations that some 100 detainees were secretly flown by the cia through europe to countries like syria and egypt where they could be tortured , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . " nonetheless , fava said the delegation would head back to europe on friday on a positive note , as even a " no comment " can be construed as valuable information . in addition to meetings with members of the us administration , the delegation also has held talks with human rights organizations , lawyers and journalists . germany 's cem özdemir , the deputy chairman of the eu group , said it was clear from the discussions with state department officials that they did not see eye to eye . " we agreed we need to fight terrorism , but we did not agree on the means to fight terrorism , " özdemir said .
" it is important that us officials understand that we are concerned as representatives of 25 states . " u n clear how ma n y flights tra n sported terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir said it 's getting harder to tell the good guys from the bad guys last month the eu lawmakers released an interim report that said the cia operated more than 1,000 clandestine flights through europe since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
it is unclear , however , whether any of the flights were transporting terror suspects . " after 9/11 it was very clear who were the good guys and the bad guys , " özdemir told a panel discussion this week .
" but today i would not say the same thing anymore .
it is still clear who are the bad guys , but unfortunately , it 's more and more unclear who are the good guys . " john bellinger , the state department 's senior legal advisor , has acknowledged that the cia operated flights over europe but he has dismissed reports that most of the flights carried detainees . " despite a good deal of digging on the part of the press and non-governmental organizations , i do n't think anybody has ever suggested that there were more than two or three or four renditions that ever went through europe , " bellinger said after meeting with the eu parliamentarians .
" the suggestion that there have been 1,000 or 100 or even 10 , i think there is not any support for any of these allegations . " no n ew details made public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials said suspects would not be brought to countries where they could face torture he refused to elaborate on whether any terror suspects were taken to countries where they could be tortured or whether the cia ran secret prisons in europe . bellinger also denied reports that washington was applying pressure on east european countries that allegedly housed secret prisons - such as romania and bosnia-herzegovina - not to cooperate with the eu probe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.05.2006 paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no hay-pitching required : when hilton -lrb- left -rrb- has gotta go , she 's gotta go it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .
but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .
george n. and his son josef say they plan to auction off the toilet seat hilton used while she completed one of life 's simpler tasks . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from affluent to effluent : pensioner flushes fortune a 64-year old retired man from kiel had been sitting on a small fortune for the past four years without realizing it .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation .

"
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s .

some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clamping down on child neglect one of the shocking aspects of the recent harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .

do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

he also said he wanted his country to become a member of the world 's leading oil cartel , the organization of petroleum exporting countries . eu leaders used the forum to urge bolivia , as well as oil-rich venezuela , to cooperate with foreign powers and keep trade ties active . british prime minister tony blair called on morales and anti-us venezuelan president hugo chavez to use their nations ' petroleum resources " responsibly , " according to his spokesman .
blair " sent a double message " in letters to the two presidents although he did not meet them personally , spokesman ian gleeson said . " he said they should use their energy resources responsibly , and that in their own economic interest ... they should work with foreign investors , " gleeson said . french president jacques chirac said morales had reassured him that there would be no " expropriation " of the goods of foreign oil companies . chirac told reporters after meeting morales that the bolivian president " is anxious to have talks with energy companies and an agreement , at least this is what i understood , which rules out any attitude of expulsion or expropriation . "
populism could hurt trade ties , leaders warn un secretary general kofi annan , also attending the summit , said that globalization meant creating optimum conditions for investors who need to know " that the conditions under which they are making an investment will be sustained over the medium to the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales has european energy companies - and governments - concerned morales claimed a stunning victory in bolivia 's presidential election last december after pledging to take a bigger share of earnings from bolivia 's vast energy resources and nationalize the country 's oil and gas reserves . some 26 foreign companies , which include brazil 's petrobras firm and france 's total , now have six months to renegotiate their contracts with bolivia 's state-run hydrocarbons company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
during the transition period , 82 percent of profits will go to the bolivian state and 18 percent to the corporations . eu and latin american leaders at the vienna gathering warned that developing trade ties could be hit by populist moves by nations such as bolivia and venezuela to protect their energy sectors from foreign control . the summit of 60 heads of state and government heard calls for more balanced trade relations , with a joint final statement demanding a " more compatible regulatory regime . "
the statement does not refer to bolivia and venezuela by name , but clearly has them in mind - as did some of the speakers at friday 's plenary session . european commission chief jose manuel barroso called for a " convergence of interests , not only of values . "
mexican president vicente fox warned latin america that populism " hinders meeting the challenges we have . "
eu-central american free-trade zone the leaders adopted a 16-page joint statement stressing human rights , the fights against terrorism , drugs and organized crime , and concern for the environment , " including disaster prevention , " according to a draft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's chavez has also unnerved the europeans alluding to bolivia and venezuela , the statement said that " while acknowledging the sovereign right of countries to manage and regulate their natural resources , we will continue and strengthen our cooperation with a view to establishing a balanced trade framework and more compatible regulatory regime . " the final statement also said that the eu and six central american countries had agreed to open negotiations on setting up a free-trade zone .
the central american countries concerned are costa rica , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua , panama and el salvador . but the eu has been at odds to forge closer ties to two other latin american groupings , the andean community of nations and mercosur , the south american common market . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu still had " doubts whether the organization was currently in a phase to successfully carry out such negotiations .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

" the ' fans ' were very aggressive .
we hope we wo n't have to do this for real . " amid reports that polish hooligans are planning to run riot in germany during the world cup - with a june 14 first-round match between poland and germany in dortmund of particular concern - border guards and police from the two countries have been staging a series of joint exercises to hone their response to trouble . when the " hooligans " at lubieszyn began violently rocking their bus to chants of " ole , ole , ole , we wo n't give up , " brandishing bottles and blaring air horns , the border guards backed off until a special reinforcement unit with riot equipment arrived from the nearby city of szczecin . ma n y problem fa n s ba n n ed from traveli n g to cup poland has banned 600 known troublemakers from traveling to germany for the world cup , which runs until july 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are doing their best to keep problem fans out of germany that 's far less than the 3,500 hooligans banned by britain , but the german press has given high prominence to reports that polish hooligans are planning trouble . a pre-arranged mass brawl last november between german and polish hooligans in a forest on the two countries ' border has heightened fears of disturbances , as did a march clash between supporters of two krakow clubs that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man . a polish anti-fascist group has said it believes hooligans from poland want to cause chaos in the glare of the world media spotlight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is .

he also said he wanted his country to become a member of the world 's leading oil cartel , the organization of petroleum exporting countries . eu leaders used the forum to urge bolivia , as well as oil-rich venezuela , to cooperate with foreign powers and keep trade ties active . british prime minister tony blair called on morales and anti-us venezuelan president hugo chavez to use their nations ' petroleum resources " responsibly , " according to his spokesman .
blair " sent a double message " in letters to the two presidents although he did not meet them personally , spokesman ian gleeson said . " he said they should use their energy resources responsibly , and that in their own economic interest ... they should work with foreign investors , " gleeson said . french president jacques chirac said morales had reassured him that there would be no " expropriation " of the goods of foreign oil companies . chirac told reporters after meeting morales that the bolivian president " is anxious to have talks with energy companies and an agreement , at least this is what i understood , which rules out any attitude of expulsion or expropriation . "
populism could hurt trade ties , leaders warn un secretary general kofi annan , also attending the summit , said that globalization meant creating optimum conditions for investors who need to know " that the conditions under which they are making an investment will be sustained over the medium to the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales has european energy companies - and governments - concerned morales claimed a stunning victory in bolivia 's presidential election last december after pledging to take a bigger share of earnings from bolivia 's vast energy resources and nationalize the country 's oil and gas reserves . some 26 foreign companies , which include brazil 's petrobras firm and france 's total , now have six months to renegotiate their contracts with bolivia 's state-run hydrocarbons company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
during the transition period , 82 percent of profits will go to the bolivian state and 18 percent to the corporations . eu and latin american leaders at the vienna gathering warned that developing trade ties could be hit by populist moves by nations such as bolivia and venezuela to protect their energy sectors from foreign control . the summit of 60 heads of state and government heard calls for more balanced trade relations , with a joint final statement demanding a " more compatible regulatory regime . "
the statement does not refer to bolivia and venezuela by name , but clearly has them in mind - as did some of the speakers at friday 's plenary session . european commission chief jose manuel barroso called for a " convergence of interests , not only of values . "
mexican president vicente fox warned latin america that populism " hinders meeting the challenges we have . "
eu-central american free-trade zone the leaders adopted a 16-page joint statement stressing human rights , the fights against terrorism , drugs and organized crime , and concern for the environment , " including disaster prevention , " according to a draft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's chavez has also unnerved the europeans alluding to bolivia and venezuela , the statement said that " while acknowledging the sovereign right of countries to manage and regulate their natural resources , we will continue and strengthen our cooperation with a view to establishing a balanced trade framework and more compatible regulatory regime . " the final statement also said that the eu and six central american countries had agreed to open negotiations on setting up a free-trade zone .
the central american countries concerned are costa rica , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua , panama and el salvador . but the eu has been at odds to forge closer ties to two other latin american groupings , the andean community of nations and mercosur , the south american common market . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu still had " doubts whether the organization was currently in a phase to successfully carry out such negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 germany debates ethics of anonymous birth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving lives with the babyklappe , or baby slot , but at what cost ?
the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clamping down on child neglect one of the shocking aspects of the recent harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

" we regret that no more congressmen or members of this administration and of the former one we had asked to meet have accepted or have been in a position to meet our delegation , " carlos coelho , chairman of the european group , said at a news conference on thursday . giovanni claudio fava , an italian member of the delegation , said senior state department officials who met with the group thursday would neither confirm nor deny the existence of secret cia prisons for terror suspects in europe . " no comme n t " as a valuable piece of i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fava 's report said there were over 1,000 secret cia flights across europe the us officials , he said , also remained mum on allegations that some 100 detainees were secretly flown by the cia through europe to countries like syria and egypt where they could be tortured , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . " nonetheless , fava said the delegation would head back to europe on friday on a positive note , as even a " no comment " can be construed as valuable information . in addition to meetings with members of the us administration , the delegation also has held talks with human rights organizations , lawyers and journalists . germany 's cem özdemir , the deputy chairman of the eu group , said it was clear from the discussions with state department officials that they did not see eye to eye .

it is unclear , however , whether any of the flights were transporting terror suspects . " after 9/11 it was very clear who were the good guys and the bad guys , " özdemir told a panel discussion this week .
" but today i would not say the same thing anymore .
it is still clear who are the bad guys , but unfortunately , it 's more and more unclear who are the good guys . " john bellinger , the state department 's senior legal advisor , has acknowledged that the cia operated flights over europe but he has dismissed reports that most of the flights carried detainees . " despite a good deal of digging on the part of the press and non-governmental organizations , i do n't think anybody has ever suggested that there were more than two or three or four renditions that ever went through europe , " bellinger said after meeting with the eu parliamentarians .
" the suggestion that there have been 1,000 or 100 or even 10 , i think there is not any support for any of these allegations . " no n ew details made public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials said suspects would not be brought to countries where they could face torture he refused to elaborate on whether any terror suspects were taken to countries where they could be tortured or whether the cia ran secret prisons in europe . bellinger also denied reports that washington was applying pressure on east european countries that allegedly housed secret prisons - such as romania and bosnia-herzegovina - not to cooperate with the eu probe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .

but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .

despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .

the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .

" amid reports that polish hooligans are planning to run riot in germany during the world cup - with a june 14 first-round match between poland and germany in dortmund of particular concern - border guards and police from the two countries have been staging a series of joint exercises to hone their response to trouble . when the " hooligans " at lubieszyn began violently rocking their bus to chants of " ole , ole , ole , we wo n't give up , " brandishing bottles and blaring air horns , the border guards backed off until a special reinforcement unit with riot equipment arrived from the nearby city of szczecin . ma n y problem fa n s ba n n ed from traveli n g to cup poland has banned 600 known troublemakers from traveling to germany for the world cup , which runs until july 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are doing their best to keep problem fans out of germany that 's far less than the 3,500 hooligans banned by britain , but the german press has given high prominence to reports that polish hooligans are planning trouble . a pre-arranged mass brawl last november between german and polish hooligans in a forest on the two countries ' border has heightened fears of disturbances , as did a march clash between supporters of two krakow clubs that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man . a polish anti-fascist group has said it believes hooligans from poland want to cause chaos in the glare of the world media spotlight .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 germany debates ethics of anonymous birth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saving lives with the babyklappe , or baby slot , but at what cost ?
the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clamping down on child neglect one of the shocking aspects of the recent harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- germany passes anti-bias law broader than europe 's after years of trying , the german government has agreed on an anti-discrimination law that is broader than the rest of european legislation .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- new german government has nation in buoyant mood while the concrete achievements of germany 's " grand coalition " government in its first 100 days might be debatable , they 've left the country in a better mood .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

" the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .

"
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .

" the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .

" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed .

but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .
george n. and his son josef say they plan to auction off the toilet seat hilton used while she completed one of life 's simpler tasks . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from affluent to effluent : pensioner flushes fortune a 64-year old retired man from kiel had been sitting on a small fortune for the past four years without realizing it .

on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

he also said he wanted his country to become a member of the world 's leading oil cartel , the organization of petroleum exporting countries . eu leaders used the forum to urge bolivia , as well as oil-rich venezuela , to cooperate with foreign powers and keep trade ties active . british prime minister tony blair called on morales and anti-us venezuelan president hugo chavez to use their nations ' petroleum resources " responsibly , " according to his spokesman .
blair " sent a double message " in letters to the two presidents although he did not meet them personally , spokesman ian gleeson said . " he said they should use their energy resources responsibly , and that in their own economic interest ... they should work with foreign investors , " gleeson said . french president jacques chirac said morales had reassured him that there would be no " expropriation " of the goods of foreign oil companies . chirac told reporters after meeting morales that the bolivian president " is anxious to have talks with energy companies and an agreement , at least this is what i understood , which rules out any attitude of expulsion or expropriation . "
populism could hurt trade ties , leaders warn un secretary general kofi annan , also attending the summit , said that globalization meant creating optimum conditions for investors who need to know " that the conditions under which they are making an investment will be sustained over the medium to the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales has european energy companies - and governments - concerned morales claimed a stunning victory in bolivia 's presidential election last december after pledging to take a bigger share of earnings from bolivia 's vast energy resources and nationalize the country 's oil and gas reserves . some 26 foreign companies , which include brazil 's petrobras firm and france 's total , now have six months to renegotiate their contracts with bolivia 's state-run hydrocarbons company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
during the transition period , 82 percent of profits will go to the bolivian state and 18 percent to the corporations . eu and latin american leaders at the vienna gathering warned that developing trade ties could be hit by populist moves by nations such as bolivia and venezuela to protect their energy sectors from foreign control . the summit of 60 heads of state and government heard calls for more balanced trade relations , with a joint final statement demanding a " more compatible regulatory regime . "
the statement does not refer to bolivia and venezuela by name , but clearly has them in mind - as did some of the speakers at friday 's plenary session . european commission chief jose manuel barroso called for a " convergence of interests , not only of values . "

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?

the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity . " this amendment confuses consumers with contradictory messages and small print and should not be supported , " the european consumers ' organization -lrb- beuc -rrb- said in a statement .
" even worse , consumers might think wrongly that the reason the food is healthy is because of its ' increased ' salt , sugar or fat content . " the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .
not all eu member states have standard nutritional information labels common in the united states . according to a survey conducted by beuc last year , 53 percent of people place confidence in the labels that appear on food products they buy . problem lies with eati n g habits , n ot fatty foods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the food industry argues that individuals are responsible for deciding what they eat europe 's food lobby has worked hard to influence the legislation with around 100 representatives hoping to get the ear of parliamentarians on march 21 when the assembly 's health commission discussed the bill . the food industry has firmly opposed the plans , claiming " there are no bad products , only bad eating habits . "
industry representative argued that stricter advertising and labeling rules would subject food and beverage companies to a massive financial burden . the agreement appears to have watered down the commission 's plans .
but the eu executive 's spokesman for health issues , philip tod , seemed satisfied . " this compromise , if it is adopted , is nicely balanced because it retains the concept of a nutritional profile , even if there are some changes , " he said , adding that " consumers will be fully informed . " the idea of a " nutritional profile " was dropped last year , during the first reading of the draft legislation by the assembly , but was reintroduced after heavy pressure from consumer groups . the agreement comes as european and us officials , as well as representatives of the food and drink industry meet in brussels to discuss ways to combat obesity and its causes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sugar rush at cologne 's sweets fair participants at the international sweets and biscuits fair in cologne will tell you that their business has been less sweet than usual in recent years .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity .

" we regret that no more congressmen or members of this administration and of the former one we had asked to meet have accepted or have been in a position to meet our delegation , " carlos coelho , chairman of the european group , said at a news conference on thursday . giovanni claudio fava , an italian member of the delegation , said senior state department officials who met with the group thursday would neither confirm nor deny the existence of secret cia prisons for terror suspects in europe . " no comme n t " as a valuable piece of i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fava 's report said there were over 1,000 secret cia flights across europe the us officials , he said , also remained mum on allegations that some 100 detainees were secretly flown by the cia through europe to countries like syria and egypt where they could be tortured , a practice known as " extraordinary rendition . " nonetheless , fava said the delegation would head back to europe on friday on a positive note , as even a " no comment " can be construed as valuable information . in addition to meetings with members of the us administration , the delegation also has held talks with human rights organizations , lawyers and journalists . germany 's cem özdemir , the deputy chairman of the eu group , said it was clear from the discussions with state department officials that they did not see eye to eye . " we agreed we need to fight terrorism , but we did not agree on the means to fight terrorism , " özdemir said .
" it is important that us officials understand that we are concerned as representatives of 25 states . " u n clear how ma n y flights tra n sported terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : özdemir said it 's getting harder to tell the good guys from the bad guys last month the eu lawmakers released an interim report that said the cia operated more than 1,000 clandestine flights through europe since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
it is unclear , however , whether any of the flights were transporting terror suspects . " after 9/11 it was very clear who were the good guys and the bad guys , " özdemir told a panel discussion this week .
" but today i would not say the same thing anymore .
it is still clear who are the bad guys , but unfortunately , it 's more and more unclear who are the good guys . " john bellinger , the state department 's senior legal advisor , has acknowledged that the cia operated flights over europe but he has dismissed reports that most of the flights carried detainees . " despite a good deal of digging on the part of the press and non-governmental organizations , i do n't think anybody has ever suggested that there were more than two or three or four renditions that ever went through europe , " bellinger said after meeting with the eu parliamentarians .
" the suggestion that there have been 1,000 or 100 or even 10 , i think there is not any support for any of these allegations . " no n ew details made public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us officials said suspects would not be brought to countries where they could face torture he refused to elaborate on whether any terror suspects were taken to countries where they could be tortured or whether the cia ran secret prisons in europe . bellinger also denied reports that washington was applying pressure on east european countries that allegedly housed secret prisons - such as romania and bosnia-herzegovina - not to cooperate with the eu probe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2006 opinion : germany should capitalize on current optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the market for a new car ?
best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .

but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .

despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.05.2006 paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no hay-pitching required : when hilton -lrb- left -rrb- has gotta go , she 's gotta go it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .
but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.05.2006 paris hilton 's urge brings fame to bavarian farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no hay-pitching required : when hilton -lrb- left -rrb- has gotta go , she 's gotta go it 's usually a simple life for the folks in the rural bavarian hamlet of glonn .
but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity .

the european parliament and the eu 's member states have struck a compromise that could see foods high in fat and sugar continuing to be labeled as nutritious . the compromise , which could be voted through when the parliament has its second reading of the bill next week , has been slammed by europe 's main consumer watchdog as confusing and contradictory for shoppers . legislation was proposed by the european commission in 2003 to ensure that foods using tags like " high fiber , " " light " or " vitamin rich " also respect a " nutritional profile " on the quantities of fat , sugar and salt they contain . the proposed law was designed to stop manufacturers of products like lollipops - made essentially of sugar - from boasting that their products are low in fat . dual labels se n d co n fusi n g message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer groups want people to know exactly what they are biting into the new compromise , however , would allow such tags to be used even if the product is high in fat , sugar or salt as long as a label pointing that out appears on the same part of the packaging as the advertising , an eu official told the afp news agency on condition of anonymity .

" the only products that will continue to be subject to stricter marketing procedures will be those claiming to reduce a specific health risk , such as heart disease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- germany passes anti-bias law broader than europe 's after years of trying , the german government has agreed on an anti-discrimination law that is broader than the rest of european legislation .

" amid reports that polish hooligans are planning to run riot in germany during the world cup - with a june 14 first-round match between poland and germany in dortmund of particular concern - border guards and police from the two countries have been staging a series of joint exercises to hone their response to trouble . when the " hooligans " at lubieszyn began violently rocking their bus to chants of " ole , ole , ole , we wo n't give up , " brandishing bottles and blaring air horns , the border guards backed off until a special reinforcement unit with riot equipment arrived from the nearby city of szczecin . ma n y problem fa n s ba n n ed from traveli n g to cup poland has banned 600 known troublemakers from traveling to germany for the world cup , which runs until july 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are doing their best to keep problem fans out of germany that 's far less than the 3,500 hooligans banned by britain , but the german press has given high prominence to reports that polish hooligans are planning trouble . a pre-arranged mass brawl last november between german and polish hooligans in a forest on the two countries ' border has heightened fears of disturbances , as did a march clash between supporters of two krakow clubs that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man . a polish anti-fascist group has said it believes hooligans from poland want to cause chaos in the glare of the world media spotlight . " a large group of polish hooligans is preparing to travel to germany , " marcin kornak of the nigdy wiecej -lrb- never again -rrb- group , which campaigns against fascism and racism in soccer , told afp earlier this month .
" already they 're organizing , preparing for the world cup , to confront hooligans from other countries . " ogrodowicz said polish border guards were ready to take on any would-be troublemakers . " we have been training for the world cup for several months , " he said .

the bnd was especially interested in editors at the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . schäfer named five journalists who either offered to give information about their colleagues ' activities to the agency or did so under questioning . " blatant attack on press freedom " even up to last fall , the bnd collected such information on journalists .
they also kept places frequented by them and their informants under watch . schäfer characterized the practices according to the süddeutsche zeitung as " disproportionate , clearly illegal " and a blatant " attack on freedom of the press . " the top-secret 170-page report also confirmed that a journalist for stern magazine , who now works for süddeutsche zeitung , was tailed in january and february 1996 .
another journalist for weekly newsmagazine focus was monitored for years .
and an editor for südwest presse daily caught the agency 's attention .

" we are astonished that the bnd operated surveillance of journalists within germany , " a spokesman for the magazine said . admitting mistakes the intelligence agency admitted on friday that mistakes had been made after the report was leaked and said that its top officials had held " amicable " meetings with the journalists concerned . " former bnd president august hanning and his successor ernst uhrlau had talks with the journalists six months ago , " a spokesman for the agency said .
" in that meeting , it was publicly recognized that mistakes had been made . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary committee is also investigating the agency 's role in iraq the german journalists ' association djv said the revelations in the report were " scandalous " and demanded that the report be made public . " it is unacceptable that a report with such explosive content is being dealt with behind closed doors , " djv head michael konken told afp . government spokesman thomas steg said he could not comment on the top-secret report , which will be considered by parliamentary authorities in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2006 opinion : germany should capitalize on current optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the market for a new car ?
best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .
-lrb- jan.9 , 2006 -rrb- experts predict sunnier days ahead for german economy euro zone growth is gaining momentum amid surprisingly strong activity in germany , the european commission said tuesday , a day after the ifo research institute predicted unexpected levels of growth in the german economy .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

we hope we wo n't have to do this for real . " amid reports that polish hooligans are planning to run riot in germany during the world cup - with a june 14 first-round match between poland and germany in dortmund of particular concern - border guards and police from the two countries have been staging a series of joint exercises to hone their response to trouble . when the " hooligans " at lubieszyn began violently rocking their bus to chants of " ole , ole , ole , we wo n't give up , " brandishing bottles and blaring air horns , the border guards backed off until a special reinforcement unit with riot equipment arrived from the nearby city of szczecin . ma n y problem fa n s ba n n ed from traveli n g to cup poland has banned 600 known troublemakers from traveling to germany for the world cup , which runs until july 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are doing their best to keep problem fans out of germany that 's far less than the 3,500 hooligans banned by britain , but the german press has given high prominence to reports that polish hooligans are planning trouble . a pre-arranged mass brawl last november between german and polish hooligans in a forest on the two countries ' border has heightened fears of disturbances , as did a march clash between supporters of two krakow clubs that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man . a polish anti-fascist group has said it believes hooligans from poland want to cause chaos in the glare of the world media spotlight . " a large group of polish hooligans is preparing to travel to germany , " marcin kornak of the nigdy wiecej -lrb- never again -rrb- group , which campaigns against fascism and racism in soccer , told afp earlier this month .

instead , the agency arranged for journalists to tell on their colleagues in order to learn what they were working on .
the bnd was especially interested in editors at the weekly newsmagazine der spiegel . schäfer named five journalists who either offered to give information about their colleagues ' activities to the agency or did so under questioning . " blatant attack on press freedom " even up to last fall , the bnd collected such information on journalists .
they also kept places frequented by them and their informants under watch . schäfer characterized the practices according to the süddeutsche zeitung as " disproportionate , clearly illegal " and a blatant " attack on freedom of the press . " the top-secret 170-page report also confirmed that a journalist for stern magazine , who now works for süddeutsche zeitung , was tailed in january and february 1996 .
another journalist for weekly newsmagazine focus was monitored for years .
and an editor for südwest presse daily caught the agency 's attention .
they especially kept in their sights the house of journalist erich schmidt-eenboom in weilhiem , who in 1993 published a book on the agency that angered the bnd 's top leadership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt-eenboom was watched and his files leafed through by spies the report said that agents often destroyed files .

" we are astonished that the bnd operated surveillance of journalists within germany , " a spokesman for the magazine said . admitting mistakes the intelligence agency admitted on friday that mistakes had been made after the report was leaked and said that its top officials had held " amicable " meetings with the journalists concerned . " former bnd president august hanning and his successor ernst uhrlau had talks with the journalists six months ago , " a spokesman for the agency said .
" in that meeting , it was publicly recognized that mistakes had been made . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a parliamentary committee is also investigating the agency 's role in iraq the german journalists ' association djv said the revelations in the report were " scandalous " and demanded that the report be made public . " it is unacceptable that a report with such explosive content is being dealt with behind closed doors , " djv head michael konken told afp . government spokesman thomas steg said he could not comment on the top-secret report , which will be considered by parliamentary authorities in june .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .
" our first priority is the right to life and the child 's well-being . " a crimi n al offe n ce nonetheless , their defense - well-meaning as it is - also highlights the problems inherent in anonymous birth .
ethical matters such as child 's right to know its parents and a parent 's duty to a child aside , law experts agree the practice is actually illegal , but tolerated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law turns a blind eye to anonymous birth " every time a hospital carries out an anonymous birth , it 's committing a criminal offence , " said cdu member of parliament beatrix philipp , a vocal opponent of the babyklappen .
" by offering this service , you actually create a demand .
a generation of foundlings is emerging in germany , with state approval .
it 's time public prosecutors intervened to shut down these babyklappen and ensure anonymous birth is not legitimized by hospitals . " alfred wolf , a professor of law at the humboldt university who has written extensively on the issue , agreed . " what it does is actually encourage women to break the law , " he said .
" we do n't even need new laws , we need to enforce existing ones .
this is a violation of public order .
no matter how desperate these women might be , they always have legal options available to them . " emotio n ally charged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first baby drop station was in hamburg " babyklappen are a pseudo-solution , " wolf said , stressing that they fail to address the social roots of the problem .
" but overhauling our social system is time-consuming and expensive .
and welfare offices are under a lot of political pressure . " the political pressure he refers to derives from the fact that although experts fear anonymous birth is a legally unsound procedure open to various forms of abuse , public support makes outlawing it a thorny issue . " this is a very emotionally charged debate , " philipp said .
" it would be very difficult to clamp down - it would never be a popular decision . " who is helpi n g who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand for children to adopt is rising many suspect that too many people have a vested interest in anonymous birth . when a child is born anonymously , the clinic is left with the costs of the birth .
while it will usually foot the bill itself , or - as in the case of the catholic st marienstift in magdeburg - can turn to religious organizations or charities such as sternipark , there are other , more sinister options . " an insurer will actually treat a couple adopting as the biological parents if they take a child born anonymously immediately rather than waiting the statutory eight weeks , " wolf said .
" this can only be an advantage to international child trafficking .
people can not believe this is happening in germany , but it is .

the recent case of a woman charged with murdering eight of her babies has re-focused public attention on the thorny issue of " baby slots . "
do they really prevent infanticide , and are they legal ? according to the pro anonymous birth camp , the lives of eight babies might have been saved if their mother had been able to deposit her new-born infants in what 's known in germany as a " babyklappe , " a heated , incubator-like container usually built into a hospital wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it saves one life , it 's worth it " in the same week the woman accused of killing her babies appeared in court in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the third babyklappe in saxony-anhalt opened at magdeburg 's st. marienstift hospital , which publicly admits it allows anonymous births . " it happens more often than people think , " said heike auricchio , a doctor at the clinic .
" no one wants anonymous births to be anything other than an exception , but it is a necessary option for desperate women . " with 80 babyklappen now spread across the nation , germany has seen something of a baby slot boom since the hamburg-based organization " sternipark " unveiled the first in the country in 2000 .
in the first year alone , 13 babies were left in sternipark 's drop-off point , corroborating the project 's belief that it offers an invaluable social service . " if we manage to save one life this way , then it 's worth it , " said sternipark 's kathrin kliesow . givi n g wome n a n easy way out but while the advocates of babyklappen say they prevent distraught women from leaving their babies to die in cellars or garbage cans , the critics say they offer women a convenient way of getting rid of an unwanted baby without having to jump through daunting bureaucratic hoops . not so , said kliesow . " obviously , we 'd rather talk to the women first and offer support , " she said .
" the babyklappe should only ever be a last resort .
but these women are having a baby , whatever happens , and it 's first and foremost a question of helping them do so safely , and without risk of legal recrimination . " auricchio also stressed that anonymous birth is only ever an eleventh-hour option . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many argue that the child 's interests come first " we talk to women about their options and often we can persuade them to accept their child , " she said .

an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis . "
" we all know what was said in the election campaign , " a leading cdu politician told the berliner zeitung . amid increasingly critical voices within her party , merkel this week pointed towards the need for compromise within the governing coalition as the reason for her agreeing to give the green light to the legislation . need to compromise though that has n't entirely silenced her critics , it has underlined the compulsion to compromise within the grand coalition , a political experiment that has only been attempted once before in german history , in the 1960s . " once you 've said yes to the grand coalition , then you have to say yes to the partner too .
you have to take it as it is , " csu regional head peter ramsauer told his party colleagues this week . the same logic is being applied within the ranks of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- too , where some members are disgruntled because they view their party as making excessive concessions to the conservatives .
some spd members feel that the party has compromised core values by giving in to a further budgetary squeeze on dwindling unemployment and social handouts and a diluted " wealth tax " that will oblige high earners to pay more in taxes . too much blind compromise ? however , questions are being raised whether the compromise element should be blindly stressed in a grand coalition or whether more intense discussion about contentious topics is needed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much of a good thing ?
" not every row should be sacrificed at the altar of coalition peace .
there should n't be an impression in future that we 're not fighting , " hendrik wüst , secretary general of the cdu in the state of north rhine-westphalia told business daily handelsblatt .
the anti-discrimination law " wo n't be the last time that the conservatives simply swallow and stay silent , " csu member andreas scheuer told the spiegel-online news site . though it remains unclear whether the conservatives will block the anti-discrimination legislation when it 's introduced in parliament next week , there are indications that pragmatic concerns might override ideological ones . german government spokesman thomas steg said this week that the law had to take effect on august 1 for germany to escape penalties from brussels - a whopping 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 760,000 euros -rrb- for each day that germany fails to implement the law . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's first big health-care test one of angela merkel 's most important reform projects comes under the microscope on wednesday : will germany 's two major parties move closer on health-care reform ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2006 bill tests german coalition 's willingness to compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's own party colleagues are beginning to complain behind her back the first cracks are appearing in the governing coalition of social democrats and conservatives who are bound by a tacit need for compromise .
an anti-discrimination law lies at the heart of the discontent . this week germany 's grand coalition showed itself to be what it really is : a grouping of separate parties with differing agendas and ideas of how to tackle the problems ailing the country . nowhere was that more evident than an anti-discrimination law finally decided upon by the cabinet this week in the face of dissenting rumblings . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have suggested that cdu leader and chancellor angela merkel ceded too much ground to the social democratic union -lrb- spd -rrb- by accommodating too many of their viewpoints in the final legislation . " it 's a hugely bitter pill that we have to swallow , " an unnamed csu insider told the berliner zeitung daily . law too close to last government ? as required by the european union , the legislation is meant to protect against discrimination based on sex , ethnic origin or race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the law will also protect senior citizens from being discriminated against however , the german version goes beyond eu guidelines to include discrimination based on religion , weltanschauung , disability , age and sexual identity .
thus , for example the law will protect senior citizens from being refused bank loans or homosexual couples being refused double rooms in hotels .
the bill also allows a works council to file a complaint on behalf of an employee who claims discrimination but does not want to take action alone . some conservatives fear the extended law will only lead to more bureaucracy and needlessly expensive litigation for companies .
many also think the bill sounds suspiciously close to the original framework hammered out by the previous government of social democrats and greens led by gerhard schröder , which was blocked by the conservatives . merkel under fire bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party members think she 's giving too much away for the sake of coalition politics what 's particularly irksome to some is that merkel pushed through the legislation during a party conference this week despite campaigning last year with a promise to implement the eu guidelines on the anti-discrimination law on a " one-to-one basis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2006 carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon market is valued at 11 billion euros it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say . the carbon expo is the only trade fair of its kind which focuses on emissions trading and the reduction of harmful greenhouse gases which cause climate change .
the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .

but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .
george n. and his son josef say they plan to auction off the toilet seat hilton used while she completed one of life 's simpler tasks . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from affluent to effluent : pensioner flushes fortune a 64-year old retired man from kiel had been sitting on a small fortune for the past four years without realizing it .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .

he also said he wanted his country to become a member of the world 's leading oil cartel , the organization of petroleum exporting countries . eu leaders used the forum to urge bolivia , as well as oil-rich venezuela , to cooperate with foreign powers and keep trade ties active . british prime minister tony blair called on morales and anti-us venezuelan president hugo chavez to use their nations ' petroleum resources " responsibly , " according to his spokesman .
blair " sent a double message " in letters to the two presidents although he did not meet them personally , spokesman ian gleeson said . " he said they should use their energy resources responsibly , and that in their own economic interest ... they should work with foreign investors , " gleeson said . french president jacques chirac said morales had reassured him that there would be no " expropriation " of the goods of foreign oil companies . chirac told reporters after meeting morales that the bolivian president " is anxious to have talks with energy companies and an agreement , at least this is what i understood , which rules out any attitude of expulsion or expropriation . "
populism could hurt trade ties , leaders warn un secretary general kofi annan , also attending the summit , said that globalization meant creating optimum conditions for investors who need to know " that the conditions under which they are making an investment will be sustained over the medium to the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales has european energy companies - and governments - concerned morales claimed a stunning victory in bolivia 's presidential election last december after pledging to take a bigger share of earnings from bolivia 's vast energy resources and nationalize the country 's oil and gas reserves . some 26 foreign companies , which include brazil 's petrobras firm and france 's total , now have six months to renegotiate their contracts with bolivia 's state-run hydrocarbons company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
during the transition period , 82 percent of profits will go to the bolivian state and 18 percent to the corporations . eu and latin american leaders at the vienna gathering warned that developing trade ties could be hit by populist moves by nations such as bolivia and venezuela to protect their energy sectors from foreign control . the summit of 60 heads of state and government heard calls for more balanced trade relations , with a joint final statement demanding a " more compatible regulatory regime . "
the statement does not refer to bolivia and venezuela by name , but clearly has them in mind - as did some of the speakers at friday 's plenary session . european commission chief jose manuel barroso called for a " convergence of interests , not only of values . "
mexican president vicente fox warned latin america that populism " hinders meeting the challenges we have . "
eu-central american free-trade zone the leaders adopted a 16-page joint statement stressing human rights , the fights against terrorism , drugs and organized crime , and concern for the environment , " including disaster prevention , " according to a draft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's chavez has also unnerved the europeans alluding to bolivia and venezuela , the statement said that " while acknowledging the sovereign right of countries to manage and regulate their natural resources , we will continue and strengthen our cooperation with a view to establishing a balanced trade framework and more compatible regulatory regime . " the final statement also said that the eu and six central american countries had agreed to open negotiations on setting up a free-trade zone .
the central american countries concerned are costa rica , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua , panama and el salvador . but the eu has been at odds to forge closer ties to two other latin american groupings , the andean community of nations and mercosur , the south american common market . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu still had " doubts whether the organization was currently in a phase to successfully carry out such negotiations .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

he also said he wanted his country to become a member of the world 's leading oil cartel , the organization of petroleum exporting countries . eu leaders used the forum to urge bolivia , as well as oil-rich venezuela , to cooperate with foreign powers and keep trade ties active . british prime minister tony blair called on morales and anti-us venezuelan president hugo chavez to use their nations ' petroleum resources " responsibly , " according to his spokesman .
blair " sent a double message " in letters to the two presidents although he did not meet them personally , spokesman ian gleeson said . " he said they should use their energy resources responsibly , and that in their own economic interest ... they should work with foreign investors , " gleeson said . french president jacques chirac said morales had reassured him that there would be no " expropriation " of the goods of foreign oil companies . chirac told reporters after meeting morales that the bolivian president " is anxious to have talks with energy companies and an agreement , at least this is what i understood , which rules out any attitude of expulsion or expropriation . "
populism could hurt trade ties , leaders warn un secretary general kofi annan , also attending the summit , said that globalization meant creating optimum conditions for investors who need to know " that the conditions under which they are making an investment will be sustained over the medium to the long term . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales has european energy companies - and governments - concerned morales claimed a stunning victory in bolivia 's presidential election last december after pledging to take a bigger share of earnings from bolivia 's vast energy resources and nationalize the country 's oil and gas reserves . some 26 foreign companies , which include brazil 's petrobras firm and france 's total , now have six months to renegotiate their contracts with bolivia 's state-run hydrocarbons company yacimientos petroliferos fiscales bolivianos -lrb- ypfb -rrb- .
during the transition period , 82 percent of profits will go to the bolivian state and 18 percent to the corporations . eu and latin american leaders at the vienna gathering warned that developing trade ties could be hit by populist moves by nations such as bolivia and venezuela to protect their energy sectors from foreign control . the summit of 60 heads of state and government heard calls for more balanced trade relations , with a joint final statement demanding a " more compatible regulatory regime . "
the statement does not refer to bolivia and venezuela by name , but clearly has them in mind - as did some of the speakers at friday 's plenary session . european commission chief jose manuel barroso called for a " convergence of interests , not only of values . "
mexican president vicente fox warned latin america that populism " hinders meeting the challenges we have . "
eu-central american free-trade zone the leaders adopted a 16-page joint statement stressing human rights , the fights against terrorism , drugs and organized crime , and concern for the environment , " including disaster prevention , " according to a draft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuela 's chavez has also unnerved the europeans alluding to bolivia and venezuela , the statement said that " while acknowledging the sovereign right of countries to manage and regulate their natural resources , we will continue and strengthen our cooperation with a view to establishing a balanced trade framework and more compatible regulatory regime . " the final statement also said that the eu and six central american countries had agreed to open negotiations on setting up a free-trade zone .
the central american countries concerned are costa rica , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua , panama and el salvador . but the eu has been at odds to forge closer ties to two other latin american groupings , the andean community of nations and mercosur , the south american common market . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the eu still had " doubts whether the organization was currently in a phase to successfully carry out such negotiations .

" the ' fans ' were very aggressive .
we hope we wo n't have to do this for real . " amid reports that polish hooligans are planning to run riot in germany during the world cup - with a june 14 first-round match between poland and germany in dortmund of particular concern - border guards and police from the two countries have been staging a series of joint exercises to hone their response to trouble . when the " hooligans " at lubieszyn began violently rocking their bus to chants of " ole , ole , ole , we wo n't give up , " brandishing bottles and blaring air horns , the border guards backed off until a special reinforcement unit with riot equipment arrived from the nearby city of szczecin . ma n y problem fa n s ba n n ed from traveli n g to cup poland has banned 600 known troublemakers from traveling to germany for the world cup , which runs until july 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities are doing their best to keep problem fans out of germany that 's far less than the 3,500 hooligans banned by britain , but the german press has given high prominence to reports that polish hooligans are planning trouble . a pre-arranged mass brawl last november between german and polish hooligans in a forest on the two countries ' border has heightened fears of disturbances , as did a march clash between supporters of two krakow clubs that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old man . a polish anti-fascist group has said it believes hooligans from poland want to cause chaos in the glare of the world media spotlight . " a large group of polish hooligans is preparing to travel to germany , " marcin kornak of the nigdy wiecej -lrb- never again -rrb- group , which campaigns against fascism and racism in soccer , told afp earlier this month .
" already they 're organizing , preparing for the world cup , to confront hooligans from other countries . " ogrodowicz said polish border guards were ready to take on any would-be troublemakers . " we have been training for the world cup for several months , " he said .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

but an unexpected visit from a certain infamous socialite gave their town a dose of celebrity . when nature calls , paris hilton answers - even if she happens to be in a helicopter at the time .
on a recent publicity trip to the tyrolean mountain town of ischgl , hilton - an heiress to the hilton hotel chain and party girl par excellence - felt the urge to use a bathroom .
quickly . in response , germany 's bild newspaper said , the helicopter hilton was riding in made an unscheduled stop at the farm of a certain george n. in the picturesque upper bavarian village of glonn , population 4,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how much will a famous toilet seat get , but rather , who would buy it ?
it seems the person flying the chopper knew the folks and decided the unremarkable farmhouse was the most convenient place for her to spend one of her family 's countless pennies in a pinch .
despite the fact that she is arguably best known for her role in the private sex video " one night in paris " - which was leaked onto the internet by her ex-boyfriend rick salomon - in some instances hilton apparently places great importance on privacy .
german news portal spiegel online reported that hilton had the farm family banished from the house before visiting the little girls ' room , and while she was there , she was guarded by two bodyguards .
afterward , she went out on the balcony and had a smoke , although she crouched down so no one could see her .
the web site did not record her impression of the bucolic alpine views .
the heiress gained international notoriety with a reality-television show called the simple life , which followed the tribulations of hilton and another pampered society teen as they engaged in everyday tasks - like farm work .
now , one hardworking farm family might be able to turn the tables and use hilton 's celebrity status to improve their own financial standing .
george n. and his son josef say they plan to auction off the toilet seat hilton used while she completed one of life 's simpler tasks . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from affluent to effluent : pensioner flushes fortune a 64-year old retired man from kiel had been sitting on a small fortune for the past four years without realizing it .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

best buy before the end of this year germany 's economy , at last , has begun sending off healthy signals , largely based on one-time consumer spending .
but dw 's karl zawadzky wonders if today 's good mood is enough to solve the country 's long-term woes . finally : germany 's economy has gained a foothold and is starting to climb .
while the economy was stagnant in the last quarter of 2005 , the first quarter of the current year saw 0.4 percent growth , and all signs show that trend improving .
the government 's growth forecast of 1.6 percent may well be reached this year - and perhaps even exceeded . such growth is desperately needed in order to solve the country 's diverse economic problems , from joblessness to the growing national debt .
the old rule still applies : growth is n't everything , but without growth , everything comes to nothing . there have been some recognizable , early successes .
job losses are narrowing , and tax revenue is up .
semiannual tax estimates showed a likely 8.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- increase in revenue for the state this year , compared to last november . bid to meet eu stability criteria that 's good news , because the increase is coming , above all , from income-related corporate and trade taxes , as well as income taxes from executives and employees .
businesses and business owners are doing better this year than last , with estimations running to a revenue increase of more than 20 billion euros . it seems likely that by 2007 at the latest , germany will meet the eu 's deficit criteria for the european growth and stability pact , which was set up alongside the introduction of the euro currency .
for the past four years , germany has breached the criteria set by the pact , which limits government budget deficits to 3 percent of the gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angie would like to see germany meet eu stability criteria by next year german chancellor angela merkel has said she is determined to meet the rules next year .
the problem with this , however , is that if the criteria are met , it will not be because of reductions in state spending but thanks to greater tax revenues . a planned 3 percent increase in the value-added tax starting in 2007 is likely to significantly curtail private consumption .
so anyone planning to buy a new car , washing machine or set of living-room furniture will be sure to buy it before the end of december , as such goods will be at least 3 percent more expensive in 2007 .
experience also shows that businesses often take such tax increases as an opportunity to boost prices a little further . illusory gains ? this , in turn , means personal consumption is likely to show a strong increase in the second half of the year - and is just as likely to plummet in the beginning of next year .
thus any economic improvement tied to personal consumption is more illusory than real . for years , the economic mood of the country was worse than the reality .
now , the opposite is true .
optimism has displaced reality .
this is a welcome phenomenon since a large part of successful economic policy relies on applied psychology .
and it 's especially true when dealing with private consumption , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the gross national product . the german government is trying to stimulate the economy this year to such a degree that it can withstand the major setbacks that are widely expected with increasing the vat tax next year .
at this point , the government ca n't do away with the tax increase - the money has long been accounted for .
so it is left hoping that the economy will in fact become so strong that it can survive the unavoidable blow . karl zawadzky -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism and growth forecasts high for germany in 2006 germany , long seen as the sick man of europe , is back on the road to health this year , even if plans to raise value-added tax in 2007 could mean the recovery will be short-lived , analysts said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2006 carbon emissions traders carefully optimistic in cologne großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon market is valued at 11 billion euros it 's been a year since the eu launched its first carbon trading market and things are looking up in spite of a recent plunge in prices , experts say . the carbon expo is the only trade fair of its kind which focuses on emissions trading and the reduction of harmful greenhouse gases which cause climate change .
the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .

the event in cologne , which closes on friday , focused on the future of carbon trading : even though the global market increased more than 10 fold from 2004 to 2005 , prices took a plunge of 60 percent recently . there are over 180 exhibitors and the fair attracts thousands of visitors from around 50 countries .
they buy , sell and deal in emissions . dutchman seb walheim , one of many dealers at the fair , said he was enthusiastic about the scheme . " what you have to look at is how much is the market price for co2 , " he said .
" at the moment , the market price for short term co2 is 12 euros -lrb- $ 15.3 -rrb- , for long term co2 about 20 euros .
if you can save co2 for less than that , then you should do so and sell the savings into the market . " market i n te n ded to help cou n tries with kyoto the carbon trading market is simple : each country is allotted a lump-sum amount of emissions which is divided between companies based on their size .
if one country goes over its limit , it has to buy from another which has emitted less than its license .
the carbon market was developed to help countries meet their kyoto protocol goals to reduce the harmful emission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has long refused to sign the kyoto protocol the market was valued at over $ 11 billion -lrb- 8.5 billion euros -rrb- last year , but governments , private sector operators and experts have been expressing concerns about what will happen to the market after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
already the market is starting to get bumpy , said john hay , the head of communications for the united nations climate change secretariat . " at the moment it is going through quite a troubled time and the price of carbon in the european trading market dropped by more than 50 percent within the space of only a couple of weeks , " he said .
" that was due to the over allocation of credits - the countries of the european union awarded too many credits to enterprises and the price went down .
but we are confident that the market will mature and that it is an emerging market and not speculative like the dotcom bubble was . " market works the world bank , a key player in the financing of carbon , is also confident and it predicts that the market will grow even more than it has since coming into effect a year ago .
benoit bousquet of the world bank said the market does work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair wants to help countries reduce emissions and meet kyoto criteria " very large amounts are being traded globally in the project based mechanisms but also , especially in fact in the eupts -lrb- eu pilot trading scheme -rrb- , " he said .
" so if you take that into consideration , and the fact that the price fluctuates quite a bit , it would seem that the market mechanism does work . " and for many european countries , the eupts has enabled them to implement serious policies on reducing emissions for the first time . shaye hoobanoff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

hwang woo-suk was also charged with using millions of dollars in grants for private purposes , as well as violating laws on bio-ethics .
earlier this year dr hwang 's apparently ground-breaking work , such as producing stem cell lines from cloned human embryos , was found to be fake .
prosecutors said that he would not be taken into custody at present .
friday 's announcement marks a new low in the career of the once-famed south korean scientific superstar , who was feted by the nation for his claimed breakthroughs in a promising new medical field .
prosecution official lee in-kyu announced the indictment against dr hwang , as well as charges against five members of his research team , during a nationally televised news conference .
of the other scientists accused , one was indicted for obstruction of duty , three for fraud and one for violation of bio-ethics laws .

"
in november 2004 , our mother anne announced that she had been diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy , an incurable degenerative neurological illness .
as if this were n't enough to take on board at the time , she also announced in the same breath that she planned to end her life , rather than allow her illness to run its natural course .
this was a logical decision for her , as she was a long-standing member of dignity in dying , and had always believed strongly in the right of the individual to opt for an assisted death in these very circumstances .
she had also nursed our father through another degenerative neurological illness and had seen his quality of life erode over a period of years to the extent that , when he died , he was virtually a breathing corpse .
she did not want the same outcome for herself .
suicide attempt our immediate reaction was a combination of enormous grief at the prospect of losing our mother , as we are a very close family , but also of logical acceptance of her course of action . "
if our mother had n't gone to zurich to die , she would have had a miserable existence , waiting for her illness to kill her over a period of months and years . "
edward turner however , in the coming months we tried every possible course of action to distract or dissuade her from carrying out her threat .
we knew we were being selfish , but losing our mother was the worst thing we could imagine .
it was only in october 2005 , after a failed diy suicide attempt at home , that we realised that nothing we could do would stop her from ending her life .
we could either support her in her hour of need , or we could turn our backs on our own mother and let her die a painful death alone .
the latter option was unthinkable to us .
we therefore decided to contact the dignitas clinic in zurich to arrange for an assisted suicide .
once our mother had received the " green light " from dignitas , her whole attitude to life changed .
it was as if a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders , allowing her to enjoy life , without fear as to what the future would bring .
messages of support there were many occasions in the run-up to our trip to switzerland where we shed tears together as a family and where we really questioned our mother 's motivation .
but the final couple of days which we spent together in zurich were surprisingly calm .
we had all said our goodbyes long before , and we felt that there was nothing left unsaid between us , so that we could just focus on the task in hand - supporting our mother and being with her as she died .
if our mother had n't gone to zurich to die , she would have had a miserable existence , waiting for her illness to kill her over a period of months and years .
i am so thankful that she enjoyed her last weeks with us , safe in the knowledge that she would be spared what for her would have been an undignified end .
on our return from switzerland we were swamped with messages of support from everyone : friends and strangers alike .
we realised that we were n't alone and that our mother 's case had struck a chord with the vast majority of the country .
we received not one offensive or unsupportive message .
lord joffe 's bill is very welcome and would give the uk the most advanced assisted dying legislation anywhere in the world - and with the largest number of safeguards .
i agree with the faith groups ' belief that life is to be treasured and celebrated .
but there comes a point in every life-cycle when we must accept that death is logical , timely and kind .
our mother was a very determined and , at times , combative woman .
she felt acutely the injustice of being unable to die in her own country at a time which was right for her , as much as she felt the injustice that she , as a wealthy woman supported by her family , could afford to go to dignitas .
she wanted assisted dying to be available to everyone , not just the well-off .
we can now see clearly that what she did was right for her .
we are so enormously proud of her . "

this was a logical decision for her , as she was a long-standing member of dignity in dying , and had always believed strongly in the right of the individual to opt for an assisted death in these very circumstances .
she had also nursed our father through another degenerative neurological illness and had seen his quality of life erode over a period of years to the extent that , when he died , he was virtually a breathing corpse .
she did not want the same outcome for herself .
suicide attempt our immediate reaction was a combination of enormous grief at the prospect of losing our mother , as we are a very close family , but also of logical acceptance of her course of action .
if our mother had n't gone to zurich to die , she would have had a miserable existence , waiting for her illness to kill her over a period of months and years .
edward turner however , in the coming months we tried every possible course of action to distract or dissuade her from carrying out her threat .
we knew we were being selfish , but losing our mother was the worst thing we could imagine .
it was only in october 2005 , after a failed diy suicide attempt at home , that we realised that nothing we could do would stop her from ending her life .
we could either support her in her hour of need , or we could turn our backs on our own mother and let her die a painful death alone .
the latter option was unthinkable to us .
we therefore decided to contact the dignitas clinic in zurich to arrange for an assisted suicide .
once our mother had received the " green light " from dignitas , her whole attitude to life changed .
it was as if a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders , allowing her to enjoy life , without fear as to what the future would bring .
messages of support there were many occasions in the run-up to our trip to switzerland where we shed tears together as a family and where we really questioned our mother 's motivation .
but the final couple of days which we spent together in zurich were surprisingly calm .
we had all said our goodbyes long before , and we felt that there was nothing left unsaid between us , so that we could just focus on the task in hand - supporting our mother and being with her as she died .
if our mother had n't gone to zurich to die , she would have had a miserable existence , waiting for her illness to kill her over a period of months and years .
i am so thankful that she enjoyed her last weeks with us , safe in the knowledge that she would be spared what for her would have been an undignified end .
on our return from switzerland we were swamped with messages of support from everyone : friends and strangers alike .
we realised that we were n't alone and that our mother 's case had struck a chord with the vast majority of the country .
we received not one offensive or unsupportive message .
lord joffe 's bill is very welcome and would give the uk the most advanced assisted dying legislation anywhere in the world - and with the largest number of safeguards .
i agree with the faith groups ' belief that life is to be treasured and celebrated .
but there comes a point in every life-cycle when we must accept that death is logical , timely and kind .
our mother was a very determined and , at times , combative woman .
she felt acutely the injustice of being unable to die in her own country at a time which was right for her , as much as she felt the injustice that she , as a wealthy woman supported by her family , could afford to go to dignitas .
she wanted assisted dying to be available to everyone , not just the well-off .
we can now see clearly that what she did was right for her .
we are so enormously proud of her .

it 's 18 years since i was diagnosed with the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -lrb- copd -rrb- .
' you have to stay positive ' i have been told i have end stage disease - which means i 'm terminally ill , although i prefer to call it a life-limiting disease .
after all we all start dying from the moment we are born - we just go a different speeds .
i am on oxygen 24 hours a day which is fed through a nasal tube .
at the last count , there are 32 different drugs which keep me alive - it seems that for every drug you take you need two others to control the side-effects .
i am on two types of morphine to control the pain in my lungs when i breathe .
the pain is a bit like having a rat gnawing on my lungs .
the pain is a bit like having a rat gnawing on my lungs .
i also have angina , gout , osteoarthritis , and many allergies .
nonetheless , i feel that life is worth living .
at the end of the day life is what you make it .
it 's not easy , but you have to stay positive .
and if you stay positive then your life extends .
i was told i would n't live till i was 30 but i have .
' i must carry on ' i 've lost count of the number of times i 've been taken into intensive care .
i know that i must carry on , especially for the sake of my two wonderful sons craig and daniel .
friendship is also very important .
i met a wonderful friend called david who has terminal liver cancer through the help the hospices movement .
he 's my soul mate , a buddy , and we help keep each other positive .
' no right to take a life ' i am opposed to the bill on assisted dying for many reasons .
first there is the risk of it being abused .
then there 's the pressure it would put on other people to help kill you .
it 's written in the ten commandments , " thou shalt not kill " and you 've no right to take another person 's life .
then there 's always new medical research .
look at stem cells .
someone you love might kill themselves and then the next day you read there 's a cure and how would you feel then ?
i do get depressed .
i call them my black dog days and i 'm at the bottom .
then i think i have a mum and dad and children and i know i must carry on .
there 's so many things i still want to do .
i have a wish list .
my son daniel composes and plays the piano and we both enjoy musicals .
i 've been to see chitty chitty bang bang but i 'd love to see mary poppins .
there 's still so much to do .

but with fine weather finally reaching much of the uk , hay fever sufferers will have to be on the look out for potentially serious problem .
it 's called the yellow peril , and it 's being blown across the country thanks to our european neighbours .
across the east coast of the uk there have been reports of a fine yellow dust settling on cars .
but weather forecasters today reassured the public that the dust is most probably pollen being blown across from europe .
calls about the " yellow dust " came from people in east yorkshire and lincolnshire as well as from as far inland as west yorkshire and derbyshire .
more pollen means bad news for hay fever sufferers - so this morning we 've put together a guide to preventing the symptoms of hay fever with breakfast 's resident gp dr rosemary leonard and we 've sent our reporter , tim muffett , armed with nasal spray and anti-histamines to grimsby to investigate - find out more at 0720 , 0820 and 0840 dr rosemary 's hay fever advice people tend to rely solely on oral antihistamines , whereas they should also look into using nasal sprays and eye drops stay in when it 's the worst time for pollen - mornings and evenings .
and shut the doors and windows to prevent grass pollen entering the house .
also shut car windows a bit of vaseline on the end of your nose can help as it catches the pollen .
use preventative medical nasal sprays wrap around sunglasses can help as well - ideally curvy ones clothes can catch pollen grains so ideally tumble dry washing during the hay fever season .
if you ca n't do that , hang washing out late morning and take it in before the day cools .
shaking the washing before you go inside can get rid of the pollen .
cover your bed and pillows with a cotton throw to keep pollen off , undress before you enter your bedroom .
pollen can be inhaled from the hair so rinse your hair and skin before going to bed .
pollen clings to dust so can remain active months after the hay fever season has finished .
vacuuming with a powerful vacuum cleaner that is fitted with a hepa filter will help a lot .
-lrb- hepa filter removes 99.9 % of pollen particles from the air -rrb- to reduce wind-dispersed pollen , replacing lawns with patio 's will reduce the amount of grass pollen .
avoid trees such as birch and oak which produce a lot of pollen diet : some hay fever sufferers , esp. those who are sensitive to tree pollens , can also react to fruit during the hay fever season .
symptoms of oral allergy syndrome include a tingly mouth and swollen lips after eating fruits , in particular apples , peaches and plums .
grass pollens come from the same botanical family as sugar and wheat so it makes sense to cut them from your diet .
forecast breakfast 's weather presenter louise lear said that the pollen cloud has probably passed : " the worst is over and the pollen count will drop across the uk because the weather is going to be showery and fresh over the weekend " it 's quite a rare phenomenon in the uk ; we 're unlikely to see it again this summer .

remember : if you have any concerns about your health , you should speak to your gp , a pharmacist will be able to help with the correct over-the-counter treatments for hay fever symptoms e-mail this to a friend printable version bbc news : video and audio tim muffett reports from grimsby in search of the yellow peril coping with hay fever dr rosemary 's advice home about bbc breakfast contact us faqs search breakfast : related bbc links : hay fever : bbc health products & services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts bbc copyright notice mmix most popular now -pipe- 51,043 pages were read in the last minute .

tensions have risen to the surface at the e3 games expo in los angeles , where sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 are vying for attention .
both sides have cast doubt on the other 's sales forecasts .
the xbox 360 went on sale last year while the ps3 is due out in november .
nintendo is planning to offer its new wii system later this year .
sales figures sony is the video games leader , having sold more than 100 million playstation 2s worldwide .
microsoft and nintendo trail far behind . "
i 'll throw back at him that i doubt he can deliver six million units from november to march " peter moore , microsoft but the software giant from seattle is making a determined effort to unseat the current champion .
it became the first of the console giants to release a next-generation system with its xbox 360 .
it aims to have sold more than five million units by the end of june and is hoping to hit 10 million before the ps3 launch .
in an interview with the bbc news website on wednesday , sony 's head of worldwide studios phil harrison shrugged off its rival 's prediction , saying he doubted it would achieve the target .
the comments have promoted a swift response from microsoft , with corporate vice president peter moore challenging sony 's ps3 predictions .
" i 'll throw back at him that i doubt he can deliver six million units from november to march .
i do n't think it is going to happen , " he said .
" the question you have is ' will they be able to meet the demand ? '
" we have learnt that driving demand is fine if you have huge amounts of supply to meet that .
it is not easy to do , " he said .
mr moore is talking from experience .
microsoft suffered huge problems in manufacturing enough xbox 360s to meet demand when the system was launched last year .
two for one when the ps3 arrives in november , a year after the xbox 360 , it will sell for $ 499 in the us .
a premium model will cost $ 599 compared with $ 399 for the high-end model from microsoft , though the ps3 includes a superior-capacity blu-ray dvd drive .
however , microsoft has even suggested the price differential could work in its favour .
mr moore said gamers tended to buy two gaming systems , so they would be able to buy a 360 and a wii for the price of a ps3 .
" xbox 360 is going to be the only place you can play halo 3 and grand theft auto iv on the same platform .
" and you combine that with what nintendo is doing , at what we think is going to be a pretty competitive price point , that is a compelling package . "
japanese troubles despite its head start , microsoft still has to make a significant dent in sony 's home ground .
the xbox 360 received a lukewarm response in japan when it launched there , selling 100,000 units .

tensions have risen to the surface at the e3 games expo in los angeles , where sony 's playstation 3 and microsoft 's xbox 360 are vying for attention .
both sides have cast doubt on the other 's sales forecasts .
the xbox 360 went on sale last year while the ps3 is due out in november .

it aims to have sold more than five million units by the end of june and is hoping to hit 10 million before the ps3 launch .
in an interview with the bbc news website on wednesday , sony 's head of worldwide studios phil harrison shrugged off its rival 's prediction , saying he doubted it would achieve the target .
the comments have promoted a swift response from microsoft , with corporate vice president peter moore challenging sony 's ps3 predictions .
" i 'll throw back at him that i doubt he can deliver six million units from november to march .
i do n't think it is going to happen , " he said .
" the question you have is ' will they be able to meet the demand ? '
" we have learnt that driving demand is fine if you have huge amounts of supply to meet that .

mr moore is talking from experience .
microsoft suffered huge problems in manufacturing enough xbox 360s to meet demand when the system was launched last year .
two for one when the ps3 arrives in november , a year after the xbox 360 , it will sell for $ 499 in the us .
fans were able to play a handful of ps3 games at e3 a premium model will cost $ 599 compared with $ 399 for the high-end model from microsoft , though the ps3 includes a superior-capacity blu-ray dvd drive .
however , microsoft has even suggested the price differential could work in its favour .
mr moore said gamers tended to buy two gaming systems , so they would be able to buy a 360 and a wii for the price of a ps3 .
" xbox 360 is going to be the only place you can play halo 3 and grand theft auto iv on the same platform .
" and you combine that with what nintendo is doing , at what we think is going to be a pretty competitive price point , that is a compelling package . "
japanese troubles despite its head start , microsoft still has to make a significant dent in sony 's home ground .
the xbox 360 received a lukewarm response in japan when it launched there , selling 100,000 units .

the 12-year-old had part of his ear bitten off at upper stanfield street in belfast on thursday .
he was taken to hospital and later discharged .
animal charity , the uspca , said the dog had been voluntarily surrendered to them and had been put down .
uspca chief executive stephen philpott said part of the ear had to be retrieved from the dog 's stomach .
" police contacted us .
they then asked us to try and get that animal to a veterinary surgeon and to get the ear , if it could be retrieved , to the ulster hospital , " he said .
" that procedure was started .
but our officers were stood down when the hospital told us that , in their opinion , that would not be possible .
" we were then told to basically help with an evidence gathering situation and to retrieve any foreign matter from the dog .
that was done last night . "
mr philpott said his officers were stunned at the severity of the attack .
" the society has issued countless warnings on the proliferation of dangerous dogs in our communities and the inevitability of incidents such as this , " he said .
" in some cases we have been ridiculed by the very people charged with administering the dangerous dogs act , however , we can not stand idly by whilst the threat posed to animal welfare and personal safety by dangerous dogs is not being adequately addressed . "
sinn fein assembly member alex maskey said pit bulls can not be kept in residential areas .
" if it had not been for the courageous efforts of a local community worker , i believe that the injuries could have been even more severe , " he said .
it has been illegal to own pit bull terriers in northern ireland since 1976 as they are a proscribed breed under the dangerous dogs act .
however , it is still legal to keep the breed in the republic of ireland .

the 12-year-old had part of his ear bitten off at upper stanfield street in belfast on thursday .
he was taken to hospital and later discharged .

uspca chief executive stephen philpott said part of the ear had to be retrieved from the dog 's stomach .

" that procedure was started .
but our officers were stood down when the hospital told us that , in their opinion , that would not be possible .
" we were then told to basically help with an evidence gathering situation and to retrieve any foreign matter from the dog .
that was done last night . "
mr philpott said his officers were stunned at the severity of the attack .
" the society has issued countless warnings on the proliferation of dangerous dogs in our communities and the inevitability of incidents such as this , " he said .
the boy was out playing in the street when he was attacked " in some cases we have been ridiculed by the very people charged with administering the dangerous dogs act , however , we can not stand idly by whilst the threat posed to animal welfare and personal safety by dangerous dogs is not being adequately addressed . "
sinn fein assembly member alex maskey said pit bulls can not be kept in residential areas .
