there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.10.2006 neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town rallied together to prevent the sale to neo-nazis the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .
the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement .

" that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.10.2006 neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town rallied together to prevent the sale to neo-nazis the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .
the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern .

" that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .

" that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

8 a crucial report on the country 's progress towards eu membership .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to begin a state visit to ankara on thursday . " i want to make sure that the first anniversary -lrb- of the accession talks -rrb- is not the last one , " rehn told a news conference .
" i want to work for avoiding a train crash in turkey-eu relations . " highlighting the benefits of turkey 's eu membership , the enlargement commissioner said it would ease mounting tensions between the west and muslim countries if turkey carries out the necessary reforms and meets all eu criteria . " in the current situation when ... relations between europe and islam is the greatest challenge of our time , it simply wo n't make sense to allow the things to lead to a train crash , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn urged turkey to get rid of its infamous article 301 rehn urged ankara to pass reforms to ensure freedom of speech , a major area of concern after dozens of intellectuals were charged with denigrating the turkish nation under a penal code article , and to grant trade privileges to cyprus under a customs union agreement . "
insulting turkishness " " freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our common democratic values .
i can not even imagine a member of the eu that will not respect such a fundamental european principle , " rehn said earlier at a conference on trade union rights . a string of intellectuals , including best-selling writers orhan pamuk and elif shafak , have stood trial under article 301 of the penal code , which envisages up to three years in jail for insulting " turkishness " and state institutions .
no one has yet been imprisoned under the provision , but the appeals court in july upheld the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting an alarming precedent for pending cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicek has rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said he is open to proposals to amend the article , but no action has been taken so far amid vocal opposition by nationalist-minded justice minister cemil cicek . speaking after talks with rehn , cicek rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 before the crucial nov .
8 report , arguing that " parliament is not under the government 's command , " and that an upsurge in kurdish rebel violence this year was making it harder for ankara to expand freedoms . he also charged that freedom of speech was being breached in eu countries , pointing to a french draft law that would make it a punishable offense to deny that the massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire amounted to genocide . " while asking why freedom of expression is being restricted in turkey , one can not turn a blind eye to a draft law that will be taken up on october 12 in an eu country , " he said .
search for cyprus solution on the row over cyprus , rehn said he was hopeful that a formula proposed by the eu 's finnish presidency would resolve the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't allow cypriot boats into its harbors turkey is under pressure to open its air and sea ports to the internationally recognized cyprus government under a customs union agreement with the eu , or face a suspension of its membership talks . ankara insists that cypriot ships and planes will remain barred from turkish ports unless the eu delivers on its promise to ease trade restrictions on the island 's breakaway turkish cypriot state , recognized only by turkey . " the finnish formula has not been rejected by any of the parties so far , including turkey , " rehn said .
" i trust all parties sense the seriousness of the issue and try their best to find a solution . "
civilian control he also called on ankara to improve the rights of women and non-muslim religious communities as " other very important issues of urgency . " in another sticking point , rehn urged the government to keep up reforms to strengthen civilian control over the influential turkish military " like in any european democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's military still has too much power , rehn suggested on monday , chief of staff yasar buyukanit angrily rejected eu criticism of its influence in politics , saying that the charges had exceeded " the limits of tolerance , " and asserted the army 's right to have a say on issues concerning national security and the protection of turkey 's strictly secular system . rehn was scheduled to meet with erdogan , foreign minister abdullah gul as well as other officials before he wraps up his visit thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author cleared in trial , eu keeps up pressure a turkish court has acquitted author elif shafak in a trial over a book about the massacres of armenians during world war i , saving the government from fresh embarrassment in its ties to the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it .

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .
otherwise , the european flight of fancy will end with a crash landing . henrik böhme is a business correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

it is volkswagen 's clear objective not only to guard these interests , but also to strengthen the potential .

program guide programs arts.21 video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv latinoamerica : arts.21 arts.21 -pipe- 04.10.2006 mysterious anachronism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the painter neo rauch the celebrated artists neo rauch on the power of images , the art market and leipzig .
an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .

india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club . " of turkey 's peers in europe , france and italy - both large exporters - scored poorly , " ti said .
" isolating answers from african respondents places italy and france in the bottom six countries overall . " good marks the bribery payers index -lrb- bpi -rrb- was compiled based on the responses of some 11,000 business people in 125 countries to a world economic forum survey this year . the country thought least likely to offer bribes abroad was switzerland , followed by sweden , australia , austria , canada and britain .
the united states was not far behind in ninth place , tying with belgium . germany fared relatively well in the survey , coming in seventh place - despite the controversy surrounding german-american motor company daimlerchrysler 's recent admission to paying bribes in africa , asia and eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary ludwig-holger pfahls was convicted of bribery in a tank deal with saudi arabia " we saw that germany fared pretty well given the fact that it has three times as many opportunities to bribe , " hans-jörg elshorst , head of ti 's german branch , told dw-radio .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 04.10.2006 study : switzerland tops in preventing bribery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bribery is now harder to conceal " transparency international released a study on wednesday showing that switzerland is the most effective among the world 's leading exporting nations in preventing its firms from bribing .
india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club . " of turkey 's peers in europe , france and italy - both large exporters - scored poorly , " ti said .
" isolating answers from african respondents places italy and france in the bottom six countries overall . " good marks the bribery payers index -lrb- bpi -rrb- was compiled based on the responses of some 11,000 business people in 125 countries to a world economic forum survey this year . the country thought least likely to offer bribes abroad was switzerland , followed by sweden , australia , austria , canada and britain .
the united states was not far behind in ninth place , tying with belgium . germany fared relatively well in the survey , coming in seventh place - despite the controversy surrounding german-american motor company daimlerchrysler 's recent admission to paying bribes in africa , asia and eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary ludwig-holger pfahls was convicted of bribery in a tank deal with saudi arabia " we saw that germany fared pretty well given the fact that it has three times as many opportunities to bribe , " hans-jörg elshorst , head of ti 's german branch , told dw-radio .
" it is the world champion of exports , but thankfully , is not a champion of corruption . " rating is relative however , no country was able to completely prevent its companies from making improper payments .
elshorst said that there was very little that actually separates the best performers from the worst on the index . " there are different levels , but even the first and the last - switzerland and india - are pretty close together , " he said .
" the difference is just three points of 10 possible points . " on a scale from 10 , for no corruption , down to 1 , for vast corruption , switzerland scored 7.81 while india scored 4.62 . profiteering from development money to cut down on the bribery practice , ti recommended that wealthy oecd countries step up enforcement of the organization 's anti-bribery convention .
it urged development banks to debar companies found guilty of bribery abroad .
the organization also encouraged china , india and russia to sign on to the convention voluntarily . " it is hypocritical that oecd-based companies continue to bribe across the globe , while their governments pay lip service to enforcing the law , " said ti 's chief executive , david nussbaum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the watchdog agency tries to uncover corruption worldwide foreign companies that commit the crime of bribery were undercutting africa 's anti-poverty efforts , according to casey kelso , ti 's regional director for africa .
he pointed to crooked companies that profiteered from development money and called on african governments to prosecute them vigorously . " progress made " despite these warnings , elshorst was upbeat about progress that has been made in fighting corruption . " when you look back 10 or 15 years ago , bribery was widely accepted , even in our country , " he said .
" you had the privilege of deducting your bribes from your taxes . " elshorst said that people used to see that as an official endorsement of bribery by the state . " that 's now over , " he said .
" companies try really hard to avoid it or at least to conceal it , and trying to conceal it is difficult .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .

why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .

the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness .

there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?

india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club . " of turkey 's peers in europe , france and italy - both large exporters - scored poorly , " ti said .
" isolating answers from african respondents places italy and france in the bottom six countries overall . " good marks the bribery payers index -lrb- bpi -rrb- was compiled based on the responses of some 11,000 business people in 125 countries to a world economic forum survey this year . the country thought least likely to offer bribes abroad was switzerland , followed by sweden , australia , austria , canada and britain .
the united states was not far behind in ninth place , tying with belgium . germany fared relatively well in the survey , coming in seventh place - despite the controversy surrounding german-american motor company daimlerchrysler 's recent admission to paying bribes in africa , asia and eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary ludwig-holger pfahls was convicted of bribery in a tank deal with saudi arabia " we saw that germany fared pretty well given the fact that it has three times as many opportunities to bribe , " hans-jörg elshorst , head of ti 's german branch , told dw-radio .
" it is the world champion of exports , but thankfully , is not a champion of corruption . " rating is relative however , no country was able to completely prevent its companies from making improper payments .
elshorst said that there was very little that actually separates the best performers from the worst on the index . " there are different levels , but even the first and the last - switzerland and india - are pretty close together , " he said .
" the difference is just three points of 10 possible points . " on a scale from 10 , for no corruption , down to 1 , for vast corruption , switzerland scored 7.81 while india scored 4.62 . profiteering from development money to cut down on the bribery practice , ti recommended that wealthy oecd countries step up enforcement of the organization 's anti-bribery convention .
it urged development banks to debar companies found guilty of bribery abroad .
the organization also encouraged china , india and russia to sign on to the convention voluntarily . " it is hypocritical that oecd-based companies continue to bribe across the globe , while their governments pay lip service to enforcing the law , " said ti 's chief executive , david nussbaum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the watchdog agency tries to uncover corruption worldwide foreign companies that commit the crime of bribery were undercutting africa 's anti-poverty efforts , according to casey kelso , ti 's regional director for africa .
he pointed to crooked companies that profiteered from development money and called on african governments to prosecute them vigorously . " progress made " despite these warnings , elshorst was upbeat about progress that has been made in fighting corruption . " when you look back 10 or 15 years ago , bribery was widely accepted , even in our country , " he said .
" you had the privilege of deducting your bribes from your taxes . " elshorst said that people used to see that as an official endorsement of bribery by the state . " that 's now over , " he said .

8 a crucial report on the country 's progress towards eu membership .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to begin a state visit to ankara on thursday . " i want to make sure that the first anniversary -lrb- of the accession talks -rrb- is not the last one , " rehn told a news conference .
" i want to work for avoiding a train crash in turkey-eu relations . " highlighting the benefits of turkey 's eu membership , the enlargement commissioner said it would ease mounting tensions between the west and muslim countries if turkey carries out the necessary reforms and meets all eu criteria . " in the current situation when ... relations between europe and islam is the greatest challenge of our time , it simply wo n't make sense to allow the things to lead to a train crash , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn urged turkey to get rid of its infamous article 301 rehn urged ankara to pass reforms to ensure freedom of speech , a major area of concern after dozens of intellectuals were charged with denigrating the turkish nation under a penal code article , and to grant trade privileges to cyprus under a customs union agreement . "
insulting turkishness " " freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our common democratic values .
i can not even imagine a member of the eu that will not respect such a fundamental european principle , " rehn said earlier at a conference on trade union rights . a string of intellectuals , including best-selling writers orhan pamuk and elif shafak , have stood trial under article 301 of the penal code , which envisages up to three years in jail for insulting " turkishness " and state institutions .
no one has yet been imprisoned under the provision , but the appeals court in july upheld the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting an alarming precedent for pending cases .

8 report , arguing that " parliament is not under the government 's command , " and that an upsurge in kurdish rebel violence this year was making it harder for ankara to expand freedoms . he also charged that freedom of speech was being breached in eu countries , pointing to a french draft law that would make it a punishable offense to deny that the massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire amounted to genocide . " while asking why freedom of expression is being restricted in turkey , one can not turn a blind eye to a draft law that will be taken up on october 12 in an eu country , " he said .
search for cyprus solution on the row over cyprus , rehn said he was hopeful that a formula proposed by the eu 's finnish presidency would resolve the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't allow cypriot boats into its harbors turkey is under pressure to open its air and sea ports to the internationally recognized cyprus government under a customs union agreement with the eu , or face a suspension of its membership talks . ankara insists that cypriot ships and planes will remain barred from turkish ports unless the eu delivers on its promise to ease trade restrictions on the island 's breakaway turkish cypriot state , recognized only by turkey . " the finnish formula has not been rejected by any of the parties so far , including turkey , " rehn said .
" i trust all parties sense the seriousness of the issue and try their best to find a solution . "
civilian control he also called on ankara to improve the rights of women and non-muslim religious communities as " other very important issues of urgency . " in another sticking point , rehn urged the government to keep up reforms to strengthen civilian control over the influential turkish military " like in any european democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's military still has too much power , rehn suggested on monday , chief of staff yasar buyukanit angrily rejected eu criticism of its influence in politics , saying that the charges had exceeded " the limits of tolerance , " and asserted the army 's right to have a say on issues concerning national security and the protection of turkey 's strictly secular system . rehn was scheduled to meet with erdogan , foreign minister abdullah gul as well as other officials before he wraps up his visit thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author cleared in trial , eu keeps up pressure a turkish court has acquitted author elif shafak in a trial over a book about the massacres of armenians during world war i , saving the government from fresh embarrassment in its ties to the european union .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .

top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .

but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .

there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .

was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club . " of turkey 's peers in europe , france and italy - both large exporters - scored poorly , " ti said .
" isolating answers from african respondents places italy and france in the bottom six countries overall . " good marks the bribery payers index -lrb- bpi -rrb- was compiled based on the responses of some 11,000 business people in 125 countries to a world economic forum survey this year . the country thought least likely to offer bribes abroad was switzerland , followed by sweden , australia , austria , canada and britain .
the united states was not far behind in ninth place , tying with belgium . germany fared relatively well in the survey , coming in seventh place - despite the controversy surrounding german-american motor company daimlerchrysler 's recent admission to paying bribes in africa , asia and eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary ludwig-holger pfahls was convicted of bribery in a tank deal with saudi arabia " we saw that germany fared pretty well given the fact that it has three times as many opportunities to bribe , " hans-jörg elshorst , head of ti 's german branch , told dw-radio .
" it is the world champion of exports , but thankfully , is not a champion of corruption . " rating is relative however , no country was able to completely prevent its companies from making improper payments .
elshorst said that there was very little that actually separates the best performers from the worst on the index . " there are different levels , but even the first and the last - switzerland and india - are pretty close together , " he said .
" the difference is just three points of 10 possible points . " on a scale from 10 , for no corruption , down to 1 , for vast corruption , switzerland scored 7.81 while india scored 4.62 . profiteering from development money to cut down on the bribery practice , ti recommended that wealthy oecd countries step up enforcement of the organization 's anti-bribery convention .
it urged development banks to debar companies found guilty of bribery abroad .
the organization also encouraged china , india and russia to sign on to the convention voluntarily . " it is hypocritical that oecd-based companies continue to bribe across the globe , while their governments pay lip service to enforcing the law , " said ti 's chief executive , david nussbaum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the watchdog agency tries to uncover corruption worldwide foreign companies that commit the crime of bribery were undercutting africa 's anti-poverty efforts , according to casey kelso , ti 's regional director for africa .
he pointed to crooked companies that profiteered from development money and called on african governments to prosecute them vigorously . " progress made " despite these warnings , elshorst was upbeat about progress that has been made in fighting corruption . " when you look back 10 or 15 years ago , bribery was widely accepted , even in our country , " he said .
" you had the privilege of deducting your bribes from your taxes . " elshorst said that people used to see that as an official endorsement of bribery by the state . " that 's now over , " he said .
" companies try really hard to avoid it or at least to conceal it , and trying to conceal it is difficult .

there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .

at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .

but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .

rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.10.2006 neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the town rallied together to prevent the sale to neo-nazis the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .
the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?

"
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.10.2006 german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could move its hamburg operations to a cheaper location outside of germany plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm . news that airbus is facing an uncertain future due to the delayed roll-out of the a380 super jumbo jet by at least a year , and the proposed shifting of operations from hamburg to cheaper sites in russia , india and china , has angered politicians and industry officials in germany . politicians in hamburg , home of the airbus plant charged with building the super jumbo 's cabins , are reportedly enraged at prospects of layoffs after the german state spent 750 million euros -lrb- $ 955 million -rrb- to keep the plant running . airbus is responsible for some 40,000 jobs in germany .
berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- more delays ahead for airbus a380 super jumbo jet europe 's largest aerospace group eads warned of new delays in deliveries of its airbus a380 super jumbo airliner thursday , implying a second big setback for the group in three months .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

india came in last in the study . the corruption watchdog organization transparency international 's " bribe payers index 2006 " showed that companies in turkey have one of the world 's worst reputations for paying bribes abroad , while firms in france and italy are notorious for the practice in africa . in the 2006 index ranking , transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- placed turkey as the fourth worst in the perceived tendency of companies in the world 's 30 leading export nations to pay foreign bribes .
turkey came just ahead of russia , china and india in the index . " this is a crucial result as the country pursues its bid for european union membership , " ti said in a statement in brussels . " the poor score also raises troubling questions about the commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- anti-bribery convention , which entered into force there in 2003 , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two turkish government officials were caught several years ago bargaining for kickbacks turkey began membership talks with the eu a year ago but was told that the process would take at least a decade to complete , with no guarantees at the end that it would actually be allowed into the european club . " of turkey 's peers in europe , france and italy - both large exporters - scored poorly , " ti said .
" isolating answers from african respondents places italy and france in the bottom six countries overall . " good marks the bribery payers index -lrb- bpi -rrb- was compiled based on the responses of some 11,000 business people in 125 countries to a world economic forum survey this year . the country thought least likely to offer bribes abroad was switzerland , followed by sweden , australia , austria , canada and britain .
the united states was not far behind in ninth place , tying with belgium . germany fared relatively well in the survey , coming in seventh place - despite the controversy surrounding german-american motor company daimlerchrysler 's recent admission to paying bribes in africa , asia and eastern europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary ludwig-holger pfahls was convicted of bribery in a tank deal with saudi arabia " we saw that germany fared pretty well given the fact that it has three times as many opportunities to bribe , " hans-jörg elshorst , head of ti 's german branch , told dw-radio .
" it is the world champion of exports , but thankfully , is not a champion of corruption . " rating is relative however , no country was able to completely prevent its companies from making improper payments .
elshorst said that there was very little that actually separates the best performers from the worst on the index . " there are different levels , but even the first and the last - switzerland and india - are pretty close together , " he said .
" the difference is just three points of 10 possible points . " on a scale from 10 , for no corruption , down to 1 , for vast corruption , switzerland scored 7.81 while india scored 4.62 . profiteering from development money to cut down on the bribery practice , ti recommended that wealthy oecd countries step up enforcement of the organization 's anti-bribery convention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.10.2006 german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could move its hamburg operations to a cheaper location outside of germany plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm . news that airbus is facing an uncertain future due to the delayed roll-out of the a380 super jumbo jet by at least a year , and the proposed shifting of operations from hamburg to cheaper sites in russia , india and china , has angered politicians and industry officials in germany . politicians in hamburg , home of the airbus plant charged with building the super jumbo 's cabins , are reportedly enraged at prospects of layoffs after the german state spent 750 million euros -lrb- $ 955 million -rrb- to keep the plant running . airbus is responsible for some 40,000 jobs in germany .
berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2006 " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu aspirations are likely to be at the top of the agenda when merkel meets erdogan chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .

that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .

carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .
otherwise , the european flight of fancy will end with a crash landing . henrik böhme is a business correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- more delays ahead for airbus a380 super jumbo jet europe 's largest aerospace group eads warned of new delays in deliveries of its airbus a380 super jumbo airliner thursday , implying a second big setback for the group in three months .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

8 a crucial report on the country 's progress towards eu membership .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to begin a state visit to ankara on thursday . " i want to make sure that the first anniversary -lrb- of the accession talks -rrb- is not the last one , " rehn told a news conference .
" i want to work for avoiding a train crash in turkey-eu relations . " highlighting the benefits of turkey 's eu membership , the enlargement commissioner said it would ease mounting tensions between the west and muslim countries if turkey carries out the necessary reforms and meets all eu criteria . " in the current situation when ... relations between europe and islam is the greatest challenge of our time , it simply wo n't make sense to allow the things to lead to a train crash , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn urged turkey to get rid of its infamous article 301 rehn urged ankara to pass reforms to ensure freedom of speech , a major area of concern after dozens of intellectuals were charged with denigrating the turkish nation under a penal code article , and to grant trade privileges to cyprus under a customs union agreement . "
insulting turkishness " " freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our common democratic values .
i can not even imagine a member of the eu that will not respect such a fundamental european principle , " rehn said earlier at a conference on trade union rights . a string of intellectuals , including best-selling writers orhan pamuk and elif shafak , have stood trial under article 301 of the penal code , which envisages up to three years in jail for insulting " turkishness " and state institutions .
no one has yet been imprisoned under the provision , but the appeals court in july upheld the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting an alarming precedent for pending cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicek has rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said he is open to proposals to amend the article , but no action has been taken so far amid vocal opposition by nationalist-minded justice minister cemil cicek . speaking after talks with rehn , cicek rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 before the crucial nov .
8 report , arguing that " parliament is not under the government 's command , " and that an upsurge in kurdish rebel violence this year was making it harder for ankara to expand freedoms . he also charged that freedom of speech was being breached in eu countries , pointing to a french draft law that would make it a punishable offense to deny that the massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire amounted to genocide . " while asking why freedom of expression is being restricted in turkey , one can not turn a blind eye to a draft law that will be taken up on october 12 in an eu country , " he said .
search for cyprus solution on the row over cyprus , rehn said he was hopeful that a formula proposed by the eu 's finnish presidency would resolve the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't allow cypriot boats into its harbors turkey is under pressure to open its air and sea ports to the internationally recognized cyprus government under a customs union agreement with the eu , or face a suspension of its membership talks . ankara insists that cypriot ships and planes will remain barred from turkish ports unless the eu delivers on its promise to ease trade restrictions on the island 's breakaway turkish cypriot state , recognized only by turkey . " the finnish formula has not been rejected by any of the parties so far , including turkey , " rehn said .
" i trust all parties sense the seriousness of the issue and try their best to find a solution . "
civilian control he also called on ankara to improve the rights of women and non-muslim religious communities as " other very important issues of urgency . " in another sticking point , rehn urged the government to keep up reforms to strengthen civilian control over the influential turkish military " like in any european democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's military still has too much power , rehn suggested on monday , chief of staff yasar buyukanit angrily rejected eu criticism of its influence in politics , saying that the charges had exceeded " the limits of tolerance , " and asserted the army 's right to have a say on issues concerning national security and the protection of turkey 's strictly secular system . rehn was scheduled to meet with erdogan , foreign minister abdullah gul as well as other officials before he wraps up his visit thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author cleared in trial , eu keeps up pressure a turkish court has acquitted author elif shafak in a trial over a book about the massacres of armenians during world war i , saving the government from fresh embarrassment in its ties to the european union .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

" the investment -lrb- in man -rrb- should allow volkswagen to secure its strategic interest in the truck sector and should make possible a friendly and jointly developed solution , which achieves maximum synergies , " volkswagen said in a statement . man launched a hostile takeover worth 9.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- last month for scania , in which vw holds 34 percent of the voting rights , seeking to create the biggest european truck manufacturer and the third-biggest in the world . shares in man plunged 6.88 percent to 68.91 euros on the frankfurt stock exchange in early afternoon trading , while vw shares showed a gain of 1.87 percent to 69.25 euros . in sweden , scania b shares gained 1.19 percent to 341.50 kronor .

it is volkswagen 's clear objective not only to guard these interests , but also to strengthen the potential . " volkswagen said it had acquired the shares in man through the stock market . man issued a statement saying it welcomed the step .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- more delays ahead for airbus a380 super jumbo jet europe 's largest aerospace group eads warned of new delays in deliveries of its airbus a380 super jumbo airliner thursday , implying a second big setback for the group in three months .
-lrb- 21.09.2006 -rrb- superjumbo 's delays spell bosses ' demise the french co-chief executive of eads , noel forgeard , and the german chief of european aircraft manufacturer airbus , gustav humbert , resigned on sunday , the european aerospace company said in a statement .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .
this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .
giving the neo-nazi 's the hotel would have effectively cut the town council and inhabitants out of the running to purchase the hotel . neo-nazi 's all but out of the running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis look to have turned their backs on the hotel the decision on the hotel 's future is expected to be made on thursday , with the local council meeting to discuss its fate .
mergel hopes that his hotel will be sold to the council for around 3 million euros , though the property is still available on internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros . jürgen rieger , who has defended a number of neo-nazis , including holocaust denier ernst zündel , and is known for speaking at neo-nazi rallies honoring hitler 's deputy rudolf hess , remained silent on the deal as the deadline approached . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de city scours law books to keep hotel from going to neo-nazis the town of delmenhorst is united : they do n't want a neo-nazi to buy a local hotel as a meeting place for right-extremists .

this effectively ends its plan to take over the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst , much to the relief of the town 's citizens . delmenhorst citizens fight back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi lawyer jürgen rieger and his far-right clients have fallen silent on the hotel deal when the inhabitants of the town heard that the neo-nazi rieger and his clients were looking to buy their hotel , they staged a number of protests and organized a fund to raise money to buy the property themselves . before wednesday 's news that the deal was effectively off , the townspeople had raised 900,000 euros - not enough to secure its future without extremist involvement . then they were faced with the prospect of the hotel falling into the neo-nazis ' hands regardless of whether they came up with the full amount when the owner announced that he would give the far-right the property as a " donation " in return for the foundation taking over his debts and paying the " gift tax " legally required for such a large donation .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

the group is unlikely to make an offer by thursday 's deadline . the attempted purchase of the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst by a neo-nazi group appears to have fallen through after the hotel 's owner revealed that there was no longer any contact with the group 's hamburg-based lawyer , jürgen rieger , and that the proposed deal would not go through . günter mergel told german public broadcaster ard 's tagesschau.de news site that rieger 's 3.4 million euro -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- offer for his hotel was no longer on the table . since the lawyer announced at the beginning of september that the acquisition would soon go through , the lines of communication have gone dead . even the lawyer 's clients , the wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd , a mysterious group registered in london that promotes racial purity , seem to have vanished into thin air . british company register wipes far-right foundation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi target : the hotel am stadtpark in delmenhorst the organization , which was named after its shadowy benefactor , a rich nazi from bremen , has been wiped off the british commercial register .
rieger admitted in september that there had been some tax problems with the foundation , but he knew nothing at the time of any possible deletion from the register , he said . this was contrary to the fact that the company had for some time been noted on an internet list of businesses worldwide that were facing closure and deletion .
the reasons given were the lack of any tax receipts from 2004 , which should have been submitted by a deadline that expired at the end of last year . what happens to the company now is unclear .
the british state can take possession of the foundation 's offices in kensington , london , and any other properties that it owns , including a number of estates in germany .
however , if rieger registers the foundation as a limited company , he could legally take over the offices and retain the properties in germany . but with such outstanding taxes , it looks as though the foundation will have to reinvent itself more thoroughly than that to avoid prosecution .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .

an exclusive arts.21 interview . neo rauch is one of germany 's most successful contemporary painters .
now he ’ s just opened a sensational solo exhibition in leipzig where he lives and works .
since 2005 rauch has also been teaching as professor at leipzig ’ s famous art academy .
for the new exhibition neo rauch produced twelve large-format oil paintings devoted to the theme of time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the opening in september thousands of visitors came to the gallery eigen + art and many of them were from overseas .
" i have already had offers for all twelve pictures , from private collectors as well as from museums . " announced gallery owner judy lybke at the opening party while the first guests were milling around wide-eyed , trying to decipher the enormous dreamscapes .
collectors and museums pay up to a quarter of a million euros for a work by rauch .
rainer traube , head of dw-tv arts and culture was able to meet this media-shy artist in leipzig to talk about his mysteriously anachronistic work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : is neo rauch a storyteller ?
neo rauch : yes , of course .
i do see myself as a storyteller .
my pictures are obviously structured narratives , and for me they are very clear .
for me , everything is very clear when i stand in front of my paintings .
sometimes i even ask myself if they are n't a bit too clear .
perhaps i should retreat back into my shell ?
but then i ’ m brought back to reality when i ’ m confronted with reactions like yours .
obviously my work isn ’ t as easy to read as i think .
but i still believe that it can be interpreted to a certain extent , but always with a remainder that can not be named or explained , which is essential for a work of art .
so you do want to be deciphered ?
yes , but i don ’ t want to churn out an extension of newscasts with other means .
i do n't want to do journalism nor do i want to be the uncle telling fairy tales .
you once described the act of painting as " standing in front of a canvas as if it were a fogbank " .
what happens then ?
yes , it really can feel like that .
you are an instrument of something different .
as if something works through me .
in my own way , i take in the world through myself .
it all comes out at the tip of my brush , and reappears in a transformed manner .
but this isn ’ t an everyday experience .
perhaps it ’ s best described as a kind of chess game you against yourself .
the starting-point is very clear .
before i can begin i have to look at the various positions ; i have to work out what the basic constellation is .
and as soon as that 's clear , i can begin .
from that point on i 'm really just a painter .
i am only acting as a sleepwalking director in my own private theatre .
it ’ s almost as being under the influence of drugs .
your pictures are mainly peopled with male figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , i have been trying my best to correct that balance , but i am still more at home with my own sex .
i have the benefit of first-hand experience of the fears , fallacies , worries and anguish that men go through .
so essentially these are all self-portraits .
women appear more as a counterpoint , as healers , wise women , goddesses and angels .
americans in particular find your pictures very german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i ’ ve had american gallery owners coming up to me and ask : " what gives with you over there , why are you all trying so hard to be american ?
we ’ ve got enough of that here ! "
this scrambling to keep up , to appear cosmopolitan , has the downside that it leads to a lot of commonplace art .
i haven ’ t made a conscious decision to go against this ; all i ’ ve done is to continue doing my own thing .
suddenly i found that i was being perceived in a different way , as someone set apart from those who are just trying to keep in touch .
" pop-art with an east-german accent " is how one american critic described it .
people only say that because they know i was born in the east .
if the pictures had been painted in belgium or london , no one would ever think of giving them this label .
it ’ s what people like to say who believe that i am still bound up in what i have experienced in those tortured times .
all i can say is that they are wrong .
but you are regarded as the founder of the new leipzig school and as its most successful representative ...
that really touches a sore point , because i have found that the very young painters , my students , are really suffering under this category .
and those in-between have also got sick and tired of this pigeon-holing .
i personally have always thought it rather silly .
of course it ’ s great to have a buzzword , an easy way to package a phenomenon .
but the only thing that connects all our various positions is our commitment to painting .
are you interested in the boom in the art market , all this talk about stars , prices and art fairs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i try to keep all this as far away as possible from my own life .
it ’ s so obvious that this is an overheated machine running out of control .
the bursting of the bubble that friends and enemies are both anticipating and fearing might take a while .
we have quite successfully tried to keep a lid on prices , to not let them soar to the regions that some of my colleagues have been pushed to .
my output is manageable : i can only paint around 20 pictures a year .
but is getting difficult for the up-and-coming artists .
if you haven ’ t even graduated and are already being sold for breath taking sums in new york galleries .
people actually believe that these raw works can be used as cash cows .
some of them are in for a big disappointment when things start to go downhill .
you don ’ t like talking about the prices of your pictures ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism is always focussed on the painters , which is rather strange where do i stand with my prices ?
now i 'll talk about it , although it really belongs on the financial pages .
the topic disgusts me .
but look at damien hirst or andreas gursky and so forth .
in their case no one has a problem with it , it ’ s accepted as a fact , even applauded .
but with painters , you are questioned critically : how has it come to this ?
what do you think about it ?
can you deal with it ?
does painting have any power left in this world that is inundated with images ?
of course really depends of its substance .
painting has the power to hit the general chaos of information overkill and opulence of misery like a meteorite .
it can also work its way subversively swimming with the stream while creating spaces from the inside where intellect finds room to breathe .
this is what drives you to keep on going back to the canvas .
this yearning for paintings that no one else is providing - so i have to do it myself .
this is my understanding of art .
it is without intention , like a natural phenomenon that can not possibly brooded out in dry cerebral recesses .

8 a crucial report on the country 's progress towards eu membership .
german chancellor angela merkel is due to begin a state visit to ankara on thursday . " i want to make sure that the first anniversary -lrb- of the accession talks -rrb- is not the last one , " rehn told a news conference .
" i want to work for avoiding a train crash in turkey-eu relations . " highlighting the benefits of turkey 's eu membership , the enlargement commissioner said it would ease mounting tensions between the west and muslim countries if turkey carries out the necessary reforms and meets all eu criteria . " in the current situation when ... relations between europe and islam is the greatest challenge of our time , it simply wo n't make sense to allow the things to lead to a train crash , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn urged turkey to get rid of its infamous article 301 rehn urged ankara to pass reforms to ensure freedom of speech , a major area of concern after dozens of intellectuals were charged with denigrating the turkish nation under a penal code article , and to grant trade privileges to cyprus under a customs union agreement . "
insulting turkishness " " freedom of expression is a cornerstone of our common democratic values .
i can not even imagine a member of the eu that will not respect such a fundamental european principle , " rehn said earlier at a conference on trade union rights . a string of intellectuals , including best-selling writers orhan pamuk and elif shafak , have stood trial under article 301 of the penal code , which envisages up to three years in jail for insulting " turkishness " and state institutions .
no one has yet been imprisoned under the provision , but the appeals court in july upheld the suspended six-month sentence of a turkish-armenian journalist , setting an alarming precedent for pending cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicek has rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has said he is open to proposals to amend the article , but no action has been taken so far amid vocal opposition by nationalist-minded justice minister cemil cicek . speaking after talks with rehn , cicek rejected eu pressure to amend article 301 before the crucial nov .
8 report , arguing that " parliament is not under the government 's command , " and that an upsurge in kurdish rebel violence this year was making it harder for ankara to expand freedoms . he also charged that freedom of speech was being breached in eu countries , pointing to a french draft law that would make it a punishable offense to deny that the massacres of armenians under the ottoman empire amounted to genocide . " while asking why freedom of expression is being restricted in turkey , one can not turn a blind eye to a draft law that will be taken up on october 12 in an eu country , " he said .
search for cyprus solution on the row over cyprus , rehn said he was hopeful that a formula proposed by the eu 's finnish presidency would resolve the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey does n't allow cypriot boats into its harbors turkey is under pressure to open its air and sea ports to the internationally recognized cyprus government under a customs union agreement with the eu , or face a suspension of its membership talks . ankara insists that cypriot ships and planes will remain barred from turkish ports unless the eu delivers on its promise to ease trade restrictions on the island 's breakaway turkish cypriot state , recognized only by turkey . " the finnish formula has not been rejected by any of the parties so far , including turkey , " rehn said .
" i trust all parties sense the seriousness of the issue and try their best to find a solution . "
civilian control he also called on ankara to improve the rights of women and non-muslim religious communities as " other very important issues of urgency . " in another sticking point , rehn urged the government to keep up reforms to strengthen civilian control over the influential turkish military " like in any european democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's military still has too much power , rehn suggested on monday , chief of staff yasar buyukanit angrily rejected eu criticism of its influence in politics , saying that the charges had exceeded " the limits of tolerance , " and asserted the army 's right to have a say on issues concerning national security and the protection of turkey 's strictly secular system . rehn was scheduled to meet with erdogan , foreign minister abdullah gul as well as other officials before he wraps up his visit thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish author cleared in trial , eu keeps up pressure a turkish court has acquitted author elif shafak in a trial over a book about the massacres of armenians during world war i , saving the government from fresh embarrassment in its ties to the european union .

berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .
otherwise , the european flight of fancy will end with a crash landing . henrik böhme is a business correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .
otherwise , the european flight of fancy will end with a crash landing . henrik böhme is a business correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- more delays ahead for airbus a380 super jumbo jet europe 's largest aerospace group eads warned of new delays in deliveries of its airbus a380 super jumbo airliner thursday , implying a second big setback for the group in three months .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe . soner cagaptay is the director of the turkish research program at the washington institute for near east policy .
he has taught courses on the middle east at yale and princeton and is currently also a professor at the bmw center for german and european studies at georgetown university . dw-world.de : the united states has always been a strong advocate of turkey joining the european union .
europe agreed to formally begin accession talks a year ago , but the tide of public opinion , especially in germany and france , is against turkey .
at best , europeans view the us as meddling in eu internal affairs , since the decision to admit turkey is up to all 25 , soon to be 27 members -lrb- bulgaria and romania are set to join in 2007 -rrb- .
why should turkey 's status in europe matter to the americans ? soner cagaptay : regardless of what european leaders and bureaucrats say publicly about internal meddling , us support for turkey does make an enormous difference behind closed doors .
without american support , turkey would not be where it is today ; it would have never reached the point of starting accession talks with the eu last year . turkey matters , because the us is looking at the atlanticist view .
yes , turkey is overwhelmingly muslim , but it is a thriving , secular democracy with a free market economy .
it is in the interests of both the us and the eu to anchor turkey in a western institution , and that happens to be the eu , which is at turkey 's doorstep .
the us also has a self-serving interest in turkey 's accession , because it means gaining one more important american ally , which has the same security concerns as the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey is already an old nato ally but turkey is already an american ally and anchored in the west , without being an eu member .
it is a member of several european and transatlantic institutions - the council of europe , the oecd , and it 's part of the eu customs union .
it is an old nato ally and is contributing some 1,000 troops to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon .
is n't that enough ? no .
although no other country has such a special relationship with the eu as turkey does , anything that falls short of full membership , amounts to repackaging what turkey already has , and leads to a dishonest attempt to keep turkey out of eu structures . the " privileged partnership " that german chancellor angela merkel has proposed , already exists .
what merkel is saying is , " let 's keep turkey where it is now . "
the turkish response is , " why have we gone through all these reforms to meet eu criteria for membership , when we do n't have the perspective of joining somewhere down the line ? " the idea of a " privileged partnership " is a dead one .
it 's an idea you would suggest if you want to create a backlash in turkey . but there are critical human rights issues that europe has with turkey , which do n't qualify it for eu membership , such as article 301 of the penal code , which allowed the popular turkish novelist elif shafak to be prosecuted last month , because a fictional character she created " insulted turkishness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : novelist elif shafak was finally acquitted of " insulting turkishness " first of all , no one is talking about turkish membership today , even if accession talks progress smoothly .
the earliest would be 2014 . article 301 is an arcane rule in the books .
prosecutors make charges , and the case is always thrown out by the judge .
it is a nuisance and makes sexy headlines - and unfortunately , reinforces the perception that turkey is backward , but nobody ever gets prosecuted because of it . the real problem between the eu and turkey at the moment is the division of cyprus .
there needs to be mutual recognition between the greek part of the island , which is part of the eu , and turkey .
for its part , turkey needs to open up its ports to greek cypriot shipping , and the eu needs to end the isolation of the turkish part in the north . with germany taking over the rotating eu presidency in january , what can be done to resolve this impasse ? merkel can put considerable pressure on the greek cypriots to compromise with turkey . even if the cyprus issue were to go away , part of the problem is that christian democratic leaders in europe , such as merkel , define europe as a cultural entity with christian values .
is it a problem that turkey is not only huge and poor , but a predominantly muslim country ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a predominantly muslim country compatible with eu membership ?
it is the 6,000 pound elephant in the room , and nobody is talking about it , because we are all politically correct .
geographically , turkey is more european than cyprus , it is wealthier than romania , its human rights record is as good as slovenia , and it 's not that much bigger than poland .
so what 's the problem ? valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- the former french president who drafted the ill-fated european constitution -rrb- is the only leader of stature who brought up the religion issue , amplifying what people on the street think - that the turks are muslim , and therefore not european .
europeans are afraid of islam , and such a large muslim country like turkey does n't sit well with the european public . as long as turkey is seen in the context of this larger muslim world , the problems identified with the muslim world - women 's rights for example - apply to turkey .
the europeans see a clash of civilizations , so of course they will object to turkey joining the eu .
women in turkey , by the way , enjoy equal protection under the law . but the turks are different from their muslim arab neighbors .
just because people share the same faith , does n't mean they share the same political , social , cultural and national identity , or even the same values . admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the european union , and france in particular , truly is .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .
that note is believed to have said : stay awake for the full game , even if it goes into extra time cover the left hand post if fabio grosso gets the ball in the 119th minute do n't believe rumors that alessandro del piero is now rubbish that note would have been worth a fortune , especially if jens had remembered to take it onto the pitch with him . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in semi-final after penalty drama against argentina the first world cup quarter-final of 2006 between germany and argentina went to the wire and a penalty shoot-out after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw after extra-time .

there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .

was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?

germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.10.2006 german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could move its hamburg operations to a cheaper location outside of germany plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm . news that airbus is facing an uncertain future due to the delayed roll-out of the a380 super jumbo jet by at least a year , and the proposed shifting of operations from hamburg to cheaper sites in russia , india and china , has angered politicians and industry officials in germany . politicians in hamburg , home of the airbus plant charged with building the super jumbo 's cabins , are reportedly enraged at prospects of layoffs after the german state spent 750 million euros -lrb- $ 955 million -rrb- to keep the plant running . airbus is responsible for some 40,000 jobs in germany .
berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .
all resources now have to be deployed to salvage the prestigious project , letting others - including succeeding generations of bestseller models - fall by the wayside .
rivals will occupy that niche - and give the europeans a headache . one can only hope that those occupying the executive floors at eads and airbus now make the right decisions , and that it does n't again end with job cuts .
otherwise , the european flight of fancy will end with a crash landing . henrik böhme is a business correspondent for dw-radio -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

top executives better hurry to find a solution , writes dw 's henrik böhme . there was loud cheering when the world 's largest passenger plane - the airbus a380 - took off - and landed safely four hours later - for the first time in public in toulouse , france , in april 2005 .
there was talk about " europe 's high achiever , " about a sign of technological supremacy over the biggest rival , us aircraft maker boeing .
looking at order books , the cheers seemed justified : airbus had significantly more than the competitor on the other side of the atlantic . and today , 18 months later ?
top airbus officials are now conceding that virtually no product series remains where the company is not lagging behind boeing .
wiring problems with high-tech planes are now cited over and over again as the only reason for delayed delivery .
but that only seems to be half the truth .
the problems with the super plane are likely only symptomatic for the overall state of europe 's showcase conglomerate . jumping ship ? ongoing personnel disputes regarding top level posts - especially between the germans and the french - at this most european of all companies have raised doubts about the construct 's efficiency .
british arms producer bae systems , which owned one-fifth of airbus shares , has had it and is reselling to airbus parent company eads .
carmaker daimlerchrysler also wants to reduce its eads shares .
at the same time , russia - via a bank - has bought 5 percent of eads shares .
that 's also causing a certain amount of unrest at the european technology concern , which is involved in the military sector . the current disaster makes one thing clear in particular : intoxicated by success , airbus managers have underestimated their rivals at boeing .
clearly , the americans had serious problems .
but they did their homework and cured the company - without having to watch out for national vanities .
airbus officials still point to the enormous problems boeing faced when launching the 747 jumbo jet .
but that happened four decades ago - at a time when there was no competition .
today , irritated customers , who are put off again and again , have a choice . decision time the real consequences of the airbus crisis can only be speculated about at this point .
technicians will certainly manage to get the wiring problem under control .
but it 's already clear that a380 delays can lead to delays for other airbus projects as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.10.2006 german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could move its hamburg operations to a cheaper location outside of germany plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm . news that airbus is facing an uncertain future due to the delayed roll-out of the a380 super jumbo jet by at least a year , and the proposed shifting of operations from hamburg to cheaper sites in russia , india and china , has angered politicians and industry officials in germany . politicians in hamburg , home of the airbus plant charged with building the super jumbo 's cabins , are reportedly enraged at prospects of layoffs after the german state spent 750 million euros -lrb- $ 955 million -rrb- to keep the plant running . airbus is responsible for some 40,000 jobs in germany .
berlin daily berliner zeitung said the german government was particularly concerned about the future of airbus ' factory in hamburg - which employs some 12,000 people amid rumors that all production activities connected with a380 superjumbo could be transferred to airbus ' parent company eads -lrb- european aeronautic space and defence company -rrb- toulouse in france . germany is present in eads via german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler , but the group has recently reduced its shareholding in the aerospace group from 30 percent to 22.3 percent .
eads announced late tuesday that deliveries of the a380 jet will be delayed by another year on average , meaning the programme is now running up to two years behind schedule .
airbus boss christian streif has called for crisis talks with federal minister for economic affairs michael glos and will meet the minister on thursday to discuss emergency measures to prevent germany losing influence in airbus . a spokesman for glos confirmed on wednesday that the minister would meet with the airbus chief this week . german politicians urge action over airbus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the toulouse plant could become more influential the prospect of a transfer of operations out of germany would be a major blow , according to a number of politicians who have expressed their concern . " such a transfer can not be accepted without resistance , " economic expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer told bild zeitung newspaper wednesday . the social democrats ' economic spokesperson rainer wend added : " we must make it very clear to airbus how much -lrb- the company -rrb- profits from german involvement . " the german government is being urged to intervene to save the plant and stop the operation being moved abroad . government called on to buy stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler 's stake balanced franco-german power thomas mirow , the german finance secretary , has called for berlin to take a direct stake in airbus to prevent the plant from being switched to other foreign alternatives and has also suggested the alternative of the state-bank kfw buying a stake in airbus from daimlerchrysler ag , which owns 22.5 percent of the company , to secure its future . the german government refused to rule out buying the german car maker 's stake , originally designed to balance the influence of the french government and the media group lagadere , which own 22.5 per cent in total , in the long term but had no plans to do so in the " near future . " that left the possibility of kfw stepping in , with the purchase of daimlerchrysler shares being financed by the sale of the state-owned bank 's stakes in deutsche telekom or deutsche post . however , this may also not come in time to save the hamburg operation as kfw , which holds large minority stakes in both former state-owned companies , has promised investors not to sell more post shares until next year and telekom shares until the middle of 2008 . while the german government would welcome the purchase of a stake in airbus as a counterweight to paris and lagadere 's influence , it would go against berlin 's policy in taking stakes in companies and any further state control in airbus may upset the united states , whose boeing company is in direct competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

"
shopping list ?
flirty stranger 's phone number ?
there were many theories about the content of the note jens lehmann referred to during the world cup penalty drama against argentina .
now you can own that note . there seems to be no end to what people are willing to auction in terms of world cup memorabilia .
there have been sections of the berlin olympiastadion 's turf , the ripped-up team cards from the world cup draw , jürgen klinsmann 's old beetle and signs directing fans to toilets in frankfurt . now germany 's world cup goalkeeper jens lehmann has jumped on the bandwagon by offering the mysterious , sweat-soaked note he was seen reading between penalties in the spot-kick shoot-out in the quarter-final against argentina .
the note will be auctioned for charity . female fan infatuated with german goalie ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have n't seen a phone number for my ... err ... plumber ? "
the note caused much speculation .
what was it lehmann was checking ?
was it a shopping list his wife had given him , reminding him what to pick up from the supermarket on his way home after the game ?
was it the phone number of a female fan addressed to his rival , the surprisingly desirable oliver kahn ?
if so , one could understand why jens had to keep looking at it … " is it really for him ?
i do n't get it . " in fact , as lehmann revealed after the game , it was a check list of the penalty habits of argentina 's players which read : riquelme left high crespo long run / right , short run / left heinze left low ayala long wait , long run right messi left aimar long wait left rodriguez left lehmann 's shopping list works a treat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tuna .. beer .. roberto ayala ? "
germany prevailed in the shoot-out and lehmann was the penalty hero , saving two shots .
germany went on to face eventual world cup winners italy in the semi-final where they lost to two late goals . unsubstantiated rumors suggest that lehmann had a note ready for that game too but he inadvertently left it in the changing room .

northern ireland chest , heart and stroke said deaths from stroke could be reduced by a quarter and coronary heart disease by almost a fifth .
this could be achieved by people cutting the amount of salt in their diets to less than five grams a day - about the amount of a teaspoon .
the charity said salt contributed to raised blood pressure .
this is a risk factor for both stroke and heart attack .
it said it was issuing the advice as medical experts launched a global campaign to persuade people worldwide to cut their consumption .
worldwide , it is thought two and a half million deaths could be prevented each year if people halved their salt intake .
dietary surveys the charity said most people in northern ireland exceeded the recommended world health organisation 's daily maximum of 5g .
men average more than twice that number , at 11g per day , while women consume about 8g .
however , much salt is hidden in processed foods , said the nichs .
chief executive andrew dougal said : " in fact , the figures may be even higher .
most estimates are gleaned from dietary surveys , but the information is unreliable .
" we look forward to seeing the results of a research project led by prof barbara livingstone at the university of ulster , which is assessing salt intake in a much more accurate way . "
he said things were confused further because many food labels did not list salt as an ingredient .
" they list sodium , which must be multiplied by two and a half to get the salt content . "

the leaders of both china and south korea had refused to meet former pm junichiro koizumi , a protest at visits to a controversial japanese shrine .
the bilateral meetings will take place against the background of north korea 's announcement that it plans to test a nuclear bomb .
in a statement , mr abe said the north 's announcement was " regrettable " , and any nuclear test by pyongyang would " never be forgivable " .
koizumi shunned the yasukuni shrine honours japan 's war dead , including 14 world war ii war criminals .
yasukuni shrine built in 1869 to honour victims of the boshin civil war now venerates the souls of 2.5m of japan 's war dead those enshrined include 14 class a war criminals abe works on the neighbours japan 's controversial shrine both china and south korea say the shrine glorifies japan 's past militarism , particularly during world war ii .
without referring to the shrine by name , a chinese government spokesman said the summit would go ahead after overcoming " the political obstacle to bilateral relations " .
since his recent election victory mr abe has so far refused to comment on whether he plans to visit the shrine .
but his election has brought the hope of a regional rapprochement .
mr koizumi made six visits to the shrine while he was prime minister , despite protests from japan 's regional neighbours .
the last bilateral summit between japan and china took place in october 2001 , when mr koizumi visited beijing .
the last meeting between the two countries ' leaders came in april 2005 , on the fringes of an asia-african summit in indonesia .

wibree is a new radio frequency technology that can work alongside bluetooth but using just a fraction of the power .
bluetooth is commonly found in mobile phones , printers and laptops and is used to transfer data .
" it 's up to 10 times more energy efficient than bluetooth , " said bob iannucci , nokia research center 's head .
more than 500m devices currently contain bluetooth technology .
nokia has been developing wibree for the last five years and will now put the technology through a standardisation process so that the wireless system can be offered to third-party firms .
" our aim is to establish an industry standard faster than ever before by offering an inter-operable solution that can be commercialised and incorporated into products as quickly as possible , " mr iannucci said .
radio chips wibree radio chips - which operate over a distance of 30ft -lrb- 10m -rrb- - are also smaller than bluetooth chips and will suit devices which up to now do not typically have wireless technology built-in .
watches , health monitors and sport sensors are three of the uses touted by nokia .
the technology is also likely to be used in mobile phones to help prolong battery power .
the new wireless system can transfer data at speeds of up to 1mbps , about a third of the speed of current bluetooth technology .
nokia said it expected the first commercial version of the standard to be available during the second quarter of 2007 .
the firm said it expected dual bluetooth-wibree devices such as mobile phones to hit the market within two years .
" the challenge is getting industry-wide support for yet another wireless standard , given the overwhelming number of standards in play at the moment its hard to see how companies can justify the research and development commitment to all of them , " wireless telecoms analyst ben wood at uk-based collins consulting told reuters news agency .
he added : " bluetooth is clearly not suited to some of the cooler applications like intelligent jewelry , watches - a less power hungry , smaller , cheaper solution will open some interesting new opportunities . "
global sales of bluetooth chips are expected to be between 500 million and 550 million units in 2006 , up from 317 million in 2005 , according to market leader csr .
bluetooth technology was invented by ericsson in the 1990s and was given away to the market as an open standard .

wibree is a new radio frequency technology that can work alongside bluetooth but using just a fraction of the power .
bluetooth is commonly found in mobile phones , printers and laptops and is used to transfer data .
" it 's up to 10 times more energy efficient than bluetooth , " said bob iannucci , nokia research center 's head .
more than 500m devices currently contain bluetooth technology .
nokia has been developing wibree for the last five years and will now put the technology through a standardisation process so that the wireless system can be offered to third-party firms .
" our aim is to establish an industry standard faster than ever before by offering an inter-operable solution that can be commercialised and incorporated into products as quickly as possible , " mr iannucci said .
radio chips wibree radio chips - which operate over a distance of 30ft -lrb- 10m -rrb- - are also smaller than bluetooth chips and will suit devices which up to now do not typically have wireless technology built-in .
watches , health monitors and sport sensors are three of the uses touted by nokia .
the technology is also likely to be used in mobile phones to help prolong battery power .
the new wireless system can transfer data at speeds of up to 1mbps , about a third of the speed of current bluetooth technology .
nokia said it expected the first commercial version of the standard to be available during the second quarter of 2007 .
the firm said it expected dual bluetooth-wibree devices such as mobile phones to hit the market within two years .

nokia has been developing wibree for the last five years and will now put the technology through a standardisation process so that the wireless system can be offered to third-party firms .
" our aim is to establish an industry standard faster than ever before by offering an inter-operable solution that can be commercialised and incorporated into products as quickly as possible , " mr iannucci said .
radio chips wibree radio chips - which operate over a distance of 30ft -lrb- 10m -rrb- - are also smaller than bluetooth chips and will suit devices which up to now do not typically have wireless technology built-in .
watches , health monitors and sport sensors are three of the uses touted by nokia .
the technology is also likely to be used in mobile phones to help prolong battery power .
the new wireless system can transfer data at speeds of up to 1mbps , about a third of the speed of current bluetooth technology .
nokia said it expected the first commercial version of the standard to be available during the second quarter of 2007 .
the firm said it expected dual bluetooth-wibree devices such as mobile phones to hit the market within two years .
" the challenge is getting industry-wide support for yet another wireless standard , given the overwhelming number of standards in play at the moment its hard to see how companies can justify the research and development commitment to all of them , " wireless telecoms analyst ben wood at uk-based collins consulting told reuters news agency .
he added : " bluetooth is clearly not suited to some of the cooler applications like intelligent jewelry , watches - a less power hungry , smaller , cheaper solution will open some interesting new opportunities . "
global sales of bluetooth chips are expected to be between 500 million and 550 million units in 2006 , up from 317 million in 2005 , according to market leader csr .
bluetooth technology was invented by ericsson in the 1990s and was given away to the market as an open standard .

a serious spillage and the discovery of corroding pipes forced it to halt half it operations at its prudhoe bay site .
this meant bp produced 3.8 million barrels of oil per day between july and september - down from more than 4 million in the previous three months .
output was also slightly lower than in the same period a year ago - when hurricanes had hit its operations .
string of problems last month , us congress accused bp of " unacceptable " neglect of its pipelines in alaska .
under questioning , bp bosses admitted some failures but said prudhoe could resume full production in october . "
the silver lining is that bp remains an oil behemoth in global terms " richard hunter , hargreaves lansdown shares in bp have slipped 20 % since april - with the problems at prudhoe bay compounding a string of other woes , including investigations into its trading operations by us regulators and a fire at its texas city plant which killed 15 workers last year .
production at its thunder horse platform in the gulf of mexico is to be delayed due to safety worries .
the site was damaged by a hurricane in 2004 .
the plunging price of crude oil - which on wednesday dipped to below $ 59 a barrel - is also set to hit profits .
" these are torrid times for bp " , said richard hunter of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers , adding that the latest update on production did " little to allay the general malaise surrounding the company " .
he added : " the silver lining is that bp remains an oil behemoth in global terms , and its strong cash flow can be matched by few of its competitors .
its sheer size in many ways enables it to withstand the current problems . "

what has life been like since the success of punk rocker ?
things have been going very , very well .
i 've been all over the world , and i 've done things like t in the park , top of the pops - just loads and loads of stuff really .
it 's been an amazing year so far .
you faced a backlash after the success of the single , with some people saying your webcasts were a cynical marketing ploy .
how do you feel about that now ?
i 'm fine about it , but when it did happen it was a little bit saddening .
it is such a shame when you do something and people take it the wrong way or say it 's something it 's not .
but the only way you can deal with it is to laugh about it and joke it off .
i think if i had taken it all to heart it probably would have really affected me .
what gave you the idea of live gigs over the internet in the first place ?
i actually only first heard of webcasts at a gig last year in edinburgh .
i had never heard or thought about it until that point and it seemed like such a genius thing to do .
my car breaking down on the way to a gig was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
it was the final excuse to go ahead and do it because getting the money to repair the car , or pay for petrol to get me to gigs , was becoming so difficult .
the car is actually being towed back to my mum 's house in scotland as we speak because it 's dead .
do you think the success of your two singles and the album have silenced your critics ?
i think there is something in that .
punk rocker stayed around the top 40 for 20 weeks or something , and it is still at number one in australia after five weeks , which is madness !
i think that is a genuine sign of people actually just liking the record , rather than it being hyped up .
how important is the web to young artists like yourself ?
the web has given artists back a lot of power back .
it 's a medium you can use to talk directly talk to an audience without going through other forms of media to get there .
also , it 's very cost effective if you do n't have money - especially if you 're not signed to a major label and do n't have the money to put ads on the tv and get your record on the radio .
practically everyone i know has a myspace account and it 's a given that you have one if you are a musician .
it 's opening more doors and giving artists another platform to promote themselves on without being signed .
but i think it is also important to realise that there is a balance between taking care of the digital stuff as well as going out to do the live gigs , because , at the end of the day , these people will want to go out and see you live .
it 's ironic that you sing about older , more simple times " when record shops were on top " in punk rocker .
it 's quite funny actually !
i wrote it two-and-a-half-years ago now , so obviously i did n't know i was going end up webcasting , so if that 's an excuse for it , that is one !
maybe in 30 years time someone will be singing about the good old days of the internet ?
yeah !
exactly .
that 's what happens when things go into the past and become archaic .
i saw somebody sitting in the airport the other day with a tape walkman .
i thought , my god !
i have n't seen one of those in over 10 years !
did you ever honestly think your career would take off in the way it has ?
i always wanted to live my life and play music and make my living that way , but i do n't think i ever thought i 'd get to this point .
i 've always been a bit of a dreamer , so i guess i probably dreamt about being on top of the pops , but i do n't think i ever realised i 'd get there .
i am quite gobsmacked .
is it true you once served chips to chris martin of coldplay ?
i used to work in a studio in liverpool that had a cafe bar next to it .
coldplay recorded part of parachutes there , and ate breakfast every morning .
i worked there briefly when i was at university and i served them all breakfasts , which probably had chips on them .
i do n't think i actually knew who they were at the time and it was years later i suddenly had this moment of epiphany ... oh , that was coldplay !
any rock n ' roll stories to share ?
my band and i did get thrown out of hotel recently in la because we were a bit rowdy and a bit drunk and people were jumping in pools at 4'o 'clock in the morning .
it was a bit debauched , but i guess we are all young !
what else do you do when you are young ?
i hear you 're partial to the odd cigar ...
it 's true !
i quit smoking in february and now i 've got a bit of a thing for cigars .
they have to be big knobbly ones like del-boys , not those little things .
cohibas they are called .
they take practically a whole year to smoke !
what next for sandi thom ?
well the uk tour kicks off on wednesday in cardiff , so it 'll be nice to stay in one country for a while and drive around in a tour bus and get really scruffy .
we are working on the next album , which i really want to get out next year .
it 's all good fun .

maybe in 30 years time someone will be singing about the good old days of the internet ?
yeah !
exactly .
that 's what happens when things go into the past and become archaic .
i saw somebody sitting in the airport the other day with a tape walkman .
i thought , my god !
i have n't seen one of those in over 10 years !
did you ever honestly think your career would take off in the way it has ?
i always wanted to live my life and play music and make my living that way , but i do n't think i ever thought i 'd get to this point .
i 've always been a bit of a dreamer , so i guess i probably dreamt about being on top of the pops , but i do n't think i ever realised i 'd get there .
i am quite gobsmacked .
is it true you once served chips to chris martin of coldplay ?
i used to work in a studio in liverpool that had a cafe bar next to it .
coldplay recorded part of parachutes there , and ate breakfast every morning .
i worked there briefly when i was at university and i served them all breakfasts , which probably had chips on them .
i do n't think i actually knew who they were at the time and it was years later i suddenly had this moment of epiphany ... oh , that was coldplay !
any rock n ' roll stories to share ?
my band and i did get thrown out of hotel recently in la because we were a bit rowdy and a bit drunk and people were jumping in pools at 4'o 'clock in the morning .
it was a bit debauched , but i guess we are all young !
what else do you do when you are young ?
i hear you 're partial to the odd cigar ...
it 's true !
i quit smoking in february and now i 've got a bit of a thing for cigars .
they have to be big knobbly ones like del-boys , not those little things .
cohibas they are called .
they take practically a whole year to smoke !
what next for sandi thom ?
well the uk tour kicks off on wednesday in cardiff , so it 'll be nice to stay in one country for a while and drive around in a tour bus and get really scruffy .
we are working on the next album , which i really want to get out next year .
it 's all good fun .

thom 's album smile ...
it confuses people was released in june what has life been like since the success of punk rocker ?
things have been going very , very well .
i 've been all over the world , and i 've done things like t in the park , top of the pops - just loads and loads of stuff really .
it 's been an amazing year so far .
you faced a backlash after the success of the single , with some people saying your webcasts were a cynical marketing ploy .
how do you feel about that now ?
i 'm fine about it , but when it did happen it was a little bit saddening .
it is such a shame when you do something and people take it the wrong way or say it 's something it 's not .
but the only way you can deal with it is to laugh about it and joke it off .
i think if i had taken it all to heart it probably would have really affected me .
what gave you the idea of live gigs over the internet in the first place ?
i actually only first heard of webcasts at a gig last year in edinburgh .
i had never heard or thought about it until that point and it seemed like such a genius thing to do .
my car breaking down on the way to a gig was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
it was the final excuse to go ahead and do it because getting the money to repair the car , or pay for petrol to get me to gigs , was becoming so difficult .
the car is actually being towed back to my mum 's house in scotland as we speak because it 's dead .
do you think the success of your two singles and the album have silenced your critics ?
i think there is something in that .
punk rocker stayed around the top 40 for 20 weeks or something , and it is still at number one in australia after five weeks , which is madness !
i think that is a genuine sign of people actually just liking the record , rather than it being hyped up .
how important is the web to young artists like yourself ?
the web has given artists back a lot of power back .
it 's a medium you can use to talk directly talk to an audience without going through other forms of media to get there .
also , it 's very cost effective if you do n't have money - especially if you 're not signed to a major label and do n't have the money to put ads on the tv and get your record on the radio .
thom peformed at the digital music awards on wednesday practically everyone i know has a myspace account and it 's a given that you have one if you are a musician .
it 's opening more doors and giving artists another platform to promote themselves on without being signed .
but i think it is also important to realise that there is a balance between taking care of the digital stuff as well as going out to do the live gigs , because , at the end of the day , these people will want to go out and see you live .
it 's ironic that you sing about older , more simple times " when record shops were on top " in punk rocker .
it 's quite funny actually !

thom 's album smile ...
it confuses people was released in june what has life been like since the success of punk rocker ?
things have been going very , very well .
i 've been all over the world , and i 've done things like t in the park , top of the pops - just loads and loads of stuff really .
it 's been an amazing year so far .
you faced a backlash after the success of the single , with some people saying your webcasts were a cynical marketing ploy .
how do you feel about that now ?
i 'm fine about it , but when it did happen it was a little bit saddening .
it is such a shame when you do something and people take it the wrong way or say it 's something it 's not .
but the only way you can deal with it is to laugh about it and joke it off .
i think if i had taken it all to heart it probably would have really affected me .
what gave you the idea of live gigs over the internet in the first place ?
i actually only first heard of webcasts at a gig last year in edinburgh .
i had never heard or thought about it until that point and it seemed like such a genius thing to do .
my car breaking down on the way to a gig was the straw that broke the camel 's back .
it was the final excuse to go ahead and do it because getting the money to repair the car , or pay for petrol to get me to gigs , was becoming so difficult .
the car is actually being towed back to my mum 's house in scotland as we speak because it 's dead .
do you think the success of your two singles and the album have silenced your critics ?
i think there is something in that .
punk rocker stayed around the top 40 for 20 weeks or something , and it is still at number one in australia after five weeks , which is madness !
i think that is a genuine sign of people actually just liking the record , rather than it being hyped up .
how important is the web to young artists like yourself ?
the web has given artists back a lot of power back .
it 's a medium you can use to talk directly talk to an audience without going through other forms of media to get there .
also , it 's very cost effective if you do n't have money - especially if you 're not signed to a major label and do n't have the money to put ads on the tv and get your record on the radio .
thom peformed at the digital music awards on wednesday practically everyone i know has a myspace account and it 's a given that you have one if you are a musician .
it 's opening more doors and giving artists another platform to promote themselves on without being signed .
but i think it is also important to realise that there is a balance between taking care of the digital stuff as well as going out to do the live gigs , because , at the end of the day , these people will want to go out and see you live .
it 's ironic that you sing about older , more simple times " when record shops were on top " in punk rocker .
it 's quite funny actually !
i wrote it two-and-a-half-years ago now , so obviously i did n't know i was going end up webcasting , so if that 's an excuse for it , that is one !
maybe in 30 years time someone will be singing about the good old days of the internet ?
yeah !
exactly .
that 's what happens when things go into the past and become archaic .
i saw somebody sitting in the airport the other day with a tape walkman .
i thought , my god !
i have n't seen one of those in over 10 years !
did you ever honestly think your career would take off in the way it has ?
i always wanted to live my life and play music and make my living that way , but i do n't think i ever thought i 'd get to this point .
i 've always been a bit of a dreamer , so i guess i probably dreamt about being on top of the pops , but i do n't think i ever realised i 'd get there .
i am quite gobsmacked .
is it true you once served chips to chris martin of coldplay ?
i used to work in a studio in liverpool that had a cafe bar next to it .
coldplay recorded part of parachutes there , and ate breakfast every morning .
i worked there briefly when i was at university and i served them all breakfasts , which probably had chips on them .
i do n't think i actually knew who they were at the time and it was years later i suddenly had this moment of epiphany ... oh , that was coldplay !
any rock n ' roll stories to share ?
my band and i did get thrown out of hotel recently in la because we were a bit rowdy and a bit drunk and people were jumping in pools at 4'o 'clock in the morning .
it was a bit debauched , but i guess we are all young !
what else do you do when you are young ?
i hear you 're partial to the odd cigar ...
it 's true !
i quit smoking in february and now i 've got a bit of a thing for cigars .
they have to be big knobbly ones like del-boys , not those little things .
cohibas they are called .
they take practically a whole year to smoke !
what next for sandi thom ?
well the uk tour kicks off on wednesday in cardiff , so it 'll be nice to stay in one country for a while and drive around in a tour bus and get really scruffy .
we are working on the next album , which i really want to get out next year .
it 's all good fun .

the figure , which the motor insurers ' bureau -lrb- mib -rrb- said represented a third of all vehicles seized in the uk , is part of a bid to make roads safer .
officers said uninsured drivers were more likely to have convictions for drink-driving or fail to stop at the scene of accidents .
any vehicles not reclaimed are likely to be crushed , scrapped or sold .

the mib said the force 's efforts were a " shining example " of what can be achieved by those committed to catching car criminals .
spokesman neil drane said he was not surprised by the figure in manchester , which represents about 250 seizures every week since january .

the withdrawal means that more than seven million laptops made by toshiba , lenovo , dell , sony and apple have now been affected .
the recalls began in august with the first warnings that sony 's lithium-ion batteries could overheat or catch fire .
analysts have said the battery exchange could affect up to 10 million computers and cost sony as much as $ 500m -lrb- £ 265m -rrb- .
this would halve the net profit of $ 1.1bn that the electronics giant is forecasting for the year to 31 march 2007 .
share slide sony 's share price has been hit by both the recall and the recently-announced delay to the european launch of its new playstation3 video games console .
the shares are down more than 10 % since the laptop battery problem emerged in mid-august .
sony energy device corporation also makes batteries for laptop makers including hewlett packard , sharp and hitachi .
it produces similar batteries for many other portable electronic devices , such as dvd players and games consoles , but so far there has been no sign of a recall affecting any of these products .

sheridan says the tape is faked the news of the world claims it has a videotape which proves scottish politician tommy sheridan lied under oath , because experts have identified his voice saying he used a sex club .
but how certain can they be it 's him ?
" a stitch-up " is how mr sheridan , the former scottish socialist party leader , has branded a tape which allegedly shows him confessing to attending a swingers club .
in august , the glasgow msp won his defamation case against the paper after it accused him of cheating on his wife and attending orgies .
on the new tape , the face of the speaker is not visible but the news of the world says four voice analysts , including one who worked on the " osama bin laden " tapes , have identified him as mr sheridan .
the politician has accused the paper of manufacturing the voice .
so how do experts identify speech and how accurate can they be ?
who , what , why ?
a regular feature in the bbc news magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines forensic speech scientist peter french says voice identification by an expert takes two forms - phonetic and acoustic testing .
a highly trained ear can listen to a voice and perform a phonetic test , which involves transcribing the speech using a system of symbols to denote how , for example , the person pronounces consonants and vowels .
the tests also assess other aspects of speech , such as rhythm , intonation , voice quality and resonance .
the second form of identification , acoustic analysis , is carried out by computer programmes which measure a range of voice parameters such as the rate of vocal chord vibrations , which produce the pitch .
smoking " there 's a large measure of science in it and a bit of subjective judgement too , " says mr french , a leading figure in his field .
" when you look at the results you find they never exactly match 100 % .
it 's not a fixed biometric like a fingerprint .
" speech is a reflexive of human activity and moving your lips and vocal chords can vary , just as people may move their legs differently at different times .
experts use the international phonetic alphabet " it 's affected by things such as tiredness , emotions , smoking and drinking .
people also move up and downmarket according to who they are speaking to . "
this means the results need to be looked at very carefully , he says , to consider whether the differences in results are inconsequential or whether they indicate this could be two different people .
experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial , he says .
but he added he had never heard of a voice being artificially created to match a real one .
" experts can never be 100 % , it 's a balance of probabilities , " says voice expert david howard .
an archetypal yorkshire or lancashire accent may sound fine in the theatre in the evening but it wo n't be enough david howard voice expert " they can give an opinion which leans one way or the other but never 100 % .
" there 's no such thing as a voiceprint like a fingerprint .
so they ca n't say unambiguously ' that 's mr smith ' . "
but there could be a way of pronouncing vowels or other acoustic pointers which make the experts believe it more likely the person on the tape is mr smith .
and mimicry is unlikely to trick the experts , he added .
" if you 're going to change your voice , you have to be really rigorous in changing all aspects of it .

sheridan says the tape is faked the news of the world claims it has a videotape which proves scottish politician tommy sheridan lied under oath , because experts have identified his voice saying he used a sex club .
but how certain can they be it 's him ?
" a stitch-up " is how mr sheridan , the former scottish socialist party leader , has branded a tape which allegedly shows him confessing to attending a swingers club .
in august , the glasgow msp won his defamation case against the paper after it accused him of cheating on his wife and attending orgies .
on the new tape , the face of the speaker is not visible but the news of the world says four voice analysts , including one who worked on the " osama bin laden " tapes , have identified him as mr sheridan .
the politician has accused the paper of manufacturing the voice .
so how do experts identify speech and how accurate can they be ?
who , what , why ?
a regular feature in the bbc news magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines forensic speech scientist peter french says voice identification by an expert takes two forms - phonetic and acoustic testing .
a highly trained ear can listen to a voice and perform a phonetic test , which involves transcribing the speech using a system of symbols to denote how , for example , the person pronounces consonants and vowels .
the tests also assess other aspects of speech , such as rhythm , intonation , voice quality and resonance .
the second form of identification , acoustic analysis , is carried out by computer programmes which measure a range of voice parameters such as the rate of vocal chord vibrations , which produce the pitch .
smoking " there 's a large measure of science in it and a bit of subjective judgement too , " says mr french , a leading figure in his field .
" when you look at the results you find they never exactly match 100 % .
it 's not a fixed biometric like a fingerprint .
" speech is a reflexive of human activity and moving your lips and vocal chords can vary , just as people may move their legs differently at different times .
experts use the international phonetic alphabet " it 's affected by things such as tiredness , emotions , smoking and drinking .
people also move up and downmarket according to who they are speaking to . "
this means the results need to be looked at very carefully , he says , to consider whether the differences in results are inconsequential or whether they indicate this could be two different people .
experts should never say conclusively they have identified a person and this kind of evidence should never solely be used to bring a criminal trial , he says .
but he added he had never heard of a voice being artificially created to match a real one .
" experts can never be 100 % , it 's a balance of probabilities , " says voice expert david howard .
an archetypal yorkshire or lancashire accent may sound fine in the theatre in the evening but it wo n't be enough david howard voice expert " they can give an opinion which leans one way or the other but never 100 % .
" there 's no such thing as a voiceprint like a fingerprint .
so they ca n't say unambiguously ' that 's mr smith ' . "
but there could be a way of pronouncing vowels or other acoustic pointers which make the experts believe it more likely the person on the tape is mr smith .
and mimicry is unlikely to trick the experts , he added .

firms from china and india are most willing to pay bribes abroad to do business , a survey suggests .
anti-corruption group transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- put the two countries at the top of its bribe payers ' index of 30 exporting nations .
french and italian firms were named as the worst culprits for paying bribes in low-income countries .
ti said its survey showed that efforts to introduce anti-corruption laws had yet to slow the problem .
" it is hypocritical that oecd-based companies continue to bribe across the globe , while their governments pay lip-service to enforcing the law , " said ti chief executive david nussbaum .
" the enforcement record on international anti-bribery laws makes for short and disheartening reading . "
big exporters the annual survey , which complements ti 's corruption perceptions index measuring the apparent readiness of countries ' officials to accept bribes , used responses from more than 11,000 businesspeople in 125 countries .
ready to bribe countries whose firms are least prepared to pay bribes : switzerland sweden australia austria canada countries whose firms are most prepared to pay bribes : india china russia turkey taiwan source : transparency international it ranks respondents ' experience of which countries ' firms are most prepared to pay bribes .
ti said it focused on firms from the 30 biggest exporting states , which between them accounted for more than 80 % of all world exports .
the placing of china and india as the home of firms most prepared to pay bribes may partly be the result of the two countries ' rapid industrialisation and their push for resources , analysts said .
russia , too , was near the bottom of the table .
on the other hand , switzerland was ranked as the home of the firms least likely to use off-the-books payments to officials to get business done , with sweden and australia close behind .
the uk was sixth in the list of 30 , with the us joint ninth with belgium .
france , however , was at number 15 and italy at number 20 - with respondents in africa singling them out as much more prone to bribes than other western states .
this , ti said , suggested a double standard - with a number of western companies cleaning up their act close to home while continuing to pay bribes outside the industrialised world .
" although italy and france are singled out for mention , the uk can not escape criticism , " said segun osuntokun , partner at international law firm dla piper , " there have been no prosecutions in the uk in recent times for corruption overseas - even though we have ratified the oecd convention on bribery and it was given effect to in 2001 .
there were too many conflicting and ancient laws covering corruption , mr osuntokun said , described by the law commission as " obscure , complex , inconsistent and insufficiently comprehensive " .

firms from china and india are most willing to pay bribes abroad to do business , a survey suggests .
anti-corruption group transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- put the two countries at the top of its bribe payers ' index of 30 exporting nations .
french and italian firms were named as the worst culprits for paying bribes in low-income countries .
ti said its survey showed that efforts to introduce anti-corruption laws had yet to slow the problem .
" it is hypocritical that oecd-based companies continue to bribe across the globe , while their governments pay lip-service to enforcing the law , " said ti chief executive david nussbaum .
" the enforcement record on international anti-bribery laws makes for short and disheartening reading . "
big exporters the annual survey , which complements ti 's corruption perceptions index measuring the apparent readiness of countries ' officials to accept bribes , used responses from more than 11,000 businesspeople in 125 countries .
ready to bribe countries whose firms are least prepared to pay bribes : switzerland sweden australia austria canada countries whose firms are most prepared to pay bribes : india china russia turkey taiwan source : transparency international it ranks respondents ' experience of which countries ' firms are most prepared to pay bribes .
ti said it focused on firms from the 30 biggest exporting states , which between them accounted for more than 80 % of all world exports .
the placing of china and india as the home of firms most prepared to pay bribes may partly be the result of the two countries ' rapid industrialisation and their push for resources , analysts said .
russia , too , was near the bottom of the table .
on the other hand , switzerland was ranked as the home of the firms least likely to use off-the-books payments to officials to get business done , with sweden and australia close behind .
the uk was sixth in the list of 30 , with the us joint ninth with belgium .
france , however , was at number 15 and italy at number 20 - with respondents in africa singling them out as much more prone to bribes than other western states .
this , ti said , suggested a double standard - with a number of western companies cleaning up their act close to home while continuing to pay bribes outside the industrialised world .
" although italy and france are singled out for mention , the uk can not escape criticism , " said segun osuntokun , partner at international law firm dla piper , " there have been no prosecutions in the uk in recent times for corruption overseas - even though we have ratified the oecd convention on bribery and it was given effect to in 2001 .
there were too many conflicting and ancient laws covering corruption , mr osuntokun said , described by the law commission as " obscure , complex , inconsistent and insufficiently comprehensive " .

uk prime minister tony blair is in one of the uk 's favourite holiday destinations for meetings with his counterpart jose luis rodriguez zapatero .
and 10 years ago , tourism could have been expected to dominate the trade talks at a bilateral summit between spain and the uk .
millions of britons still take holidays in spain each year , but european economic reforms and a spate of takeovers by spanish companies have contributed to the convergence of the two economies on many other levels .
these include spanish bank santander absorbing abbey national , or telecoms giant telefonica buying up the uk 's mobile phone group o2 , to name a couple .
at a luxurious palace on the outskirts of madrid - the location for their first round of discussions - both prime ministers were keen to emphasise the strength of the economic links between their two countries .
but rather than economics , another issue quickly moved to centre-stage .
before tony blair touched down , the spanish media were focusing on the possible contributions the british government could be making to the peace process in the basque region .
after the armed , separatist group eta announced a ceasefire in march , mr zapatero said he was launching a process of dialogue with eta .
at tuesday 's news conference , the spanish prime minister paid tribute to mr blair for his assistance and support as spain begins the long and difficult process of trying to end the conflict in the basque region .
mr zapatero said there was a lot of relevant information in the peace process in northern ireland that is useful to his own government 's bid to end the violence .
mr blair applauded the spanish prime minister 's attempt to bring peace through dialogue , and said patient determination was vital for the peace process to succeed .
this will be seen across spain as an important vindication of the government 's willingness to hold dialogue with eta , despite opposition from the conservative popular party and many victims associations .
warmer relations the uk prime minister also paid tribute to mr zapatero 's leadership on the issue of illegal immigration and said that europe must take a more united stance when it comes to protecting frontiers . "
the anti-war stance of the zapatero administration and willingness to strongly criticise british and american foreign policy associated with the struggle against international terrorism certainly had an impact on anglo-spanish relations " both leaders were in a mutual praise-giving mood .
but that verbal generosity perhaps hints at the fact that not so long ago , relations between the two governments were decidedly chilly .
in the pretty palatial surroundings of this bilateral meeting , it was easy to forget that in march 2004 mr zapatero swept to a surprising election victory , three days after the madrid train bombings killed nearly 200 people .
one of the spanish prime minister 's first important acts was to pull spain 's troops out of the war in iraq , a conflict he described as disastrous .
the former conservative spanish government of jose maria aznar had strongly supported the us-led invasion of iraq and was one of the uk 's strongest allies in europe .
the anti-war stance of the zapatero administration and willingness to strongly criticise british and american foreign policy associated with the struggle against international terrorism certainly had an impact on anglo-spanish relations .
but now - perhaps because iraq has become just one of many urgent international problems including lebanon , darfur and the iran nuclear issue - iraq has apparently lost its sting .
and in september another issue that is a more traditional cause of sour relations between the uk and spain actually helped to improve them .
gibraltar deal after 18 months of talks , ministers from britain , spain and gibraltar signed a series of agreements aimed at improving living conditions for the people of gibraltar .
the accords include easier border crossings and better transport and telecommunications links between spain and the tiny territory known as " the rock " .
mr zapatero described the accord as the most significant agreement concerning the territory for more than 20 years .
the controversial issue of sovereignty over the territory was not touched on - spain still wants control over what it calls europe 's last colony - but the agreement was a sign of improved relations .
quite apart from this gibraltar success and the decreasing impact of iraq , spain and the uk 's friendlier terms are a result of being in situations where it is more important that they enlist each others support .
as the meeting of european heads of state in finland approaches , the uk wants spanish help to progress the so-called lisbon agenda - the ongoing economic liberalisation of the european union .
mr blair is also after spanish diplomatic support to ease the conflict in darfur .
spain , meanwhile , is facing its illegal immigration problem in the canary islands , where about 25,000 africans have arrived by boat this year .
it wants british backing in a push for more assistance from the european union .
the uk and spain appear to have found out that they are far more useful to each other as good allies .

and 10 years ago , tourism could have been expected to dominate the trade talks at a bilateral summit between spain and the uk .
millions of britons still take holidays in spain each year , but european economic reforms and a spate of takeovers by spanish companies have contributed to the convergence of the two economies on many other levels .
these include spanish bank santander absorbing abbey national , or telecoms giant telefonica buying up the uk 's mobile phone group o2 , to name a couple .
at a luxurious palace on the outskirts of madrid - the location for their first round of discussions - both prime ministers were keen to emphasise the strength of the economic links between their two countries .
but rather than economics , another issue quickly moved to centre-stage .
before tony blair touched down , the spanish media were focusing on the possible contributions the british government could be making to the peace process in the basque region .
after the armed , separatist group eta announced a ceasefire in march , mr zapatero said he was launching a process of dialogue with eta .
at tuesday 's news conference , the spanish prime minister paid tribute to mr blair for his assistance and support as spain begins the long and difficult process of trying to end the conflict in the basque region .
mr zapatero said there was a lot of relevant information in the peace process in northern ireland that is useful to his own government 's bid to end the violence .
mr blair applauded the spanish prime minister 's attempt to bring peace through dialogue , and said patient determination was vital for the peace process to succeed .
this will be seen across spain as an important vindication of the government 's willingness to hold dialogue with eta , despite opposition from the conservative popular party and many victims associations .
warmer relations the uk prime minister also paid tribute to mr zapatero 's leadership on the issue of illegal immigration and said that europe must take a more united stance when it comes to protecting frontiers .
the anti-war stance of the zapatero administration and willingness to strongly criticise british and american foreign policy associated with the struggle against international terrorism certainly had an impact on anglo-spanish relations both leaders were in a mutual praise-giving mood .
but that verbal generosity perhaps hints at the fact that not so long ago , relations between the two governments were decidedly chilly .
in the pretty palatial surroundings of this bilateral meeting , it was easy to forget that in march 2004 mr zapatero swept to a surprising election victory , three days after the madrid train bombings killed nearly 200 people .
one of the spanish prime minister 's first important acts was to pull spain 's troops out of the war in iraq , a conflict he described as disastrous .
the former conservative spanish government of jose maria aznar had strongly supported the us-led invasion of iraq and was one of the uk 's strongest allies in europe .
the anti-war stance of the zapatero administration and willingness to strongly criticise british and american foreign policy associated with the struggle against international terrorism certainly had an impact on anglo-spanish relations .
but now - perhaps because iraq has become just one of many urgent international problems including lebanon , darfur and the iran nuclear issue - iraq has apparently lost its sting .
and in september another issue that is a more traditional cause of sour relations between the uk and spain actually helped to improve them .
gibraltar deal after 18 months of talks , ministers from britain , spain and gibraltar signed a series of agreements aimed at improving living conditions for the people of gibraltar .
eta announced a permanent ceasefire in march the accords include easier border crossings and better transport and telecommunications links between spain and the tiny territory known as " the rock " .
mr zapatero described the accord as the most significant agreement concerning the territory for more than 20 years .
the controversial issue of sovereignty over the territory was not touched on - spain still wants control over what it calls europe 's last colony - but the agreement was a sign of improved relations .
quite apart from this gibraltar success and the decreasing impact of iraq , spain and the uk 's friendlier terms are a result of being in situations where it is more important that they enlist each others support .
as the meeting of european heads of state in finland approaches , the uk wants spanish help to progress the so-called lisbon agenda - the ongoing economic liberalisation of the european union .
mr blair is also after spanish diplomatic support to ease the conflict in darfur .
spain , meanwhile , is facing its illegal immigration problem in the canary islands , where about 25,000 africans have arrived by boat this year .
it wants british backing in a push for more assistance from the european union .
the uk and spain appear to have found out that they are far more useful to each other as good allies .

the prize was given to prof kornberg for his work on the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription in cells .
transcription is an important step in the process by which cells build proteins from dna .
the nobel prize is an international award administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm , sweden .
" when the telephone first rang i was completely bewildered , " professor kornberg said in a telephone interview with journalists in the swedish capital .
" i 'm still shaking .
i hope i will be able to calm down shortly . "
roger kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of transcription at the molecular level , in eukaryotes , the category of organisms which includes animals , plants , fungi and simple microscopic organisms called protists .
his studies on transcription described how information is taken from genes and converted to molecules called messenger rna .
these molecules shuttle the information to the cells ' protein-making machinery .
proteins in turn serve as building blocks and workhorses of the cell , vital to its structure and functions .
in 2001 , he published the first molecular snapshot of an enzyme called rna polymerase ii .
its job is to get the synthesis of proteins underway by copying their genes into rnas .
medical importance " understanding of how transcription works also has a fundamental medical importance , " the royal swedish academy said in its citation announcing the award .
" disturbances in the transcription process are involved in many human illnesses such as cancer , heart disease and various kinds of inflammation . "
peter fraser , senior fellow at the medical research council commented : " if the secret of life could be likened to a machine , the process of transcription would be a central cog in the machinery that drives all others .
" kornberg has given us an extraordinarily detailed view of this machine , which is essential for all life . "
professor kornberg is the lone winner of the prize , and the fifth american to win a nobel prize this year .
the 59-year-old is part of the stanford university school of medicine in palo alto , california .
his father , arthur kornberg , shared the 1959 nobel medicine prize with spaniard severo ochoa for studies of how genetic information is transferred from one dna molecule to another .
" i have felt for some time that he richly deserved it , " said the elder kornberg , professor emeritus at the stanford school of medicine .
" his work has been awesome . "
father and son roger kornberg said he remembered traveling to stockholm with his father for the nobel prize award ceremonies .
" i have always been an admirer of his work and that of many others preceding me .
i view them as truly giants of the last 50 years .
it 's hard to count myself among them , " he told journalists .
" something so remarkable as this can never be expected even though i was aware of the possibility .
i could n't conceivably have imagined that it would become reality . "
last year 's nobel laureates were france 's yves chauvin and americans robert grubbs and richard schrock , who were honoured for discoveries that let industry develop drugs and plastics more efficiently and with less hazardous waste .
the kornbergs are the sixth father and son to both win nobel prizes .

the prize was given to prof kornberg for his work on the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription in cells .
transcription is an important step in the process by which cells build proteins from dna .
the nobel prize is an international award administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm , sweden .
" when the telephone first rang i was completely bewildered , " professor kornberg said in a telephone interview with journalists in the swedish capital .
" i 'm still shaking .
i hope i will be able to calm down shortly . "
roger kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of transcription at the molecular level , in eukaryotes , the category of organisms which includes animals , plants , fungi and simple microscopic organisms called protists .
his studies on transcription described how information is taken from genes and converted to molecules called messenger rna .
these molecules shuttle the information to the cells ' protein-making machinery .
proteins in turn serve as building blocks and workhorses of the cell , vital to its structure and functions .
in 2001 , he published the first molecular snapshot of an enzyme called rna polymerase ii .
its job is to get the synthesis of proteins underway by copying their genes into rnas .
medical importance " understanding of how transcription works also has a fundamental medical importance , " the royal swedish academy said in its citation announcing the award .
" disturbances in the transcription process are involved in many human illnesses such as cancer , heart disease and various kinds of inflammation . "
peter fraser , senior fellow at the medical research council commented : " if the secret of life could be likened to a machine , the process of transcription would be a central cog in the machinery that drives all others .
" kornberg has given us an extraordinarily detailed view of this machine , which is essential for all life . "
kornberg is the lone winner of the 2006 chemistry prize professor kornberg is the lone winner of the prize , and the fifth american to win a nobel prize this year .
the 59-year-old is part of the stanford university school of medicine in palo alto , california .
his father , arthur kornberg , shared the 1959 nobel medicine prize with spaniard severo ochoa for studies of how genetic information is transferred from one dna molecule to another .
" i have felt for some time that he richly deserved it , " said the elder kornberg , professor emeritus at the stanford school of medicine .
" his work has been awesome . "
father and son roger kornberg said he remembered traveling to stockholm with his father for the nobel prize award ceremonies .
" i have always been an admirer of his work and that of many others preceding me .
i view them as truly giants of the last 50 years .
it 's hard to count myself among them , " he told journalists .
" something so remarkable as this can never be expected even though i was aware of the possibility .
i could n't conceivably have imagined that it would become reality . "
last year 's nobel laureates were france 's yves chauvin and americans robert grubbs and richard schrock , who were honoured for discoveries that let industry develop drugs and plastics more efficiently and with less hazardous waste .

the national osteoporosis society has criticised national institute of health and clinical excellence bisphosphonates and strontium ranelate recommendations .
the treatments stop or increase bone density for post-menopausal women .
there are no restrictions on their use at the moment , but nice has recommended they only be used for women over 75 .
osteoporosis literally means " porous bones " and makes it more likely for them to fracture as they lose their density .
nice is missing a vital opportunity to protect future generations from the pain and misery that broken bones can cause angela jordan , of the national osteoporosis society over 1m women in the uk have been diagnosed with the disease , although experts say many more probably suffer from the condition .
the drugs are used as a precautionary , or primary prevention , measure - to decrease the risk of a bone fracturing if a woman is deemed at risk because of low bone density and other factors such as family history of the disease .
the nice draft guidance , which is subject to a four-week consultation , is the first time the drugs have been subject to recommendations from the nhs advisory body .
it means to date , post-menopausal women of all ages have effectively had access to the drugs for primary prevention if they were considered at risk .
but the draft recommendations - which are an update on previous draft guidance - say only women over 75 and deemed at risk should get access to them .
fragile nice is also making recommendations on drugs used once a woman has had fractured bones and diagnosed with fragile bones .
it will mean the under 65s will have better access to scans and women in the 55 to 64 age group will be given access to teriparatide , a much more powerful drug , when they have had three or more fractures .
it is currently available only for women over 65 .
angela jordan , deputy chief executive of the national osteoporosis society , said : " these recommendations look set to leave women under 75 without a treatment to prevent the first broken bone .
" nice is missing a vital opportunity to protect future generations from the pain and misery that broken bones can cause . "
nice public health director professor peter littlejohns said the guidance has been designed to give doctors the " most appropriate and cost effective drugs to prescribe " .
" the process that nice follows is genuinely consultative and we welcome feedback . "
