program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.03.2006 soccer 's battle against its own elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g14 now denies it wants to create an exclusive league a " war " is threatening to break out in european soccer , with the continent 's richest 18 clubs thinking aloud about creating an elite league and critcizing fifa . they call themselves the g14 and are made up of europe 's richest and most storied clubs .
since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g14 member juventus turin recently negotiated a 108 million euro tv rights deal " we should invest more in local soccer fields and coming generations rather than give rich clubs even more money , " said michael platini , the former french soccer star and candidate for uefa president . others have appealed for calm in the high-level spat .
per ravn omdal , the vice-president of uefa , called blatter 's comments " unhelpful and not necessary . " balance between social , commercial side former portuguese prime minister jose luis arnaut , who is chairing the eu hearing looking into soccer 's role in european union law , said the g14 had a right to express an opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa 's michael platini made a plea for smaller clubs " we certainly do n't need this sort of talk at this time , " said arnaut .
" we need to star building bridges , not creating bigger ones . " " we need to have a definition of how soccer should be run at all levels from the bottom to the very top , " he said .
" at one end is a social model , but at the other end it is a business model and this is a very difficult to work with .
but we do need to have a balance .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law . " if the president 's idea is to force -lrb- the cpe -rrb- through , promulgate the law and then open dialogue , that 's what we 've been refusing for the last two months , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . bernard thibault , head of the cgt , france 's largest union , warned that if chirac promulgated the bill , it would " torpedo all possibility of discussions " and " aggravate the crisis . " bruno julliard , head of the main student union behind the protests , said it was now up to chirac " to respond to the expectations of a large majority of the population and to force the government to withdraw . " more protests threaten railways and roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris in the spring time , 2006 student groups maintained the pressure thursday with wildcat actions across the country , blocking major highways such as the paris ring road and invading the tracks at railway stations including the capital 's gare de lyon . widespread disruption is predicted for next tuesday , with several transport unions saying they will join the strikes .
the latest were eight unions from air france . an open-ended contract that can be terminated without explanation during a two-year trial period , the cpe is designed to bring down france 's high youth unemployment rate by making it more attractive for employers to take on young staff . law designed to help causing anger among french it was passed by parliament two weeks ago as part of an equal opportunities law designed to help residents of high-immigration suburbs which were hit by last november 's riots and where youth unemployment can top 50 percent . but opponents say it is a step back from france 's hard-won system of social protection toward what they see as the cut-throat labour policies that prevail in britain and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de villepin is fighting for his political life government insiders earlier confirmed reports that villepin warned chirac this week that he would resign if the president sends the cpe back to parliament . the two men have a very close personal relationship , dating from 1995 when villepin became the new president 's cabinet director , and several commentators have spoken of chirac 's growing dependence on the younger man . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than a million join french jobs law protests more than a million people joined strikes and protests across france tuesday in the biggest show of force yet against the government 's new youth jobs law , as skirmishes with police broke out in paris .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .

after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .

the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .

the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .

the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law . " if the president 's idea is to force -lrb- the cpe -rrb- through , promulgate the law and then open dialogue , that 's what we 've been refusing for the last two months , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . bernard thibault , head of the cgt , france 's largest union , warned that if chirac promulgated the bill , it would " torpedo all possibility of discussions " and " aggravate the crisis . " bruno julliard , head of the main student union behind the protests , said it was now up to chirac " to respond to the expectations of a large majority of the population and to force the government to withdraw . " more protests threaten railways and roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris in the spring time , 2006 student groups maintained the pressure thursday with wildcat actions across the country , blocking major highways such as the paris ring road and invading the tracks at railway stations including the capital 's gare de lyon . widespread disruption is predicted for next tuesday , with several transport unions saying they will join the strikes .
the latest were eight unions from air france . an open-ended contract that can be terminated without explanation during a two-year trial period , the cpe is designed to bring down france 's high youth unemployment rate by making it more attractive for employers to take on young staff . law designed to help causing anger among french it was passed by parliament two weeks ago as part of an equal opportunities law designed to help residents of high-immigration suburbs which were hit by last november 's riots and where youth unemployment can top 50 percent . but opponents say it is a step back from france 's hard-won system of social protection toward what they see as the cut-throat labour policies that prevail in britain and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de villepin is fighting for his political life government insiders earlier confirmed reports that villepin warned chirac this week that he would resign if the president sends the cpe back to parliament . the two men have a very close personal relationship , dating from 1995 when villepin became the new president 's cabinet director , and several commentators have spoken of chirac 's growing dependence on the younger man . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than a million join french jobs law protests more than a million people joined strikes and protests across france tuesday in the biggest show of force yet against the government 's new youth jobs law , as skirmishes with police broke out in paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.03.2006 soccer 's battle against its own elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g14 now denies it wants to create an exclusive league a " war " is threatening to break out in european soccer , with the continent 's richest 18 clubs thinking aloud about creating an elite league and critcizing fifa . they call themselves the g14 and are made up of europe 's richest and most storied clubs .
since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g14 member juventus turin recently negotiated a 108 million euro tv rights deal " we should invest more in local soccer fields and coming generations rather than give rich clubs even more money , " said michael platini , the former french soccer star and candidate for uefa president . others have appealed for calm in the high-level spat .
per ravn omdal , the vice-president of uefa , called blatter 's comments " unhelpful and not necessary . " balance between social , commercial side former portuguese prime minister jose luis arnaut , who is chairing the eu hearing looking into soccer 's role in european union law , said the g14 had a right to express an opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa 's michael platini made a plea for smaller clubs " we certainly do n't need this sort of talk at this time , " said arnaut .
" we need to star building bridges , not creating bigger ones . " " we need to have a definition of how soccer should be run at all levels from the bottom to the very top , " he said .
" at one end is a social model , but at the other end it is a business model and this is a very difficult to work with .
but we do need to have a balance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 31.03.2006 soccer 's battle against its own elite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g14 now denies it wants to create an exclusive league a " war " is threatening to break out in european soccer , with the continent 's richest 18 clubs thinking aloud about creating an elite league and critcizing fifa . they call themselves the g14 and are made up of europe 's richest and most storied clubs .
since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g14 member juventus turin recently negotiated a 108 million euro tv rights deal " we should invest more in local soccer fields and coming generations rather than give rich clubs even more money , " said michael platini , the former french soccer star and candidate for uefa president . others have appealed for calm in the high-level spat .
per ravn omdal , the vice-president of uefa , called blatter 's comments " unhelpful and not necessary . " balance between social , commercial side former portuguese prime minister jose luis arnaut , who is chairing the eu hearing looking into soccer 's role in european union law , said the g14 had a right to express an opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa 's michael platini made a plea for smaller clubs " we certainly do n't need this sort of talk at this time , " said arnaut .
" we need to star building bridges , not creating bigger ones . " " we need to have a definition of how soccer should be run at all levels from the bottom to the very top , " he said .
" at one end is a social model , but at the other end it is a business model and this is a very difficult to work with .
but we do need to have a balance .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter is furious " in principal , g14 could renounce some or all of the past damages , on the basis that all clubs , not just g14 clubs , were protected in the near future , " read a g14 statement .
the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g14 member juventus turin recently negotiated a 108 million euro tv rights deal " we should invest more in local soccer fields and coming generations rather than give rich clubs even more money , " said michael platini , the former french soccer star and candidate for uefa president . others have appealed for calm in the high-level spat .
per ravn omdal , the vice-president of uefa , called blatter 's comments " unhelpful and not necessary . " balance between social , commercial side former portuguese prime minister jose luis arnaut , who is chairing the eu hearing looking into soccer 's role in european union law , said the g14 had a right to express an opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uefa 's michael platini made a plea for smaller clubs " we certainly do n't need this sort of talk at this time , " said arnaut .
" we need to star building bridges , not creating bigger ones . " " we need to have a definition of how soccer should be run at all levels from the bottom to the very top , " he said .

since forming in 2000 , the group - since expanded to 18 - has been a permanent thorn in the side of fifa boss sepp blatter .
the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .

the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law . " if the president 's idea is to force -lrb- the cpe -rrb- through , promulgate the law and then open dialogue , that 's what we 've been refusing for the last two months , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . bernard thibault , head of the cgt , france 's largest union , warned that if chirac promulgated the bill , it would " torpedo all possibility of discussions " and " aggravate the crisis . " bruno julliard , head of the main student union behind the protests , said it was now up to chirac " to respond to the expectations of a large majority of the population and to force the government to withdraw . " more protests threaten railways and roads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris in the spring time , 2006 student groups maintained the pressure thursday with wildcat actions across the country , blocking major highways such as the paris ring road and invading the tracks at railway stations including the capital 's gare de lyon . widespread disruption is predicted for next tuesday , with several transport unions saying they will join the strikes .
the latest were eight unions from air france . an open-ended contract that can be terminated without explanation during a two-year trial period , the cpe is designed to bring down france 's high youth unemployment rate by making it more attractive for employers to take on young staff . law designed to help causing anger among french it was passed by parliament two weeks ago as part of an equal opportunities law designed to help residents of high-immigration suburbs which were hit by last november 's riots and where youth unemployment can top 50 percent . but opponents say it is a step back from france 's hard-won system of social protection toward what they see as the cut-throat labour policies that prevail in britain and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de villepin is fighting for his political life government insiders earlier confirmed reports that villepin warned chirac this week that he would resign if the president sends the cpe back to parliament . the two men have a very close personal relationship , dating from 1995 when villepin became the new president 's cabinet director , and several commentators have spoken of chirac 's growing dependence on the younger man . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more than a million join french jobs law protests more than a million people joined strikes and protests across france tuesday in the biggest show of force yet against the government 's new youth jobs law , as skirmishes with police broke out in paris .
-lrb- march 29 , 2006 -rrb- french unions and students call for general strike french unions and student bodies called on monday for a general strike and protest marches on march 28 to pressure the government to withdraw a job law they say will create insecurity for a generation of young workers .

the volatile swiss , always good for a quote or two , has refused to bend to g14 demands that fifa compensate clubs when their players are injured during national team matches .
in fact , he refuses to negotiate with them entirely .
the brussels-based lobbying organization 's statements timed to a court hearing sent blatter into a blather . " if the g14 want war , they will have it , " he said . scoffing at us-style " entertainment " french club charleroi , which is not a member of the g14 but enjoys its support , filed a lawsuit this week against fifa involving player abdelmajid oulmers , who returned from national duty with the moroccan team injured .
the g14 , which has supported similar complaint by olympique lyon , claims fifa should compensate clubs when a player is injured .
the group has proposed sharing in a percentage of the revenues of tournaments like the world cup , that will be redistributed to clubs who release their players for international duty .

the statements coupled with loud musings of forming a permanent champion 's league , which no team outside of the group would be able to enter , prompted stiff rebuttals from both blatter and europe 's soccer association , uefa .
" to them , it 's no longer about the sport , but about top entertainment , like in american football , or wrestling , " said william gaillard , the uefa communications director . profit-hungry sharks the uefa argues that competitors in the champion 's league , which always include g14 teams like ac milan , bayern munich and real madrid , already earn 415 million euros in television and other revenues by taking part in the competition .
after winning last year , liverpool alone received 30.6 million euros .
to blatter and the uefa , the g14 stance is further confirmation of their image as profit-hungry spoilers determined to widen the gulf between rich and poor in the " beautiful game " .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law . " if the president 's idea is to force -lrb- the cpe -rrb- through , promulgate the law and then open dialogue , that 's what we 've been refusing for the last two months , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . bernard thibault , head of the cgt , france 's largest union , warned that if chirac promulgated the bill , it would " torpedo all possibility of discussions " and " aggravate the crisis .

three youths were ordered jailed for two months thursday for violence against police during the paris protests . another day of action is planned for next tuesday . while chirac expected to sign , concessions could be on offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac and dominique de villepin are under pressure government officials said that in order to assuage opposition anger , chirac will offer top-level negotiations similar to the ones that helped end the may 1968 student uprising and worker strikes . if these talks produced proposals for youth employment which could replace the cpe , then chirac would make a commitment to implement them , the officials said . but unions and students want chirac to use his powers to send the cpe back to parliament , effectively killing it . socialist leader francois hollande warned chirac that he would be entering into a " trial of strength " if he signed the cpe into law . " if the president 's idea is to force -lrb- the cpe -rrb- through , promulgate the law and then open dialogue , that 's what we 've been refusing for the last two months , " said francois chereque of the cfdt union . bernard thibault , head of the cgt , france 's largest union , warned that if chirac promulgated the bill , it would " torpedo all possibility of discussions " and " aggravate the crisis . " bruno julliard , head of the main student union behind the protests , said it was now up to chirac " to respond to the expectations of a large majority of the population and to force the government to withdraw .

core consumer price inflation -lrb- cpi -rrb- , which excludes food , rose 0.5 % in february compared to a year earlier .
meanwhile , japan 's unemployment rate fell to 4.1 % in february from 4.4 % , its biggest drop on record .
experts said the figures underlined hopes that healthy consumer spending will push up prices , leading to a rise in interest rates from almost zero .
" the jobless rate could fall below 4 % in march or april , and that could prompt views that growing employment will further push up prices , " naoki iizuka , chief economist at dai-ichi life research institute , said .
improving fortunes japan 's jobless figure was the lowest rate since 1998 .
the japanese economy has been making a steady recovery over the past year , boosting domestic demand and improving the outlook for exporters .
the bank of japan recently announced plans to tighten its longstanding ' ultra-loose ' monetary policy , indicative of the economy 's improving fortunes .
further good news is expected when the country 's quarterly tankan business confidence survey is released on monday - with the report expected to show its fourth improvement in a row .
improvements in the world 's number two economy and its upbeat outlook have pushed stocks on tokyo 's nikkei to five year highs .
the rise in share prices has come despite a higher-than-expected fall of 1.7 % in industrial production for february being announced on thursday .
" combined with other economic data we 've seen recently , it 's safe to say the japanese economy is maintaining its upward trajectory , " said masaki fukui , senior market economist at mizuho corporate bank said .

"
i 'll take the job if they give it to me ...
i have no choice . "
chaouki aroua four decades ago , unrest thrived on a heady mix of ideology and hope .
the current protests are fuelled by fear and insecurity .
the 1968 protesters rejected mainstream society .
their modern brethren are angry at being kept out .
the issue that prompted the recent wave of demonstrations is a job scheme , called cpe , that allows employers to sack young workers at will during a two-year trial period .
this is anathema to a generation that feels shut out from the world of steady work .
lucky to be employed take the story of chaouki aroua , a 24-year-old business graduate from bondy , just north of paris .
" i left university almost two years ago and i 'm still looking for a decent sales job , " he says .
" i can probably find work flogging tyres or soap , but i have n't studied for four years to do that .
i prefer being a cleaner . "
in fact , that is just what he is .
after cleaning underground stations every day , chaouki returns to his parents ' home - he can not afford to get his own - and scans the internet for jobs .
" there are very few to go round , and i 'm at the back of the queue as i have no relevant experience . "
in desperation he applied for a job as a train driver - hiding his business degree to avoid being rejected as overqualified .
" i 'll take the job if they give it to me , " he says ruefully .
" i have no choice . "
chaouki is among the lucky ones - at least he is employed .
unpaid work joblessness is endemic among the 15-24 age-group in france . "
i do n't have the paperwork for full unemployment benefits " thierry de ville d 'avray about 23 % are registered as unemployed - an extremely high figure by international standards .
many more youths are not even looking for work .
not only does france create few entry-level jobs - but most are being offered on a casual basis .
the grim realities of the french labour market were brought home to baptiste thierry de ville d 'avray , 24 , a budding photographer who completed a university course in multimedia technologies two years ago .
" i worked in bars and restaurants for a year - most of it was not declared , which means i do n't have the paperwork for full unemployment benefits , " he says .
last year , baptiste left a line of work he considered stultifying and is doing work with a co-operative of photographers - but he is not being paid .
destitution risk most graduates who do find work are caught on an endless treadmill of dreary short-term jobs , interspersed with unemployed spells .
raymond torres , head of employment policy unit at the oecd , says only 45 % of those with short-term contracts get permanent jobs within three years .
in germany and the uk , the figure is 60 % .
" it is very difficult once you have a short-term contract to get out of this situation in france , " mr torres told the bbc news website .
such grim prospects haunt the current generation of school-leavers and graduates .
without stable jobs , many find it all-but impossible to rent flats and live normal lives .
nadia , a volunteer for ac ! , an association that helps the destitute , says she sees increasing numbers of young people whose lives are blighted by dead-end jobs .
" things are getting worse , " she says .
" until about three years ago , most of the people we dealt with were long-term unemployed .
" now two-thirds have recently had some sort casual or temporary work that led to nothing . "
" many people today live from one month to the next . "
craving security the reasons for the lack of good jobs are many and complex .
mr torres says a university system divorced from the world of business is one factor .
" typically french youths come out of four or five years in universities with no work experience whatsoever , " he says .
furthermore , employers are reluctant to hire as shedding staff is cumbersome and risky .
" the legal uncertainty surrounding dismissals is a major source of labour rigidity and that may explain why employers are loathe to give permanent contracts , " mr torres adds .
whatever the cause , the result is that the young in france crave job security above all - 75 % say they want to be public servants .
this explains their opposition to the government 's plan , which is aimed at making labour markets more fluid .
concern for the future some french students , however , do not take a dim view of labour flexibility .
renaud , 26 , was hired straight out of university under a new scheme similar to the cpe introduced last year - without triggering any protests - for companies with fewer than 20 employees .
he now works for a small financial consulting firm .
" i am rather in favour of flexible work contracts , " renaud says .
" it enables employers to take someone on without committing themselves for the long term . "
" i prefer to live in a world where you can get fired within two weeks but find work quickly , than in a world where you have a job for life but it takes five years to find another if you lose it . "
renaud , who holds a masters ' degree in finance and oozes confidence , is very much in the minority among french students .
most - unlike the 1968-ers who wanted to change the world - worry about the future and are desperate to hold on to whatever job stability they can salvage .

i 'll take the job if they give it to me ...
i have no choice .
chaouki aroua four decades ago , unrest thrived on a heady mix of ideology and hope .
the current protests are fuelled by fear and insecurity .
the 1968 protesters rejected mainstream society .
their modern brethren are angry at being kept out .
the issue that prompted the recent wave of demonstrations is a job scheme , called cpe , that allows employers to sack young workers at will during a two-year trial period .
this is anathema to a generation that feels shut out from the world of steady work .
lucky to be employed take the story of chaouki aroua , a 24-year-old business graduate from bondy , just north of paris .
" i left university almost two years ago and i 'm still looking for a decent sales job , " he says .
" i can probably find work flogging tyres or soap , but i have n't studied for four years to do that .
i prefer being a cleaner . "
in fact , that is just what he is .
after cleaning underground stations every day , chaouki returns to his parents ' home - he can not afford to get his own - and scans the internet for jobs .
" there are very few to go round , and i 'm at the back of the queue as i have no relevant experience . "
in desperation he applied for a job as a train driver - hiding his business degree to avoid being rejected as overqualified .
" i 'll take the job if they give it to me , " he says ruefully .
" i have no choice . "
chaouki is among the lucky ones - at least he is employed .
unpaid work joblessness is endemic among the 15-24 age-group in france .
i do n't have the paperwork for full unemployment benefits thierry de ville d 'avray about 23 % are registered as unemployed - an extremely high figure by international standards .
many more youths are not even looking for work .
not only does france create few entry-level jobs - but most are being offered on a casual basis .
the grim realities of the french labour market were brought home to baptiste thierry de ville d 'avray , 24 , a budding photographer who completed a university course in multimedia technologies two years ago .
" i worked in bars and restaurants for a year - most of it was not declared , which means i do n't have the paperwork for full unemployment benefits , " he says .
last year , baptiste left a line of work he considered stultifying and is doing work with a co-operative of photographers - but he is not being paid .
destitution risk most graduates who do find work are caught on an endless treadmill of dreary short-term jobs , interspersed with unemployed spells .
raymond torres , head of employment policy unit at the oecd , says only 45 % of those with short-term contracts get permanent jobs within three years .
in germany and the uk , the figure is 60 % .
" it is very difficult once you have a short-term contract to get out of this situation in france , " mr torres told the bbc news website .
such grim prospects haunt the current generation of school-leavers and graduates .
without stable jobs , many find it all-but impossible to rent flats and live normal lives .
nadia , a volunteer for ac ! , an association that helps the destitute , says she sees increasing numbers of young people whose lives are blighted by dead-end jobs .
" things are getting worse , " she says .
" until about three years ago , most of the people we dealt with were long-term unemployed .
" now two-thirds have recently had some sort casual or temporary work that led to nothing . "
" many people today live from one month to the next . "
craving security the reasons for the lack of good jobs are many and complex .
mr torres says a university system divorced from the world of business is one factor .
unemployment in france is not a crime , but it can be a long sentence " typically french youths come out of four or five years in universities with no work experience whatsoever , " he says .
furthermore , employers are reluctant to hire as shedding staff is cumbersome and risky .
" the legal uncertainty surrounding dismissals is a major source of labour rigidity and that may explain why employers are loathe to give permanent contracts , " mr torres adds .
whatever the cause , the result is that the young in france crave job security above all - 75 % say they want to be public servants .
this explains their opposition to the government 's plan , which is aimed at making labour markets more fluid .
concern for the future some french students , however , do not take a dim view of labour flexibility .
renaud , 26 , was hired straight out of university under a new scheme similar to the cpe introduced last year - without triggering any protests - for companies with fewer than 20 employees .
he now works for a small financial consulting firm .
" i am rather in favour of flexible work contracts , " renaud says .
" it enables employers to take someone on without committing themselves for the long term . "

the us and eu have accused china of imposing illegal tariffs to prevent foreign components being imported for use in chinese car assembly plants .
the two have now turned to the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- to open up the $ 19bn -lrb- £ 10.8bn -rrb- auto parts market .
the row is the latest in a series of disputes triggered by china 's growing muscle in the global trade market .
brussels and washington have now taken formal steps to resolve the row .
as a result , china now has 10 days to respond to the request from the eu and us - if the matter is not resolved within 60 days a formal wto panel could step in to rule on the dispute .
" the chinese side expresses regret over this and is earnestly studying the request for consultations by the eu and the united states , " ministry of commerce spokesman , chong quan said in a statement on the department 's website .
ongoing battle it marks the first time the eu has taken china to the wto since 2001 , while it is the second case that the us has brought and comes days after brussels decided to slap " ' anti-dumping " tariffs on leather shoe imports from asia .
both brussels and washington have been complaining that china has failed to open up access to its domestic markets while the eu and us have been flooded with cheap chinese products .
they have also raised objections to the counterfeiting of western goods - such as luxury brand clothing , dvds and music - while the us has also accused the country of holding its currency at deliberately low levels .
western carmakers have invested heavily in the fast-growing chinese market .
as a result they now account for almost a quarter of the country 's vehicle production .
however , under chinese law , if imported parts make up more than 60 % of the vehicle they are taxed at a rate equal to the tariff on an imported car - raising their tariff from 10-14 % to the higher rate of 28 % .

the us and eu have accused china of imposing illegal tariffs to prevent foreign components being imported for use in chinese car assembly plants .
the two have now turned to the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- to open up the $ 19bn -lrb- £ 10.8bn -rrb- auto parts market .
the row is the latest in a series of disputes triggered by china 's growing muscle in the global trade market .
brussels and washington have now taken formal steps to resolve the row .
as a result , china now has 10 days to respond to the request from the eu and us - if the matter is not resolved within 60 days a formal wto panel could step in to rule on the dispute .
" the chinese side expresses regret over this and is earnestly studying the request for consultations by the eu and the united states , " ministry of commerce spokesman , chong quan said in a statement on the department 's website .
ongoing battle it marks the first time the eu has taken china to the wto since 2001 , while it is the second case that the us has brought and comes days after brussels decided to slap " ' anti-dumping " tariffs on leather shoe imports from asia .
both brussels and washington have been complaining that china has failed to open up access to its domestic markets while the eu and us have been flooded with cheap chinese products .
they have also raised objections to the counterfeiting of western goods - such as luxury brand clothing , dvds and music - while the us has also accused the country of holding its currency at deliberately low levels .
western carmakers have invested heavily in the fast-growing chinese market .
as a result they now account for almost a quarter of the country 's vehicle production .
however , under chinese law , if imported parts make up more than 60 % of the vehicle they are taxed at a rate equal to the tariff on an imported car - raising their tariff from 10-14 % to the higher rate of 28 % .
beijing says the rules are aimed at preventing manufacturers from evading taxes by importing cars bit by bit then reassembling them in china .

the child has a fever and is crying .
two days earlier he 'd been diagnosed with acute flaccid paralysis after he lost the use of one of his legs .
tests are expected to confirm that he too has polio .
his mother jamilah says he 's never been vaccinated because her husband refused to allow it .
" please , " she says , " do n't let him become a cripple . "
but it is probably too late .
there is no cure for polio .
outside the house it is easy to see how osman contracted polio .
like many parts of nigeria , there are open sewers running along the streets .
children are everywhere playing games in the streets and running through the sewers .
polio is passed on through faeces .
for every paralysed child there are 200 carriers .
on the rise in most parts of the world three or four doses of polio vaccine , administered as a small baby , are enough to provide protection .
but in nigeria there is so much polio virus around that children under the age of five have to be immunised over and over again . "
my children have been vaccinated four times .
why do you people keep coming round month after month ? "
kano mother even seven or eight times is not enough .
this is very difficult to achieve .
rates of non-compliance are high , and even though vaccination rounds are done several times a year children keep getting missed .
there have been some successes though .
in nigeria polio is now largely confined to just eight states in the north of the country .
but there the numbers of victims are rising , not falling .
confirmed cases grew from 781 in 2004 to 801 in 2005 .
so far this year there have been 31 new polio victims and tests are awaited on 55 other suspected cases .
nigeria now accounts for more than half the world 's polio victims .
training in the classroom of a dilapidated school in kano in the north , mothers sit at the desks , being trained in how to be a vaccinator .
a whole army is needed for the vaccination rounds , as teams of women go from door to door immunising children .
they appear to know their stuff .
" it does n't harm the child - it has no overdose , " says one mother .
another chips in : " it 's a booster , to boost the immunity .
even if they take it a thousand times it wo n't harm them . "
the rest of the class applaud .
in parts of muslim northern nigeria , only women can enter households if the husband is not present , so all the vaccinators are women , and they are paid a small amount of money for their time .
in parts of northern nigeria more than 50 % of the children have never been vaccinated against polio , and often their parents refuse to cooperate because of mistrust and suspicion .
for more than a year from mid-2003 the northern states stopped the vaccination programme altogether after rumours swept the country that the polio vaccine caused aids and that it was all part of a western plot to sterilise muslim girls .
many still believe these scare stories and its one of the main reasons why people still refuse to vaccinate their children doors marked nafiu baba ahmed , secretary general of the supreme council for sharia in nigeria , has 16 children and none of them have been immunised against polio .
" there are greater risks than polio , " he says .
" i think either this is an imaginary thing created in the west or it is a ploy to get us to submit to this evil agenda . "
the suspension if the immunisation programme was a disaster for those like the world health organization trying to eradicate polio .

when finished , the automated system will search through records of the patterns on soles to identify the footwear used by a criminal .
it aims to increase the usefulness of shoeprints by using a common labelling systems for features found on soles .
the pilot system can already identify 85 % of samples .
good intelligence the realisation that criminals would find it almost impossible to avoid leaving shoeprints behind at a crime scene prompted a change in the law , said professor nigel allinson of the university of sheffield , who is leading the work on the identification system the serious organised crime police act 2005 now gives the prints the same legal status as dna and fingerprint evidence . "
luckily criminals wear trainers .
if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position " professor nigel allinson , university of sheffield " we all leave footprints , and though they are not as unique as dna or fingerprints , they are good intelligence and can be good evidence , " said professor allinson at a london conference on science and forensic work .
home office statistics show that 14.8 % of crime scenes attended by crime scene investigators in 2004-2005 yielded shoe print evidence .
the serious organised crime police act 2005 also gives police powers to take shoe prints from suspects .
before now , relatively few forces have routinely taken such prints .
although some forces do take shoe prints and compare what they find at crime scenes with what is on file , much of the analysis comes down to human interpretation of the features found on soles , said professor allinson .
this is the reason why little of the data gathered by individual forces was consistently labelled .
by contrast , the system professor allinson and his colleagues are working on aims to automatically classify the features found on shoe soles , so crime scene evidence can be easily compared with records on file .
common giveaway this classification should be straightforward , said professor allinson , because criminals favour shoes that have many distinct features on their soles .
" luckily criminals wear trainers , " he said .
" if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position . "
the identification system works by subjecting shoeprints to several different image processing techniques to reveal the features on the sole .
the first stage cycles through levels of brightness in the image to see which features , such as logos , circles or ridges , persist at extremes of light and dark .
the captured features are then processed so they can be recognised at different rotations and scales .
finally , these distinct features are analysed to see how they lie in relation to each other .
the prototype system can match prints taken in custody suites with those in the database 85 % of the time , said professor allinson .
he emphasised that it has yet to be tried with partial shoeprints found at crime scenes .
now work is being carried out to improve the system 's detection rate and to make the whole system easy to use .
" it has to be a pretty much automatic system if its going to be successful , " said professor allinson .
he presented information about his research at an event in london organised by the engineering and physical sciences research council to highlight how science can aid forensic work .

when finished , the automated system will search through records of the patterns on soles to identify the footwear used by a criminal .
it aims to increase the usefulness of shoeprints by using a common labelling systems for features found on soles .
the pilot system can already identify 85 % of samples .
good intelligence the realisation that criminals would find it almost impossible to avoid leaving shoeprints behind at a crime scene prompted a change in the law , said professor nigel allinson of the university of sheffield , who is leading the work on the identification system the serious organised crime police act 2005 now gives the prints the same legal status as dna and fingerprint evidence .
luckily criminals wear trainers .
if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position professor nigel allinson , university of sheffield " we all leave footprints , and though they are not as unique as dna or fingerprints , they are good intelligence and can be good evidence , " said professor allinson at a london conference on science and forensic work .
home office statistics show that 14.8 % of crime scenes attended by crime scene investigators in 2004-2005 yielded shoe print evidence .
the serious organised crime police act 2005 also gives police powers to take shoe prints from suspects .
before now , relatively few forces have routinely taken such prints .
although some forces do take shoe prints and compare what they find at crime scenes with what is on file , much of the analysis comes down to human interpretation of the features found on soles , said professor allinson .
this is the reason why little of the data gathered by individual forces was consistently labelled .
by contrast , the system professor allinson and his colleagues are working on aims to automatically classify the features found on shoe soles , so crime scene evidence can be easily compared with records on file .
common giveaway this classification should be straightforward , said professor allinson , because criminals favour shoes that have many distinct features on their soles .
" luckily criminals wear trainers , " he said .
" if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position . "
the identification system works by subjecting shoeprints to several different image processing techniques to reveal the features on the sole .
the first stage cycles through levels of brightness in the image to see which features , such as logos , circles or ridges , persist at extremes of light and dark .
the captured features are then processed so they can be recognised at different rotations and scales .
finally , these distinct features are analysed to see how they lie in relation to each other .
the prototype system can match prints taken in custody suites with those in the database 85 % of the time , said professor allinson .
he emphasised that it has yet to be tried with partial shoeprints found at crime scenes .
now work is being carried out to improve the system 's detection rate and to make the whole system easy to use .
" it has to be a pretty much automatic system if its going to be successful , " said professor allinson .

when finished , the automated system will search through records of the patterns on soles to identify the footwear used by a criminal .
it aims to increase the usefulness of shoeprints by using a common labelling systems for features found on soles .
the pilot system can already identify 85 % of samples .
good intelligence the realisation that criminals would find it almost impossible to avoid leaving shoeprints behind at a crime scene prompted a change in the law , said professor nigel allinson of the university of sheffield , who is leading the work on the identification system the serious organised crime police act 2005 now gives the prints the same legal status as dna and fingerprint evidence .
luckily criminals wear trainers .
if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position professor nigel allinson , university of sheffield " we all leave footprints , and though they are not as unique as dna or fingerprints , they are good intelligence and can be good evidence , " said professor allinson at a london conference on science and forensic work .
home office statistics show that 14.8 % of crime scenes attended by crime scene investigators in 2004-2005 yielded shoe print evidence .
the serious organised crime police act 2005 also gives police powers to take shoe prints from suspects .
before now , relatively few forces have routinely taken such prints .
although some forces do take shoe prints and compare what they find at crime scenes with what is on file , much of the analysis comes down to human interpretation of the features found on soles , said professor allinson .
this is the reason why little of the data gathered by individual forces was consistently labelled .
by contrast , the system professor allinson and his colleagues are working on aims to automatically classify the features found on shoe soles , so crime scene evidence can be easily compared with records on file .
common giveaway this classification should be straightforward , said professor allinson , because criminals favour shoes that have many distinct features on their soles .
" luckily criminals wear trainers , " he said .
" if they all wore oxford brogues we would be in a very difficult position . "
the identification system works by subjecting shoeprints to several different image processing techniques to reveal the features on the sole .
the first stage cycles through levels of brightness in the image to see which features , such as logos , circles or ridges , persist at extremes of light and dark .
the captured features are then processed so they can be recognised at different rotations and scales .
finally , these distinct features are analysed to see how they lie in relation to each other .
the prototype system can match prints taken in custody suites with those in the database 85 % of the time , said professor allinson .
he emphasised that it has yet to be tried with partial shoeprints found at crime scenes .
now work is being carried out to improve the system 's detection rate and to make the whole system easy to use .
" it has to be a pretty much automatic system if its going to be successful , " said professor allinson .
he presented information about his research at an event in london organised by the engineering and physical sciences research council to highlight how science can aid forensic work .

kathleen marshall 's comments came after a new study said unaccompanied children had been given unsuitable accommodation in homeless hostels .
it also said they received inadequate mental health services .
almost 200 children have arrived in scotland alone to seek asylum since 2001 .
about a third came from somalia .
the scottish refugee council research found that more than 60 % were aged 16-17 .
professor marshall said under-18s seeking asylum alone in scotland were more vulnerable than those in england , where specialist advisers supported them through the process .
child asylum seekers most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader a home office spokeswoman said it recognised there were problems in the way the children were given care and said it had established a small team to examine ways of better serving the group .
the study , from glasgow university 's centre for the child and society , found that the majority had fled their country of origin because of war , sexual assault or the death of family members .
the research , which centred on 30 children and representatives of more than 70 agencies , found that services varied dramatically across scotland .
while the education system was the most positively received , accommodation was seen generally seen as " very poor " .
the report stated : " some children are housed in accommodation for homeless people , and find such places disruptive , abusive and dangerous .
" others stay in bed and breakfast accommodation for considerable lengths of time . "
" the most glaring anomaly is the lack of any equivalent in scotland of the independent panel of advisors in england " professor marshall it also described how many interviewees faced racism , isolation and mental health issues when they arrived in scotland and concluded that support services and out of school activities were lacking .
it also called for race awareness training for all staff working with the minors as it claimed " the evidence of racism amongst staff working with unaccompanied asylum seeking children is very worrying " .
professor marshall told bbc scotland 's news website : " i think the most glaring anomaly is the lack of any equivalent in scotland of the independent panel of advisors in england .
" this leaves those in scotland particularly vulnerable .
" some of the worst effects of that have been mitigated by the dedication of some social work and education staff and children 's rights officers , who are passionately committed to these young people ; but that is no excuse for not addressing the matter more comprehensively . "
race equality a scottish executive spokeswoman said the scottish refugee integration forum was examining the barriers that refugees and asylum seekers faced in accessing services and would publish recommendations this year .
she added : " the executive has provided funding to projects such as operation reclaim , run by strathclyde police , which creates safe after-school activities for asylum seeker children and children from the host community . "
in response to the call for race awareness training , she said : " public bodies in scotland are subject to a statutory duty to promote race equality .
" we would expect such training to include raising awareness of race equality .
" this is ultimately a matter for individual public bodies and the commission for racial equality as the enforcer of the legislation . "

the kent and canterbury hospital is one of five run by the trust " it 's going to be through natural wastage so we do n't know where the job cuts are going to be , they could be in very key positions .
