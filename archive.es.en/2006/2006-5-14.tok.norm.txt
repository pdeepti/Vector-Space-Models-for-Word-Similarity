kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .

he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .

what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .
the party needs continuity , and that 's what he 'll give it , the 57-year old said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

" germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .

the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .
the party needs continuity , and that 's what he 'll give it , the 57-year old said .
-lrb- april 11 , 2006 -rrb- down-to-earth bridge-builder to lead social democrats kurt beck , state premier of rhineland-palatinate , is said to command respect beyond party lines .
that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party .
-lrb- april 10 , 2006 -rrb- spd leader resigns after five months in office having served as social democratic party chairman for just five months , matthias platzeck will resign from his post .
he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .

" but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .
possession and transportation of the drug are also illegal .
the btmg does not address consumption , thereby making it legal . pot prompts panic attacks tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc - cannabis 's active ingredient - is used in medicine to deal with pain , to alleviate the suffering of aids and cancer patients , but also to fight skin allergies and to treat neurodermatitis .
these methods of treatment , however , are very controversial .
while some people debate the pros and cons of cannabis use in the area of medicine , more and more long-time marijuana smokers have been contacting drug outreach clinics with complaints of burn-out and depression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana can be had by prescription in the netherlands christian stasik , a neurologist based in a small town near cologne , spoke of young people who had said they were overcome by anxiety or panic attacks , constant outbreaks of sweat or racing of the heart . " many of my patients think that people can become mentally ill only by taking hard drugs , " he said .
that has been proven wrong .
smoking pot can provoke particular symptoms .
a study by the mannheim-based central institute of mental health showed that consuming cannabis can prompt schizophrenia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultivation of hash has changed dramatically in recent decades one of the reasons for this development is the progress of technology .
modern machinery , automated watering systems and computer-controlled lighting enable cannabis cultivators to breed plants with greater concentrations of thc .
the pot so popular among hippies in the 1960s normally had a maximal thc content of 8 percent .
nowadays , it is not unusual for marihuana to have a thc-content of 20 percent . while many people consume marijuana because they say it relaxes them , makes them feel euphoric , less anxious or more sexually aroused , studies at the brain research institute at the university of bremen showed that consumption of cannabis during puberty can lead to long-term damage such as memory disturbances and a lack of motivation . golrokh esmaili -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report shows ever more germans addicted to legal substances increasingly , germans are becoming addicted to legal drugs , but the number of deaths from hard drugs fell , a new report says .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .

the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .

her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

" germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- minister 's compulsory kindergarten year proposal draws fire german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has stirred further debate by proposing that kindergarten attendance should be compulsory for every child in germany for at least one year before school .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .

13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .

" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .
the party needs continuity , and that 's what he 'll give it , the 57-year old said .

that 's a quality he 'll need now that he 's been nominated to be the next chairman of germany 's social democratic party .

he said health concerns , including a recent case of acute hearing loss , were behind the decision .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- minister 's compulsory kindergarten year proposal draws fire german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has stirred further debate by proposing that kindergarten attendance should be compulsory for every child in germany for at least one year before school .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot new parenting legislation focuses on fathers german women take the rap for declining birth rate germany 's population problems no longer taboo germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how to choose between kids and a career , but why anyone has to to the delight of florists and chocolate shops around the country , germany is celebrating mother 's day , but behind the scenes of maternal joy , a brutal debate on who does what within the family is still taking place . the discussion started camouflaged as a political debate on family policy and child friendliness , but in reality the core of the question still comes down to what men and women expect of themselves and each other . the sides are taking to the press to draw the battle lines on the front pages of newspapers and magazines .
one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .
the party needs continuity , and that 's what he 'll give it , the 57-year old said .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .

these methods of treatment , however , are very controversial .
while some people debate the pros and cons of cannabis use in the area of medicine , more and more long-time marijuana smokers have been contacting drug outreach clinics with complaints of burn-out and depression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana can be had by prescription in the netherlands christian stasik , a neurologist based in a small town near cologne , spoke of young people who had said they were overcome by anxiety or panic attacks , constant outbreaks of sweat or racing of the heart .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .

the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .
possession and transportation of the drug are also illegal .
the btmg does not address consumption , thereby making it legal . pot prompts panic attacks tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc - cannabis 's active ingredient - is used in medicine to deal with pain , to alleviate the suffering of aids and cancer patients , but also to fight skin allergies and to treat neurodermatitis .
these methods of treatment , however , are very controversial .
while some people debate the pros and cons of cannabis use in the area of medicine , more and more long-time marijuana smokers have been contacting drug outreach clinics with complaints of burn-out and depression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana can be had by prescription in the netherlands christian stasik , a neurologist based in a small town near cologne , spoke of young people who had said they were overcome by anxiety or panic attacks , constant outbreaks of sweat or racing of the heart . " many of my patients think that people can become mentally ill only by taking hard drugs , " he said .
that has been proven wrong .
smoking pot can provoke particular symptoms .
a study by the mannheim-based central institute of mental health showed that consuming cannabis can prompt schizophrenia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultivation of hash has changed dramatically in recent decades one of the reasons for this development is the progress of technology .
modern machinery , automated watering systems and computer-controlled lighting enable cannabis cultivators to breed plants with greater concentrations of thc .
the pot so popular among hippies in the 1960s normally had a maximal thc content of 8 percent .
nowadays , it is not unusual for marihuana to have a thc-content of 20 percent . while many people consume marijuana because they say it relaxes them , makes them feel euphoric , less anxious or more sexually aroused , studies at the brain research institute at the university of bremen showed that consumption of cannabis during puberty can lead to long-term damage such as memory disturbances and a lack of motivation . golrokh esmaili -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report shows ever more germans addicted to legal substances increasingly , germans are becoming addicted to legal drugs , but the number of deaths from hard drugs fell , a new report says .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives . " until then , we will never make it out of the 30 percent hole , " nahles told sunday 's tagesspiegel newspaper . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beck stresses continuity after spd musical chairs kurt beck is set to become the third chairman of the social democrats within only half a year .

one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness . " we will not allow a debate to triumph in germany in which freedom and justice are put in a strange slanted relationship to each other , as if boundless freedom would allow justice to simply fall into place .
that is wrong - we want freedom and justice . " germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany debates the family fewer european couples tying the knot new parenting legislation focuses on fathers german women take the rap for declining birth rate germany 's population problems no longer taboo germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 opinion : mother 's day is n't what it used to be großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question is n't how to choose between kids and a career , but why anyone has to to the delight of florists and chocolate shops around the country , germany is celebrating mother 's day , but behind the scenes of maternal joy , a brutal debate on who does what within the family is still taking place . the discussion started camouflaged as a political debate on family policy and child friendliness , but in reality the core of the question still comes down to what men and women expect of themselves and each other . the sides are taking to the press to draw the battle lines on the front pages of newspapers and magazines .
one side uses expressions like " everyday female heroes , " while the others calls for women to " return to their essence " and points to a well-known news anchor who , shortly after reaching the high-point of her career , lamented how much better it would have been with " five kids and a husband who earns the money . " but all the conservative gentlemen are n't ready to make an example of her yet .
quite the opposite , in fact .
most men would turn and run from the duties of being made the sole provider for a wife and five children . a particularly german phenomenon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each one of these three knows exactly what 's expected the era when mother 's day was a way of showing thanks for the often thankless daily work mothers perform while men deposit a weekly paycheck is over , and the conventional separation of roles in the family no longer applies - with drastic consequences that are clearer in germany than anywhere else . german women have an average of 1.36 children , the lowest rate in europe .
academics in particular have been charged with refusing to bear children . only in germany , where the traditional role of the mother was perverted by the nazis to promote their racist ideology , was the women 's movement starting in the late 1960s so depreciative of traditional mothers and so excessively positive toward working women . kids or career is the difficult and personal choice german women have faced for decades , and it has become the focus of the ideological confrontation .
for years the problem centralized on what women chose , not that they were forced to make a decision at all .
the trenches were dug between the " repressed familial " and the " careerist " archetypes and no one was willing to bring the level of debate back above ground . hard to argue with mother of seven not until statisticians pointed out that declining birth rates would endanger germany 's entire socio-political texture did a slow change in awareness begin .
the first answer to the problem , in true german fashion , was to throw money at it .
more money for social services would push up birth rates .
the efforts were in vain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen wanted men home to raise kids for two months germany 's new family affairs minister , ursula von der leyen , has finally been successful in directing the debate in a different direction - a mother of seven with a doctorate and a cabinet post is hard to contradict when it comes to coordinating a family and a career .
her plan to turn money given to parents from a social benefit to a partial salary replacement during the first year if both parents play a role in actively raising a child moved in the right direction . but it was accusations from conservatives - from throughout the political spectrum - of her getting too involved in parents ' personal decisions and attacking traditional family values that discredited the minister 's untried ideas . the ad-hoc coalition of von der leyen 's opponents got their way , and what resulted can only be called a miscarriage .
the same basic benefits are strewn among all parents like a child-bearing bonus , only a portion of which is determined by income , and an extra special check dropped in the mail when dads decide to take a role in raising their kids . nothing could be worse for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans may ask when mom is coming back there 's nothing that could be worse for the state of germany 's social consciousness than this compromise , for two reasons . first of all , the focus on how much to give parents in the first year is keeping politicians from improving the situation for kids two and up .
twelve months of even the most generous support are n't much good if parents ca n't go back to work because of a lack of daycare places for their 13-month-old . secondly , those defending the conventional family succeeded in thwarting a new , stereotype-free definition of the father 's role in the family .
even if excellent daycare existed , it would n't convince couples to have kids if raising them remains only women 's domain , with the men who choose to take part regarded as exotic exceptions to the rule . germany , in contrast to other european countries , is clearly still facing a long discussion about how to turn raising a child into an actual partnership that does n't require women to choose between kids and a career . uta thofern -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german women take the rap for declining birth rate the government 's family report paints an unexpected picture of contemporary women .
they 're not working as much as they should but that 's not because they 're raising families - they 're just too busy enjoying themselves .
-lrb- april 25 , 2006 -rrb- minister 's compulsory kindergarten year proposal draws fire german family affairs minister ursula von der leyen has stirred further debate by proposing that kindergarten attendance should be compulsory for every child in germany for at least one year before school .
-lrb- april 24 , 2006 -rrb- new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .

" germans are increasingly frustrated that the left-right " grand coalition " has not done more to kick-start europe 's biggest economy and slash the 12 percent jobless rate since taking power in november . a poll released this week by the independent opinion research institute forsa showed that only 40 percent of germans believed merkel 's government was better placed to solve germany 's urgent problems than the center-left administration of her predecessor , gerhard schröder .
the figure was down from 47 percent in november , when optimists hoped the coalition could use its overwhelming majority in parliament to push through bold new measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has lauded her working relationship with platzeck despite the frustration , merkel and her party have fared far better in the polls than the spd , thanks in part to a number of well-received appearances by the chancellor in foreign capitals .
the christian democrats are currently polling at 39 percent - 10 points ahead of the social democrats , according to forsa . the leftist representative on the spd executive board , andrea nahles , said beck must launch a debate on party strategy against the conservatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 social democrats ' new chief vows to outshine merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck : from electrician to party leader germany 's social democrats , partners in chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition , elected powerful state boss kurt beck as their leader sunday as he pledged to help the party emerge from her shadow . beck , the 57-year-old premier of the wine-growing state of rhineland-palatinate , succeeded matthias platzeck , who stepped down in april after just five months at the helm saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown . as party chief , beck becomes the most visible likely challenger to the conservative merkel in the next general election , scheduled for 2009 .
although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- quit over his health " we have quite painful decisions to make with a coalition partner that is not particularly keen to make changes , " merkel told a regional meeting of her christian democrats . beck said sunday it was his party that shaped key recent measures on family benefits , pensions and tax policy in the interest of social justice . " there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness .

although the spd and merkel 's christian democrats are equal partners in the " grand coalition " that took power in november , the social democrats have struggled to sharpen their profile as the chancellor 's popularity has soared . beck told delegates to a one-day party congress in berlin that he would assure the social democrats were seen the defenders of average voters ' interests , before being elected with an overwhelming 95 percent result . " we want to make this society more just , " he said in an 85-minute speech frequently interrupted by applause .
" we can become the decisive force in germany because our ideas are the right ones . "
lots of work ahead faced with a slump in the polls against the conservatives , the spd is seeking a shot in the arm from beck , a gregarious man of the people who was re-elected with a historic absolute majority in a state poll in march . his election as spd leader comes after a week in which tensions between the governing parties boiled over for the first time .
beck , a barrel-chested former electrician , vigorously defended the party against an attack by merkel , who blamed the often fractious social democrats for dragging their feet on key economic reforms .

" there is so much in the coalition agreement that bears our signature that there is no reason at all for us to fear that we will be sidelined , " he said .
beck criticizes merkel and in a speech clearly pitched to the leftist rank-and-file , beck attacked merkel 's frequent championing of freedom as the guiding principle of her policies , saying that government also had a duty to assure fairness .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .

13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .

he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .

" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.05.2006 up-and-coming rabbis choose germany for training großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cologne jewish community is one of the largest in germany , the oldest north of the alps jewish communities in germany estimate they have around 200,000 members - 10 percent more than before the fall of the berlin wall .
with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .
possession and transportation of the drug are also illegal .
the btmg does not address consumption , thereby making it legal . pot prompts panic attacks tetrahydrocannabinol , or thc - cannabis 's active ingredient - is used in medicine to deal with pain , to alleviate the suffering of aids and cancer patients , but also to fight skin allergies and to treat neurodermatitis .
these methods of treatment , however , are very controversial .
while some people debate the pros and cons of cannabis use in the area of medicine , more and more long-time marijuana smokers have been contacting drug outreach clinics with complaints of burn-out and depression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana can be had by prescription in the netherlands christian stasik , a neurologist based in a small town near cologne , spoke of young people who had said they were overcome by anxiety or panic attacks , constant outbreaks of sweat or racing of the heart . " many of my patients think that people can become mentally ill only by taking hard drugs , " he said .
that has been proven wrong .
smoking pot can provoke particular symptoms .
a study by the mannheim-based central institute of mental health showed that consuming cannabis can prompt schizophrenia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultivation of hash has changed dramatically in recent decades one of the reasons for this development is the progress of technology .
modern machinery , automated watering systems and computer-controlled lighting enable cannabis cultivators to breed plants with greater concentrations of thc .
the pot so popular among hippies in the 1960s normally had a maximal thc content of 8 percent .
nowadays , it is not unusual for marihuana to have a thc-content of 20 percent . while many people consume marijuana because they say it relaxes them , makes them feel euphoric , less anxious or more sexually aroused , studies at the brain research institute at the university of bremen showed that consumption of cannabis during puberty can lead to long-term damage such as memory disturbances and a lack of motivation . golrokh esmaili -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report shows ever more germans addicted to legal substances increasingly , germans are becoming addicted to legal drugs , but the number of deaths from hard drugs fell , a new report says .

kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .

" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .

kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .
possession and transportation of the drug are also illegal .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .
so it will be a physical challenge for the visitor . bildunterschrift : robert morris : " labyrinth " the gugge n heim exhibitio n ru n s from july 21 , 2006 to ja n . 7 , 2007 . christine harjes interviewed kay heymer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum as the cathedral of the 21st century a museum of contemporary art in the german city of düsseldorf has been chosen as the first stop of a traveling exhibition which explores the fascinating development of museum architecture in the 21st century .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said .

he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .

he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .

in an interview with dw-world.de , one of the project managers talks about the guggenheim 's appeal and the exhibit 's concept . the gugge n heim collectio n with its fasci n ati n g history has n ever before bee n prese n ted so exte n sively .
preparatio n s for the exhibitio n at the art a n d exhibitio n hall of germa n y i n bo n n are goi n g full steam ahead .
the effort has bee n e n ormous .
four curators - two i n bo n n a n d two i n new york - have bee n worki n g o n a co n cept a n d impleme n ti n g it for over a year .
kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .

kay heymer is o n e of the project ma n agers . dw-world.de : the gugge n heim collectio n is o n e of the most famous of its ki n d i n the world .
what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .
the large hall in particular , in which tom krens for the first time can give an insight into the guggenheim 's very large collection of minimal art .
the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .
and berlin 's national gallery ca n't offer that much space . how were the i n dividual pieces chose n for the exhibitio n ? we worked very closely with our colleagues in new york .
we started with the rooms we have available .
we developed a specific architecture from these very clear and simple rooms and then filled them according to the concept .
we combined the individual artists on the one hand with the collection 's history and also the art historical aspects , in order to enable a chronological course through the guggenheim foundation . which piece do you fi n d particularly outsta n di n g ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard serra : " strike " one can generally say that the guggenheim museum has a large number of true masterpieces .
i personally like the room with richard serra very much , where there 's a significant early sculpture from 1970 .
it 's an iron plate which is seven meters -lrb- 23 feet -rrb- long and 2.5 meters high , weighs eight tons and which will be very complicated to get into the building here .
it 's called " strike . " what sort of experie n ce ca n the visitor take home with them ? in the ideal case , the visitor has seen how fascinating and alive art of the 20th and early 21st century is .
and that the observer can see this art not only with his eyes , but it can include and appeal to his entire body .
art can be a very sensuous experience .
take the labyrinth by robert morris , for example .
this piece has a nine-meter diameter and is four meters high .
the visitor can go through very tight aisles to get to the center of the labyrinth .
and he will certainly need 20 to 30 minutes to deal with this piece .

what makes the gugge n heim museum so successful ? kay heymer : the guggenheim museum distinguishes itself through the fact that it is a very personal museum .
the collectors which contributed to the museum 's development were all very eccentric personalities .
it started with the founding director hilla von rebay , a german painter who strongly promoted abstract painting .
later , the focus of the guggenheim museum was strongly expanded and other personalities played a major role : on the one hand , the directors , such as tom krens today , and on the other hand , private collectors , like the thannhauser couple or later peggy guggenheim , solomon guggenheim 's niece .
she strongly supported surrealism and american abstract expressionism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in new york was designed by frank lloyd wright the character of the guggenheim museum is very selective .
it is n't a collection which functions like an encyclopedia , like the museum of modern art , which gives an overview of artistic development in the 20th century .
guggenheim collected much more subjectively .
there were a few artists he concentrated on , who were then extensively collected .
the museum owns , for example , 160 pieces alone from kandinsky , or over 60 works by paul klee . what disti n guishes the bo n n exhibit ? we have tried to reflect in the exhibition 's concept how the structure of the guggenheim collection developed and what distinguishes it .
so , we have rooms which can be seen historically , such as the " peggy guggenheim collection " and surrealism , or a room on post-impressionism , which is owed to the thannhauser collection .
on the other hand , we 've installed monographic rooms , in which only works from one artist are exhibited .
so we have a picasso room , two kandinsky rooms , a room with robert rauschenberg and a room only for richard serra . why was bo n n chose n for this exhibit , i n stead of berli n , which hosted the moma exhibit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kay heymer with a model of the exhibition of course , bonn is a smaller city than berlin .
but bonn has a larger art museum .
tom krens was mainly interested in the many square meters available to us .

the guggenheim exhibit here in bonn will cover some 8,000 square meters -lrb- 86,000 square feet -rrb- .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .
13 and 14 , 2006 , three rabbis will be ordained in the dresden synagogue .
the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program . " it 's like a double degree , " said first-semester student adrian schell . the students complete a regular master 's studies program in jewish studies at the university . " in addition , we receive training at the kolleg in berlin to become rabbis , " schell said .
" we learn how to approach the holy writings . "
bildunterschrift : the new jewish synagogue in berlin attracts bright , young rabbis the seminarians are also instructed in questions concerning everyday life . " we learn how to lead people in the life cycle and in liturgical worship , " he said .
" even if we all have different singing abilities , we have to learn the basics . " schell attends classes in philosophy , history , bible studies , religious history and pastoral theology at the university of potsdam .
he visits courses in psychology and counseling , and receives language training . all of the prospective rabbis read the torah and the talmud - the central writings of judaism - in hebrew and aramaic .
however , all classes are held in german . the germa n dilemma the seminarians sometimes find it problematic to be educated in german , and to be receiving their training in the country that gave rise to the holocaust .
in the beginning , people were quite skeptical and cautious about having future rabbis educated in germany , kolleg rector walter homolka said .
and doubts continue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue -lrb- same as above -rrb- was devastated by the nazis on kristallnacht in 1938 " one dutch colleague said that he could n't forgive me for teaching the torah here among the ashes of the six million jews who died in the holocaust , " homolka said .
" on the other hand , pragmatically speaking , this was the only possible choice .
i think the fact that we are training future rabbis here will have a multiple effect - the seminarians can contribute to the development of a modern image of germany in jewish communities around the world . " liberal judaism , n o tuitio n the abraham geiger kolleg is considered an educational institute of liberal , non-orthodox judaism - a current whose development , particularly in the scientific area , had a great deal of influence on central european jews of the 19th century , homolka said . " the efforts of german jews to gain recognition here as citizens , yet continue to live out their jewish traditions - that was a very german issue , " he said .
" and that is why this movement developed so much in these areas : in austria , hungary and germany . " as early as the 19th century , the berlin-based rabbi abraham geiger - a theologian after whom the kolleg is named - tried to establish a course in jewish theology at a german university .
but it was not until 1999 , with the founding of the abraham geiger kolleg as part of the universtiy of potsdam , that it finally became possible to prepare for a career as a jewish spiritual leader within a pluralistic atmosphere of academic freedom as offered by a university .
in contrast , only jews attend a seminary for rabbis . but there is also one very pragmatic reason for training to become a rabbi at the abraham geiger institute in germany : unlike in the united states and england , students do not have to pay tuition at berlin and potsdam universities . lydia heller -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin museum celebrates " chrismukka " this year hanukkah and christmas are celebrated in the same week , and the jewish museum is using the occasion to show how the two religious celebrations have evolved - and even found touching points here and there .

with only 23 rabbis to lead them , more religious leaders are needed . immigrant jews from eastern europe are the primary shapers of modern jewish life in germany .
until recently , rabbis in germany were mainly trained in the united states , israel or england .
that has changed .
on sept .

the three were educated at the abraham geiger college in potsdam , outside of berlin .
it is the only institute of its kind in germany and the first seminary to be established for rabbis in central europe since the holocaust . practice is a must hands-on work in the jewish communities is required of the up-and-coming jewish leaders .
they are from ukraine , the czech republic , russia , sweden and even south africa .
to become rabbis , they must complete an impressive , five-year program .

but the consequences of its use are underestimated , particularly by teenagers , who are starting to consume it at an ever younger age . sebastian is a 36-year-old sitting down to lunch in a popular restaurant in cologne .
he lights up a joint , as he puts it , " to relax from work . "
the restaurant is in a hip part of town , so he says no one even notices his pot-smoking .
" i do n't look like a junkie hanging around the train station , " he says . erkan is 24 years old , tall and athletic .
he is a car salesman , loves to play soccer and has been a regular marihuana-smoker for years .
he does not believe he is addicted : " you ca n't get addicted to smoking pot as long as you exercise enough .
having a proper job keeps you from getting addicted , too . "
he believes only people who do not make the most out of their lives become addicted to drugs . pot-smoking is permitted cannabis is one of the most frequently consumed drugs in germany .
according to the federal statistics office , 26 percent of the 18-to-59 year-old germans surveyed admitted to having consumed cannabis at least once in their lives .
the biggest group to use the drug were young adults : nearly 50 percent of 18-to-24 year-olds have consumed the substance at least once .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis can be consumed in a variety of ways federal drug commissioner sabine bätzing recently presented a national report on drugs and addiction which stated that young people are starting to smoke marijuana at an increasingly younger age .
" the younger they begin to consume , the greater the risk of psychological addiction , " the report said .
the age at which most young people start to smoke pot is 16 .
the report said that around 400,000 people in germany are addicted to or consume too much marijuana . actually , smoking pot has never even been legally banned in germany .
according to the law governing narcotics , the " btmg , " those who " cultivate , manufacture , trade or import , export , divest , distribute or otherwise bring narcotics -lrb- i.e. cannabis -rrb- into circulation without trading them or those who buy or otherwise acquire them " can be punished .
possession and transportation of the drug are also illegal .

an american company is to take on the marketing of the mosquito device , which was developed in merthyr tydfil .
the mosquito emits a high-pitched noise that can only be heard by young people and has a record of driving gangs away from trouble spots .
more than 1,000 of the boxes have been sold , including to police forces .
until now , compound security system 's -lrb- css -rrb- mosquito box launched in january has been manufactured in cardiff at the rate of 120 units a week .
but demand has already started to outstrip supply , and the company has signed a deal with cwmbran-based fulleon to take over the production . "
it 's not an all out assault that makes a teenager fall to their ground clasping their head . "
css director simon morris fulleon 's texas parent company cooper-menvier have also signed a global distribution deal which according to css will net them £ 1.5m in the first year .
" we have negotiated a very healthy royalty in sales , " said simon morris , director of css .
" we are now launching another security-related project within the next few months . "
interest in the mosquito has already come from holland where a separate distribution deal has been agreed and now the firm sees new markets opening up in canada , america and the far east , said mr morris , he said the metropolitan police had bought 33 mosquito units and also among its customers was a nottingham pizza operation , which he said , had not had a single problem with troublesome youths since installing the device .
the mosquito was invented by howard stapleton last august after his 14-year-old daughter returned empty-handed from a trip to the shop because of the rowdy teenagers outside .
" as a father i realise the majority of young people are fun-loving and law abiding , " said mr stapleton .
' threatens business ' " i find it sad that a system is needed to combat lawlessness but its proven effectiveness shows how much it is needed to improve our communities . "
there have been some complaints that the device breached human rights of young people as it was " indiscriminate " .
but mr morris said they had spent £ 25,000 in the last two months looking into the matter , and they were happy they were not breaching human rights nor any environmental laws .
he said the noise given out by the box , which costs about £ 500 , was audible over five to 10 minutes to most teenagers but not all .
" it 's not an all out assault that makes a teenager fall to their ground clasping their head . "
robert campbell of fulleon said : " we recognise the mosquito is an innovative product that serves the needs of customers as well as communities .
