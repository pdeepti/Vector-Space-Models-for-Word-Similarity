new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .
-lrb- march 28 , 2006 -rrb- eu commission to supervise german spending germany 's new finance minister peer steinbrück is making waves by suggesting an unusual way of avoiding eu sanctions which brussels could impose over berlin 's non-compliance with the stability pact .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .
" the swiss might relax , thinking they just need a draw .
it could give us a chance to put them under pressure .
we will not need to look at the result of the france-togo game . " hakan yakin made a big impact when he came on as a replacement in the 2-0 triumph over togo and the attacking midfielder is confident that switzerland will not underestimate south korea or play for the draw .
" it 's definitely an advantage for us now that we do n't have to beat south korea , " said yakin , who is now injury-free after a long spell on the sidelines . " it could also be dangerous though because the koreans need to win .
it 's no good us playing for a draw because we saw during their draw with france how dangerous they can be in the last 10 minutes .

meanwhile france will meet togo in cologne without suspended skipper zinedine zidane .
but keeper fabien barthez has urged his teammates to forget about the suspended zizou and get on with the job " we ca n't let his absence get us down , we 've got to think about getting a result , think about our game with or without him , " said barthez .
" there 's no room for feelings like that - it 's up to us to adapt . " despite two lethargic performances to date , the goalkeeper insists france are still on track .
" we 're still on target to win the world cup , " a bullish barthez insisted . france are out to erase the memory of their humiliating title defense when they crashed out in the first round four years ago without scoring a goal , but barthez said fear of a repeat debacle four years on was not on their minds . " you should never have fear , you should never have regrets .
you do n't get small teams in the world cup anymore , like you had 10 or 20 years ago , " said barthez , " you ca n't be concerned , you 've got to remain confident and think about winning .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .
" the swiss might relax , thinking they just need a draw .
it could give us a chance to put them under pressure .
we will not need to look at the result of the france-togo game . " hakan yakin made a big impact when he came on as a replacement in the 2-0 triumph over togo and the attacking midfielder is confident that switzerland will not underestimate south korea or play for the draw .
" it 's definitely an advantage for us now that we do n't have to beat south korea , " said yakin , who is now injury-free after a long spell on the sidelines . " it could also be dangerous though because the koreans need to win .
it 's no good us playing for a draw because we saw during their draw with france how dangerous they can be in the last 10 minutes . " the first ever match between the two countries could develop into a battle of wits between south korea 's coach dick advocaat and his opposite number kobi kuhn , who have been hailed as tactical geniuses for their match-altering substitutions . former champions having to dig deep to progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of zidane 's international career ?
meanwhile france will meet togo in cologne without suspended skipper zinedine zidane .
but keeper fabien barthez has urged his teammates to forget about the suspended zizou and get on with the job " we ca n't let his absence get us down , we 've got to think about getting a result , think about our game with or without him , " said barthez .
" there 's no room for feelings like that - it 's up to us to adapt . " despite two lethargic performances to date , the goalkeeper insists france are still on track .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2006 opinion : bush 's freedom speech fell flat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush delivered his speech on budapest 's gellert hill with his speech in budapest on thursday , us president george w. bush attempted to latch onto an american tradition of great orations on freedom , but it did n't quite work out that way , says dw 's miodrag soric . john f. kennedy , jimmy carter , ronald reagan : all of these american presidents delivered speeches in europe on the topic of freedom .
above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .

qualified spain are so relaxed that fernando torres and others will sit out the saudi arabia game . andriy shevchenko 's timely return to form in ukraine 's 4-0 thrashing of saudi arabia was one of many plus points from a game that has revived the world cup debutants ' campaign to qualify for the last 16 . ukraine , who lost 4-0 to spain in their opener , showed their attacking intent against a toothless saudi team from the start . the match represented a personal triumph for shevchenko , the striker leading the way with a fine individual performance and combining fantastically with attacking team-mates maksym kalinichenko , serhiy rebrov and oleg rusov . it was pressure from shevchenko that forced saudi arabia into conceding the corner from which andriy rusol scored the opening the goal in the fourth minute . shevchenko then opened his own account one minute into the second-half , rising above defender hamad al-montashari to head a home a kalinichenko free-kick and turned provider for the fourth goal , setting up kalinichenko with a beautifully-weighted cross past a despairing mabrouk zaid in goal and three defenders . big win over saudis boosts ukraine 's chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's andriy rusol got the ball and the goals rolling so emphatic was the score line , in fact , that it immediately revived ukraine 's chances of reaching the last 16 , leaving them two points clear of both tunisia and the saudis with a superior goal difference , and within another win of achieving their objective . shevchenko said there was a huge psychological difference between the spain game and that against saudi arabia .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate . " but both german intelligence and the bka have denied that " sam " works for either body and said they could prove that the man identified by el-masri was in germany at the time of his abduction . does germany sanction torture ? while one burning question at thursday 's hearing was the identity of " sam , " another was the extent of german authorities ' involvement in the case . wolfgang neskovic , the left party 's member of the oversight committee , said that the basic principle at stake was whether germany was willing to sanction torture as a tool in the war on terror . so far , the committee 's findings have been neutral . " there 's still no proof that german authorities were involved in the incident , " said thomas opermann from the investigation committee . injustice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri broke down during the hearing but el-masri 's attorney has argued otherwise . " if it turns out that german authorities were involved , then it would n't be up to us to demand action .
what happened was a huge injustice , " said his lawyer , manfred gnjidic . el-masri says he was kidnapped while in macedonia in late 2003 and then transferred to a cia-run prison in afghanistan where he was held for four months .
after his release he says he was dumped in albania . recalling his ordeal , el-masri struggled to contain himself and asked for a break in questioning . opposition mps are outraged by his account . " he was kidnapped , and interrogated under horrible conditions in afghanistan after being questioned in macedonia , " said hans-christian ströbele from the green party . the inquiry is scheduled to meet again next thursday to continue looking into el-masri 's allegations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

there is no genuine playmaker to replace zidane in a four-man midfield on the right side of which exciting newcomer franck ribery will start a match for france for the second time .
mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .

mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .
not even the entrance of brazilian born star striker dos santos with 11 minutes left could ratchet up the pace . spain beat saudi-arabia to win group h in the other group h game , a spanish team with much of their first string resting on the bench beat saudi-arabia in kaiserslautern to defend their top slot in the group . spain and ukraine 's next opponents will be decided in friday 's final set of group round matches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2006 opinion : bush 's freedom speech fell flat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush delivered his speech on budapest 's gellert hill with his speech in budapest on thursday , us president george w. bush attempted to latch onto an american tradition of great orations on freedom , but it did n't quite work out that way , says dw 's miodrag soric . john f. kennedy , jimmy carter , ronald reagan : all of these american presidents delivered speeches in europe on the topic of freedom .
above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 23.06.2006 a sleeping pill of a game sees ukraine stumble forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine celebrate their trip to world cup 's the round of 16 the ukrainian and tunisian fans who came to berlin hoping to see their team advance were given a poor show as ukraine , with the help of a penalty , managed an uneventful 1-0 victory to see them through to the last 16 . the ukraine were seen as favorites to win this game , and so they did , but not without some luck . anis ayari hit a free-kick in the 64th minute for tunisia that was deflected just over the crossbar by a ukrainian hand in the wall .
that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .
not even the entrance of brazilian born star striker dos santos with 11 minutes left could ratchet up the pace . spain beat saudi-arabia to win group h in the other group h game , a spanish team with much of their first string resting on the bench beat saudi-arabia in kaiserslautern to defend their top slot in the group . spain and ukraine 's next opponents will be decided in friday 's final set of group round matches .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .

the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate . " but both german intelligence and the bka have denied that " sam " works for either body and said they could prove that the man identified by el-masri was in germany at the time of his abduction . does germany sanction torture ? while one burning question at thursday 's hearing was the identity of " sam , " another was the extent of german authorities ' involvement in the case . wolfgang neskovic , the left party 's member of the oversight committee , said that the basic principle at stake was whether germany was willing to sanction torture as a tool in the war on terror . so far , the committee 's findings have been neutral . " there 's still no proof that german authorities were involved in the incident , " said thomas opermann from the investigation committee . injustice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri broke down during the hearing but el-masri 's attorney has argued otherwise . " if it turns out that german authorities were involved , then it would n't be up to us to demand action .
what happened was a huge injustice , " said his lawyer , manfred gnjidic . el-masri says he was kidnapped while in macedonia in late 2003 and then transferred to a cia-run prison in afghanistan where he was held for four months .
after his release he says he was dumped in albania . recalling his ordeal , el-masri struggled to contain himself and asked for a break in questioning . opposition mps are outraged by his account . " he was kidnapped , and interrogated under horrible conditions in afghanistan after being questioned in macedonia , " said hans-christian ströbele from the green party . the inquiry is scheduled to meet again next thursday to continue looking into el-masri 's allegations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

the group h clash will decide who joins likely group winners spain in the knockout stage .
tunisia need a win to make virtually certain they claim the second spot while ukraine are likely to require only a draw .
dw-world.de will give you all the action from the game between ukraine , world cup debutants , and tunisia , looking for their first win in a world cup game since 1978 .
we will also give you highlights from the other group h game between saudi-arabia and spain .
the line-ups .
ukraine -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 1-oleksander shovkovsky ; 6-andriy rusol , 22-vyacheslav svidersky , 2-andriy nesmachny ; 9-oleg gusev , 4-anatoly tymoshchyuk , 8-oleg shelayev , 19-maxim kalinichenko , 11-serhiy rebrov ; 7-andriy shevchenko , 10-andriy voronin coach : oleg blokhin tunisia -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : 1-ali boumnijel ; 6-hatem trabelsi , 15-radhi jaidi , 3-karim hagui , 19-anis ayari ; 20-hamed namouchi , 12-joahar mnari , 14-adel chedli , 8-medhi nafti , 13-riadh bouazizi ; 5-ziad jaziri coach : roger lemerre referee : carlos amarilla -lrb- paraguay -rrb- about ten minutes to kick-off .
tunisia again have to start without their injured striker dos santos .
the players are entering the pitch .
the blue and yellow fans of ukraine are dancing and singing .
they are in majority but part of the stadium is red and waving the tunisian flag .
the anthems have been played .
the players shake hands .
1. min .
tunisia kick off .
1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .
jaidi screws up outside the box for voronin to steal the ball .
the ukraine comes two against one but voronin 's pass is sloppy .
4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .
nafti almost finds jaziri running into the box .
7. min .
ukraine have managed to get a small grip on the events but both teams have started rather carefully and mistakes are not few on either side .
8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .
13. min .
trabelsi again .
the tunisian gets the ball down at the right flag and dribbles his way into the box where he loses the ball .
13. min .
jaidi gets a shot but it flies high over shovkovsky 's goal .
15. min .
a wall pass opens up the tunisian defense and creates some confusion that leads to a free-kick for the ukrainians .
shevchenko hits it far though .
17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .
if one of the teams decided to raise the tempo they would probably give the opponents such a shock they would n't understand what happened .
21. min .
at last some action .
the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .
it looks as he is past his two defenders but somehow loses the ball before having a chance to finish .
33. min .
tunisians combine nicely .
no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .
37. min .
the ukrainians are walking the thinner line .
if tunisia were to score it could prove fatal as it might be hard to switch pace later .
38. min .
jaidi seem to have hurt himself suddenly .
the tunisian defender limps to the sideline 39. min .
trabelsi gets a good cross in from the right and it lands in front of goal between two ukrainians and jaziri who ca n't reach it .
trabelsi has been the one tunisian player who stands out a bit .
42. min .
some booing and whistling reach the pitch .
42. min .
bouazizi booked .
44. min .
shevchenko fiddles about with the ball in the box .
has someone put sleeping pills in the water bottles around the pitch ? 45 + 1. min .
jaziri leaves the pitch after an attack on shelayev .
45 + 1. min .
first half ends .
shelayev rockets a shot from twenty five meters just before the sending off of jaziri .
the shot is the last -lrb- and almost only -rrb- real attempt on goal in this boring first half .
the players are back on the pitch .
let 's hope it 's a better second half .
45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .
the teams are still impersonating the living dead .
50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .
52. min .
more unhappy whistling from the stands .
the ukrainian fans are wondering why no one is in the tunisian box when the cross comes flying in .
54. min .
rebrov leaves for vorobey .
56. min .
trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures a nation expects dw-world.de presents germany 's 2006 world cup squad .

the french must win to go through while switzerland and south-korea could reach the last sixteen with a draw , although it 's unlikely any of the teams will want to risk playing for such a result .
the line-ups .
togo -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 16-kossi agassa ; 2-dare nibombe , 3-jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , 5-massamesso tchangai ; 13-richmond forson , 7-moustapha salifou , 18-yao junior senaya , 10-cherif toure mamam , 6-yao aziawanou ; 4-emmanuel adebayor , 17-mohamed kader coubadja .

there is no genuine playmaker to replace zidane in a four-man midfield on the right side of which exciting newcomer franck ribery will start a match for france for the second time .
mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .
the players are in the tunnel .
the teams take the pitch .

1. min .
the french will certainly try to get an early goal .
they start off in a good tempo and sagnol gets the first cross .
3. min .
the french are high up .
first chance is trzeguet 's .
the striker gets the ball just inside the box and turns to shoot .
his ball goes a meter wide .
5. min .
the french will have to watch out though .
it is never easy to play a team who has nothing to lose .
6. min .
trzeguet again .
ribery hits in the cross from the left and trezeguet heads it hard .
agassa gets a hand on it and tips it over the bar .
8. min .
a fast counter attack by togo gives barthez in the french goal a first opportunity to show himself .
10. min .
the game is leveling out .
the first minutes of french dominance have given way to a more even game .
11. min .

trezeguet 's goal is offside .
the french striker gets the ball from ribery inside the box and scores before realizing he 's offside .
17. min .

the togolese are dangerous though when they get a chance to counter , something they do at high speed .
19. min .
the togolese have had it fairly easy to break the french attack , which gives the africans possibilities to counter over and over again .
21. min .
trezeguet again .
ribery has started the match well and hits another opener for trezeguet who should have finished better .
the ball is no problem for agassa .
22. min .
silvestre tries agassa with a half volley .
the pressure is there , the chances too but no goal .
25. min .
mamam tries a cross towards the middle but there are no togolese there .
27. min .
salifou comes in from the left and fires a shot that barthez ca n't hold at first .
the french goalie jumps forward to pull the ball back in .
27. min .
ribery brings the ball down the togolese field and gets a great chance to score .
his shot flies high over the goal though .
28. min .
makelele gets booked .
29. min .
mamam 's free-kick outside the french box is too high .
31. min .
a ball from ribery sails in to the box and is headed over the end line by nibombe just before trezeguet gets a chance to put his head on the ball .
35. min .
trezeguet gets a ball to run for but again the french striker is caught offside .
this time it 's very close .
37. min .

39. min .

43. min .

the togolese holds on to vieira in the mid circle .
45. min .
the togolese must be happy going into the break with a 0-0 .
45 + 1. min .
a lovely cross from malouda is headed out by nibombe who 's perfectly placed in front of trezeguet and henry both waiting to score .
45 + 1. min .
first half is over .
the french have piled up chances but no goal .
the togolese will have a tough second half but are also pretty cool in defense and make use of their counters , which have given the africans a handful of decent chances .
as it stands , a 0-1 for the french will be enough to see them trough thanks to the swiss leading korea 1-0 .
question is if france will have the mental strength to deliver .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .

that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .

kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .

90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 23.06.2006 a sleeping pill of a game sees ukraine stumble forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine celebrate their trip to world cup 's the round of 16 the ukrainian and tunisian fans who came to berlin hoping to see their team advance were given a poor show as ukraine , with the help of a penalty , managed an uneventful 1-0 victory to see them through to the last 16 . the ukraine were seen as favorites to win this game , and so they did , but not without some luck . anis ayari hit a free-kick in the 64th minute for tunisia that was deflected just over the crossbar by a ukrainian hand in the wall .
that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .

their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .
" the swiss might relax , thinking they just need a draw .
it could give us a chance to put them under pressure .
we will not need to look at the result of the france-togo game . " hakan yakin made a big impact when he came on as a replacement in the 2-0 triumph over togo and the attacking midfielder is confident that switzerland will not underestimate south korea or play for the draw .
" it 's definitely an advantage for us now that we do n't have to beat south korea , " said yakin , who is now injury-free after a long spell on the sidelines . " it could also be dangerous though because the koreans need to win .
it 's no good us playing for a draw because we saw during their draw with france how dangerous they can be in the last 10 minutes . " the first ever match between the two countries could develop into a battle of wits between south korea 's coach dick advocaat and his opposite number kobi kuhn , who have been hailed as tactical geniuses for their match-altering substitutions . former champions having to dig deep to progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of zidane 's international career ?
meanwhile france will meet togo in cologne without suspended skipper zinedine zidane .
but keeper fabien barthez has urged his teammates to forget about the suspended zizou and get on with the job " we ca n't let his absence get us down , we 've got to think about getting a result , think about our game with or without him , " said barthez .
" there 's no room for feelings like that - it 's up to us to adapt . " despite two lethargic performances to date , the goalkeeper insists france are still on track .
" we 're still on target to win the world cup , " a bullish barthez insisted . france are out to erase the memory of their humiliating title defense when they crashed out in the first round four years ago without scoring a goal , but barthez said fear of a repeat debacle four years on was not on their minds . " you should never have fear , you should never have regrets .
you do n't get small teams in the world cup anymore , like you had 10 or 20 years ago , " said barthez , " you ca n't be concerned , you 've got to remain confident and think about winning .
that 's all ! " if france fail to qualify it means the last image of zidane , who is retiring after the finals , wearing a france shirt was of the player throwing his sweatband down on the ground in frustration at his injury time substitution against south korea . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france face possible elimination after korean fightback france 's ineffectual world cup campaign failed again to spark in leipzig despite taking an early lead and showing a modicum of desire against south korea .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .
" the swiss might relax , thinking they just need a draw .
it could give us a chance to put them under pressure .
we will not need to look at the result of the france-togo game . " hakan yakin made a big impact when he came on as a replacement in the 2-0 triumph over togo and the attacking midfielder is confident that switzerland will not underestimate south korea or play for the draw .
" it 's definitely an advantage for us now that we do n't have to beat south korea , " said yakin , who is now injury-free after a long spell on the sidelines . " it could also be dangerous though because the koreans need to win .
it 's no good us playing for a draw because we saw during their draw with france how dangerous they can be in the last 10 minutes . " the first ever match between the two countries could develop into a battle of wits between south korea 's coach dick advocaat and his opposite number kobi kuhn , who have been hailed as tactical geniuses for their match-altering substitutions . former champions having to dig deep to progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of zidane 's international career ?
meanwhile france will meet togo in cologne without suspended skipper zinedine zidane .
but keeper fabien barthez has urged his teammates to forget about the suspended zizou and get on with the job " we ca n't let his absence get us down , we 've got to think about getting a result , think about our game with or without him , " said barthez .
" there 's no room for feelings like that - it 's up to us to adapt . " despite two lethargic performances to date , the goalkeeper insists france are still on track .
" we 're still on target to win the world cup , " a bullish barthez insisted . france are out to erase the memory of their humiliating title defense when they crashed out in the first round four years ago without scoring a goal , but barthez said fear of a repeat debacle four years on was not on their minds . " you should never have fear , you should never have regrets .
you do n't get small teams in the world cup anymore , like you had 10 or 20 years ago , " said barthez , " you ca n't be concerned , you 've got to remain confident and think about winning .
that 's all ! " if france fail to qualify it means the last image of zidane , who is retiring after the finals , wearing a france shirt was of the player throwing his sweatband down on the ground in frustration at his injury time substitution against south korea . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france face possible elimination after korean fightback france 's ineffectual world cup campaign failed again to spark in leipzig despite taking an early lead and showing a modicum of desire against south korea .

qualified spain are so relaxed that fernando torres and others will sit out the saudi arabia game . andriy shevchenko 's timely return to form in ukraine 's 4-0 thrashing of saudi arabia was one of many plus points from a game that has revived the world cup debutants ' campaign to qualify for the last 16 . ukraine , who lost 4-0 to spain in their opener , showed their attacking intent against a toothless saudi team from the start . the match represented a personal triumph for shevchenko , the striker leading the way with a fine individual performance and combining fantastically with attacking team-mates maksym kalinichenko , serhiy rebrov and oleg rusov . it was pressure from shevchenko that forced saudi arabia into conceding the corner from which andriy rusol scored the opening the goal in the fourth minute . shevchenko then opened his own account one minute into the second-half , rising above defender hamad al-montashari to head a home a kalinichenko free-kick and turned provider for the fourth goal , setting up kalinichenko with a beautifully-weighted cross past a despairing mabrouk zaid in goal and three defenders . big win over saudis boosts ukraine 's chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's andriy rusol got the ball and the goals rolling so emphatic was the score line , in fact , that it immediately revived ukraine 's chances of reaching the last 16 , leaving them two points clear of both tunisia and the saudis with a superior goal difference , and within another win of achieving their objective . shevchenko said there was a huge psychological difference between the spain game and that against saudi arabia .
" during the first game we were overawed by the occasion , " he said .
" we let in two goals from free-kicks , then came the sending off , but monday was a completely different story .
we went ahead almost immediately and played aggressive , flowing football . " confidence restored , ukraine now know that the incentive could not be any greater when they face tunisia in berlin , and shevchenko made no attempt to downplay the game 's significance . " the match against tunisia will be decisive , " he admitted .
" everything now hinges on friday 's result . " now at their fourth world cup finals , tunisia are still seeking a first win since a 3-1 victory over mexico in their 1978 debut in argentina .
they have played 10 matches since then . the tunisians have no injuries concerns for the match , aside from striker francileudo dos santos who is still seeing a specialist over his shin injury .

" torres has come to the tournament in great form , i hope he continues like this and that is why he is going to be rested for the next game , " the coach told reporters . spain lead the group with six points and a goal difference of plus six , ukraine are second on three points while tunisia and saudi arabia have one each . aragones 's men will meet switzerland , south korea or france in the last 16 . " i do n't have any preferences , " said spain 's coach .
" france do n't appear to be in very good physical shape but can cause us problems because they are very experienced and know what the world cup is all about . " " switzerland are a young side like us , they play good football and they are very strong on the break .
korea , well , they run like devils .

the french must win to go through while switzerland and south-korea could reach the last sixteen with a draw , although it 's unlikely any of the teams will want to risk playing for such a result .
the line-ups .
togo -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 16-kossi agassa ; 2-dare nibombe , 3-jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , 5-massamesso tchangai ; 13-richmond forson , 7-moustapha salifou , 18-yao junior senaya , 10-cherif toure mamam , 6-yao aziawanou ; 4-emmanuel adebayor , 17-mohamed kader coubadja .
coach : otto pfister france -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 16-fabien barthez ; 19-willy sagnol , 15-lilian thuram , 5-william gallas , 13-mikael silvestre ; 22-franck ribery , 4-patrick vieira , 6-claude makelele , 7-florent malouda ; 20-david trezeguet , 12-thierry henry coach : raymond domenech referee : jorge larrionda -lrb- uruguay -rrb- france coach raymond domenech , missing playmaker zinedine zidane and defender eric abidal through suspension , paired david trezeguet with thierry henry in attack for a game the french must win by two clear goals to make sure of reaching the last 16 of the world cup .
there is no genuine playmaker to replace zidane in a four-man midfield on the right side of which exciting newcomer franck ribery will start a match for france for the second time .
mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .
the players are in the tunnel .
the teams take the pitch .
the crowd roars a welcome that quickly changes into peace as the anthems begin .
a long strip of yellow togo fans run along the side of the field but the blue fans of france are in majority under the roof in cologne .
1. min .
the french kick-off .
1. min .
the french will certainly try to get an early goal .
they start off in a good tempo and sagnol gets the first cross .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate . " but both german intelligence and the bka have denied that " sam " works for either body and said they could prove that the man identified by el-masri was in germany at the time of his abduction . does germany sanction torture ? while one burning question at thursday 's hearing was the identity of " sam , " another was the extent of german authorities ' involvement in the case . wolfgang neskovic , the left party 's member of the oversight committee , said that the basic principle at stake was whether germany was willing to sanction torture as a tool in the war on terror . so far , the committee 's findings have been neutral .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate . " but both german intelligence and the bka have denied that " sam " works for either body and said they could prove that the man identified by el-masri was in germany at the time of his abduction . does germany sanction torture ? while one burning question at thursday 's hearing was the identity of " sam , " another was the extent of german authorities ' involvement in the case . wolfgang neskovic , the left party 's member of the oversight committee , said that the basic principle at stake was whether germany was willing to sanction torture as a tool in the war on terror . so far , the committee 's findings have been neutral . " there 's still no proof that german authorities were involved in the incident , " said thomas opermann from the investigation committee . injustice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri broke down during the hearing but el-masri 's attorney has argued otherwise . " if it turns out that german authorities were involved , then it would n't be up to us to demand action .
what happened was a huge injustice , " said his lawyer , manfred gnjidic . el-masri says he was kidnapped while in macedonia in late 2003 and then transferred to a cia-run prison in afghanistan where he was held for four months .
after his release he says he was dumped in albania . recalling his ordeal , el-masri struggled to contain himself and asked for a break in questioning . opposition mps are outraged by his account . " he was kidnapped , and interrogated under horrible conditions in afghanistan after being questioned in macedonia , " said hans-christian ströbele from the green party . the inquiry is scheduled to meet again next thursday to continue looking into el-masri 's allegations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german testifies in probe into alleged cia abduction a parliamentary probe hears testimony from a german citizen , khaled al-masri , who alleged he was kidnapped by the cia and held for five months in an afghan jail .

" confidence restored , ukraine now know that the incentive could not be any greater when they face tunisia in berlin , and shevchenko made no attempt to downplay the game 's significance . " the match against tunisia will be decisive , " he admitted .
" everything now hinges on friday 's result . " now at their fourth world cup finals , tunisia are still seeking a first win since a 3-1 victory over mexico in their 1978 debut in argentina .
they have played 10 matches since then . the tunisians have no injuries concerns for the match , aside from striker francileudo dos santos who is still seeing a specialist over his shin injury .

" i do n't have any preferences , " said spain 's coach .
" france do n't appear to be in very good physical shape but can cause us problems because they are very experienced and know what the world cup is all about . " " switzerland are a young side like us , they play good football and they are very strong on the break .
korea , well , they run like devils .

the group h clash will decide who joins likely group winners spain in the knockout stage .
tunisia need a win to make virtually certain they claim the second spot while ukraine are likely to require only a draw .
dw-world.de will give you all the action from the game between ukraine , world cup debutants , and tunisia , looking for their first win in a world cup game since 1978 .
we will also give you highlights from the other group h game between saudi-arabia and spain .
the line-ups .
ukraine -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 1-oleksander shovkovsky ; 6-andriy rusol , 22-vyacheslav svidersky , 2-andriy nesmachny ; 9-oleg gusev , 4-anatoly tymoshchyuk , 8-oleg shelayev , 19-maxim kalinichenko , 11-serhiy rebrov ; 7-andriy shevchenko , 10-andriy voronin coach : oleg blokhin tunisia -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : 1-ali boumnijel ; 6-hatem trabelsi , 15-radhi jaidi , 3-karim hagui , 19-anis ayari ; 20-hamed namouchi , 12-joahar mnari , 14-adel chedli , 8-medhi nafti , 13-riadh bouazizi ; 5-ziad jaziri coach : roger lemerre referee : carlos amarilla -lrb- paraguay -rrb- about ten minutes to kick-off .
tunisia again have to start without their injured striker dos santos .
the players are entering the pitch .
the blue and yellow fans of ukraine are dancing and singing .
they are in majority but part of the stadium is red and waving the tunisian flag .
the anthems have been played .
the players shake hands .
1. min .
tunisia kick off .
1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .
jaidi screws up outside the box for voronin to steal the ball .
the ukraine comes two against one but voronin 's pass is sloppy .
4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .
nafti almost finds jaziri running into the box .
7. min .
ukraine have managed to get a small grip on the events but both teams have started rather carefully and mistakes are not few on either side .
8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .
13. min .
trabelsi again .
the tunisian gets the ball down at the right flag and dribbles his way into the box where he loses the ball .
13. min .
jaidi gets a shot but it flies high over shovkovsky 's goal .
15. min .
a wall pass opens up the tunisian defense and creates some confusion that leads to a free-kick for the ukrainians .
shevchenko hits it far though .
17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .
if one of the teams decided to raise the tempo they would probably give the opponents such a shock they would n't understand what happened .
21. min .
at last some action .
the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .
it looks as he is past his two defenders but somehow loses the ball before having a chance to finish .
33. min .
tunisians combine nicely .
no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .
37. min .
the ukrainians are walking the thinner line .
if tunisia were to score it could prove fatal as it might be hard to switch pace later .
38. min .
jaidi seem to have hurt himself suddenly .
the tunisian defender limps to the sideline 39. min .
trabelsi gets a good cross in from the right and it lands in front of goal between two ukrainians and jaziri who ca n't reach it .
trabelsi has been the one tunisian player who stands out a bit .
42. min .
some booing and whistling reach the pitch .
42. min .
bouazizi booked .
44. min .
shevchenko fiddles about with the ball in the box .
has someone put sleeping pills in the water bottles around the pitch ? 45 + 1. min .
jaziri leaves the pitch after an attack on shelayev .
45 + 1. min .
first half ends .
shelayev rockets a shot from twenty five meters just before the sending off of jaziri .
the shot is the last -lrb- and almost only -rrb- real attempt on goal in this boring first half .
the players are back on the pitch .
let 's hope it 's a better second half .
45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .
the teams are still impersonating the living dead .
50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .
52. min .
more unhappy whistling from the stands .
the ukrainian fans are wondering why no one is in the tunisian box when the cross comes flying in .
54. min .
rebrov leaves for vorobey .
56. min .
trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures a nation expects dw-world.de presents germany 's 2006 world cup squad .

tunisia again have to start without their injured striker dos santos .
the players are entering the pitch .
the blue and yellow fans of ukraine are dancing and singing .
they are in majority but part of the stadium is red and waving the tunisian flag .
the anthems have been played .
the players shake hands .
1. min .
tunisia kick off .
1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .
jaidi screws up outside the box for voronin to steal the ball .
the ukraine comes two against one but voronin 's pass is sloppy .
4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .
nafti almost finds jaziri running into the box .
7. min .
ukraine have managed to get a small grip on the events but both teams have started rather carefully and mistakes are not few on either side .
8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .
13. min .
trabelsi again .
the tunisian gets the ball down at the right flag and dribbles his way into the box where he loses the ball .
13. min .
jaidi gets a shot but it flies high over shovkovsky 's goal .
15. min .
a wall pass opens up the tunisian defense and creates some confusion that leads to a free-kick for the ukrainians .
shevchenko hits it far though .
17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .
if one of the teams decided to raise the tempo they would probably give the opponents such a shock they would n't understand what happened .
21. min .
at last some action .
the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .
it looks as he is past his two defenders but somehow loses the ball before having a chance to finish .
33. min .
tunisians combine nicely .
no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .
37. min .
the ukrainians are walking the thinner line .
if tunisia were to score it could prove fatal as it might be hard to switch pace later .
38. min .
jaidi seem to have hurt himself suddenly .
the tunisian defender limps to the sideline 39. min .
trabelsi gets a good cross in from the right and it lands in front of goal between two ukrainians and jaziri who ca n't reach it .
trabelsi has been the one tunisian player who stands out a bit .
42. min .
some booing and whistling reach the pitch .
42. min .
bouazizi booked .
44. min .
shevchenko fiddles about with the ball in the box .
has someone put sleeping pills in the water bottles around the pitch ? 45 + 1. min .
jaziri leaves the pitch after an attack on shelayev .
45 + 1. min .
first half ends .
shelayev rockets a shot from twenty five meters just before the sending off of jaziri .
the shot is the last -lrb- and almost only -rrb- real attempt on goal in this boring first half .
the players are back on the pitch .
let 's hope it 's a better second half .
45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .
the teams are still impersonating the living dead .
50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .
52. min .
more unhappy whistling from the stands .
the ukrainian fans are wondering why no one is in the tunisian box when the cross comes flying in .
54. min .
rebrov leaves for vorobey .
56. min .
trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .

it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy .

nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services .

the french must win to go through while switzerland and south-korea could reach the last sixteen with a draw , although it 's unlikely any of the teams will want to risk playing for such a result .
the line-ups .
togo -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 16-kossi agassa ; 2-dare nibombe , 3-jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , 5-massamesso tchangai ; 13-richmond forson , 7-moustapha salifou , 18-yao junior senaya , 10-cherif toure mamam , 6-yao aziawanou ; 4-emmanuel adebayor , 17-mohamed kader coubadja .

there is no genuine playmaker to replace zidane in a four-man midfield on the right side of which exciting newcomer franck ribery will start a match for france for the second time .
mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .
the players are in the tunnel .
the teams take the pitch .

1. min .
the french will certainly try to get an early goal .
they start off in a good tempo and sagnol gets the first cross .
3. min .
the french are high up .
first chance is trzeguet 's .
the striker gets the ball just inside the box and turns to shoot .
his ball goes a meter wide .
5. min .
the french will have to watch out though .
it is never easy to play a team who has nothing to lose .
6. min .
trzeguet again .
ribery hits in the cross from the left and trezeguet heads it hard .
agassa gets a hand on it and tips it over the bar .
8. min .
a fast counter attack by togo gives barthez in the french goal a first opportunity to show himself .
10. min .
the game is leveling out .
the first minutes of french dominance have given way to a more even game .

trezeguet 's goal is offside .
the french striker gets the ball from ribery inside the box and scores before realizing he 's offside .
17. min .

the togolese are dangerous though when they get a chance to counter , something they do at high speed .
19. min .
the togolese have had it fairly easy to break the french attack , which gives the africans possibilities to counter over and over again .
21. min .
trezeguet again .
ribery has started the match well and hits another opener for trezeguet who should have finished better .
the ball is no problem for agassa .
22. min .
silvestre tries agassa with a half volley .
the pressure is there , the chances too but no goal .
25. min .
mamam tries a cross towards the middle but there are no togolese there .
27. min .
salifou comes in from the left and fires a shot that barthez ca n't hold at first .
the french goalie jumps forward to pull the ball back in .
27. min .

29. min .
mamam 's free-kick outside the french box is too high .
31. min .
a ball from ribery sails in to the box and is headed over the end line by nibombe just before trezeguet gets a chance to put his head on the ball .
35. min .
trezeguet gets a ball to run for but again the french striker is caught offside .
this time it 's very close .
37. min .
aziawonou sees yellow .
38. min .

39. min .

45. min .
the togolese must be happy going into the break with a 0-0 .

a lovely cross from malouda is headed out by nibombe who 's perfectly placed in front of trezeguet and henry both waiting to score .
45 + 1. min .
first half is over .
the french have piled up chances but no goal .
the togolese will have a tough second half but are also pretty cool in defense and make use of their counters , which have given the africans a handful of decent chances .
as it stands , a 0-1 for the french will be enough to see them trough thanks to the swiss leading korea 1-0 .
question is if france will have the mental strength to deliver .

mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .
not even the entrance of brazilian born star striker dos santos with 11 minutes left could ratchet up the pace . spain beat saudi-arabia to win group h in the other group h game , a spanish team with much of their first string resting on the bench beat saudi-arabia in kaiserslautern to defend their top slot in the group . spain and ukraine 's next opponents will be decided in friday 's final set of group round matches .

with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .

tunisia again have to start without their injured striker dos santos .
the players are entering the pitch .
the blue and yellow fans of ukraine are dancing and singing .
they are in majority but part of the stadium is red and waving the tunisian flag .
the anthems have been played .
the players shake hands .
1. min .
tunisia kick off .
1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .
jaidi screws up outside the box for voronin to steal the ball .
the ukraine comes two against one but voronin 's pass is sloppy .
4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .
nafti almost finds jaziri running into the box .
7. min .
ukraine have managed to get a small grip on the events but both teams have started rather carefully and mistakes are not few on either side .
8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .
13. min .
trabelsi again .
the tunisian gets the ball down at the right flag and dribbles his way into the box where he loses the ball .
13. min .

17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .
if one of the teams decided to raise the tempo they would probably give the opponents such a shock they would n't understand what happened .
21. min .
at last some action .
the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .
it looks as he is past his two defenders but somehow loses the ball before having a chance to finish .
33. min .
tunisians combine nicely .
no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .
37. min .
the ukrainians are walking the thinner line .
if tunisia were to score it could prove fatal as it might be hard to switch pace later .
38. min .
jaidi seem to have hurt himself suddenly .
the tunisian defender limps to the sideline 39. min .
trabelsi gets a good cross in from the right and it lands in front of goal between two ukrainians and jaziri who ca n't reach it .
trabelsi has been the one tunisian player who stands out a bit .
42. min .
some booing and whistling reach the pitch .
42. min .
bouazizi booked .
44. min .
shevchenko fiddles about with the ball in the box .
has someone put sleeping pills in the water bottles around the pitch ? 45 + 1. min .
jaziri leaves the pitch after an attack on shelayev .
45 + 1. min .
first half ends .
shelayev rockets a shot from twenty five meters just before the sending off of jaziri .
the shot is the last -lrb- and almost only -rrb- real attempt on goal in this boring first half .
the players are back on the pitch .
let 's hope it 's a better second half .
45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .
the teams are still impersonating the living dead .
50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .

you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" i do n't have any preferences , " said spain 's coach .
" france do n't appear to be in very good physical shape but can cause us problems because they are very experienced and know what the world cup is all about . " " switzerland are a young side like us , they play good football and they are very strong on the break .
korea , well , they run like devils .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2006 opinion : bush 's freedom speech fell flat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush delivered his speech on budapest 's gellert hill with his speech in budapest on thursday , us president george w. bush attempted to latch onto an american tradition of great orations on freedom , but it did n't quite work out that way , says dw 's miodrag soric . john f. kennedy , jimmy carter , ronald reagan : all of these american presidents delivered speeches in europe on the topic of freedom .
above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- germany borrows heavily to balance 2006 budget germany 's grand coalition government has presented its 2006 budget plan to parliament to seek approval for a rise in spending and the creation of new debt in its efforts to boost the economy .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades .

it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades .

" most of the districts in bangladesh do not have satellite cable connection .
they can not see all the matches of the world cup , so we want all the matches shown on the national terrestrial television , " said former national goalkeeper and protest organizer kaiser hamid . the protest was staged by the combined sports family , an association whose members include former professional athletes and officials such as referees and coaches .
about 100 members formed the human chain outside the government secretariat in the capital to urge the government to boost the number of matches being shown on the state-owned btv .
" we also demand that the power officials do not cut the power during the matches so that everyone in the villages can live and breathe football , " hamid said . the world cup is attracting massive interest in sports-obsessed bangladesh . flags of the two most popular teams - brazil and argentina - can be seen flying everywhere from rickshaws to office buildings . in the southeastern city of chittagong , big screens put up to show matches have been attracting so many people from outlying villages that the city is regularly brought to a standstill . more briefs 23.06.2006 -pipe- american captain reyna set to retire 22.06.2006 -pipe- losing to sweden not an option for klinsmann 22.06.2006 -pipe- organizers disappointed by world cup pitches 22.06.2006 -pipe- mind goes over matter at the world cup 22.06.2006 -pipe- chef keeps team korea stomachs happy 21.06.2006 -pipe- players should drink more cherry juice 21.06.2006 -pipe- nostrodamus backs spain to win the world cup 20.06.2006 -pipe- world cup losses undermine stock markets dw-tv europe live europa aktuell we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate . " but both german intelligence and the bka have denied that " sam " works for either body and said they could prove that the man identified by el-masri was in germany at the time of his abduction . does germany sanction torture ? while one burning question at thursday 's hearing was the identity of " sam , " another was the extent of german authorities ' involvement in the case . wolfgang neskovic , the left party 's member of the oversight committee , said that the basic principle at stake was whether germany was willing to sanction torture as a tool in the war on terror . so far , the committee 's findings have been neutral . " there 's still no proof that german authorities were involved in the incident , " said thomas opermann from the investigation committee . injustice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri broke down during the hearing but el-masri 's attorney has argued otherwise . " if it turns out that german authorities were involved , then it would n't be up to us to demand action .

tunisia again have to start without their injured striker dos santos .
the players are entering the pitch .
the blue and yellow fans of ukraine are dancing and singing .
they are in majority but part of the stadium is red and waving the tunisian flag .
the anthems have been played .
the players shake hands .
1. min .
tunisia kick off .
1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .
jaidi screws up outside the box for voronin to steal the ball .
the ukraine comes two against one but voronin 's pass is sloppy .
4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .
nafti almost finds jaziri running into the box .
7. min .
ukraine have managed to get a small grip on the events but both teams have started rather carefully and mistakes are not few on either side .
8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .
13. min .
trabelsi again .
the tunisian gets the ball down at the right flag and dribbles his way into the box where he loses the ball .
13. min .
jaidi gets a shot but it flies high over shovkovsky 's goal .
15. min .
a wall pass opens up the tunisian defense and creates some confusion that leads to a free-kick for the ukrainians .
shevchenko hits it far though .
17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .
if one of the teams decided to raise the tempo they would probably give the opponents such a shock they would n't understand what happened .
21. min .
at last some action .
the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .
it looks as he is past his two defenders but somehow loses the ball before having a chance to finish .
33. min .
tunisians combine nicely .
no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .
37. min .
the ukrainians are walking the thinner line .
if tunisia were to score it could prove fatal as it might be hard to switch pace later .
38. min .
jaidi seem to have hurt himself suddenly .
the tunisian defender limps to the sideline 39. min .
trabelsi gets a good cross in from the right and it lands in front of goal between two ukrainians and jaziri who ca n't reach it .

42. min .
some booing and whistling reach the pitch .
42. min .
bouazizi booked .
44. min .
shevchenko fiddles about with the ball in the box .
has someone put sleeping pills in the water bottles around the pitch ? 45 + 1. min .
jaziri leaves the pitch after an attack on shelayev .
45 + 1. min .
first half ends .
shelayev rockets a shot from twenty five meters just before the sending off of jaziri .
the shot is the last -lrb- and almost only -rrb- real attempt on goal in this boring first half .
the players are back on the pitch .
let 's hope it 's a better second half .
45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .
the teams are still impersonating the living dead .
50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .
52. min .
more unhappy whistling from the stands .
the ukrainian fans are wondering why no one is in the tunisian box when the cross comes flying in .
54. min .
rebrov leaves for vorobey .
56. min .
trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .

their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .

few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .

their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2006 opinion : bush 's freedom speech fell flat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush delivered his speech on budapest 's gellert hill with his speech in budapest on thursday , us president george w. bush attempted to latch onto an american tradition of great orations on freedom , but it did n't quite work out that way , says dw 's miodrag soric . john f. kennedy , jimmy carter , ronald reagan : all of these american presidents delivered speeches in europe on the topic of freedom .
above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .

the french must win to go through while switzerland and south-korea could reach the last sixteen with a draw , although it 's unlikely any of the teams will want to risk playing for such a result .
the line-ups .
togo -lrb- 3-5-2 -rrb- : 16-kossi agassa ; 2-dare nibombe , 3-jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , 5-massamesso tchangai ; 13-richmond forson , 7-moustapha salifou , 18-yao junior senaya , 10-cherif toure mamam , 6-yao aziawanou ; 4-emmanuel adebayor , 17-mohamed kader coubadja .
coach : otto pfister france -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : 16-fabien barthez ; 19-willy sagnol , 15-lilian thuram , 5-william gallas , 13-mikael silvestre ; 22-franck ribery , 4-patrick vieira , 6-claude makelele , 7-florent malouda ; 20-david trezeguet , 12-thierry henry coach : raymond domenech referee : jorge larrionda -lrb- uruguay -rrb- france coach raymond domenech , missing playmaker zinedine zidane and defender eric abidal through suspension , paired david trezeguet with thierry henry in attack for a game the french must win by two clear goals to make sure of reaching the last 16 of the world cup .
there is no genuine playmaker to replace zidane in a four-man midfield on the right side of which exciting newcomer franck ribery will start a match for france for the second time .
mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .
the players are in the tunnel .
the teams take the pitch .
the crowd roars a welcome that quickly changes into peace as the anthems begin .
a long strip of yellow togo fans run along the side of the field but the blue fans of france are in majority under the roof in cologne .
1. min .
the french kick-off .
1. min .
the french will certainly try to get an early goal .
they start off in a good tempo and sagnol gets the first cross .
3. min .
the french are high up .
first chance is trzeguet 's .
the striker gets the ball just inside the box and turns to shoot .
his ball goes a meter wide .
5. min .
the french will have to watch out though .
it is never easy to play a team who has nothing to lose .
6. min .
trzeguet again .
ribery hits in the cross from the left and trezeguet heads it hard .
agassa gets a hand on it and tips it over the bar .
8. min .
a fast counter attack by togo gives barthez in the french goal a first opportunity to show himself .
10. min .
the game is leveling out .
the first minutes of french dominance have given way to a more even game .
11. min .
a long cross from the right ends up only a meter away from barthez who saves the following shot standing on his knees .
13. min .
trezeguet 's goal is offside .
the french striker gets the ball from ribery inside the box and scores before realizing he 's offside .
17. min .
the french have had a couple of good chances to score but so far it 's goalless .
the togolese are dangerous though when they get a chance to counter , something they do at high speed .
19. min .
the togolese have had it fairly easy to break the french attack , which gives the africans possibilities to counter over and over again .
21. min .
trezeguet again .
ribery has started the match well and hits another opener for trezeguet who should have finished better .
the ball is no problem for agassa .
22. min .
silvestre tries agassa with a half volley .
the pressure is there , the chances too but no goal .
25. min .
mamam tries a cross towards the middle but there are no togolese there .
27. min .
salifou comes in from the left and fires a shot that barthez ca n't hold at first .
the french goalie jumps forward to pull the ball back in .
27. min .
ribery brings the ball down the togolese field and gets a great chance to score .
his shot flies high over the goal though .
28. min .
makelele gets booked .
29. min .
mamam 's free-kick outside the french box is too high .
31. min .
a ball from ribery sails in to the box and is headed over the end line by nibombe just before trezeguet gets a chance to put his head on the ball .
35. min .
trezeguet gets a ball to run for but again the french striker is caught offside .
this time it 's very close .
37. min .
aziawonou sees yellow .
38. min .
the french keep coming in strong attacking waves but the togolese have so far always found a way to surf their way out of trouble .
39. min .
henry fires a rocket from thirty meters .
agassa can not hold it .
trezeguet takes the rebound from five meters but the togolese keeper is there again .
40. min .
will the french go into a panic ?
a first false pass by the french is met with whistles .
the french crowd is merciless .
43. min .
mamam gets booked .
the togolese holds on to vieira in the mid circle .
45. min .
the togolese must be happy going into the break with a 0-0 .
45 + 1. min .
a lovely cross from malouda is headed out by nibombe who 's perfectly placed in front of trezeguet and henry both waiting to score .
45 + 1. min .
first half is over .
the french have piled up chances but no goal .
the togolese will have a tough second half but are also pretty cool in defense and make use of their counters , which have given the africans a handful of decent chances .
as it stands , a 0-1 for the french will be enough to see them trough thanks to the swiss leading korea 1-0 .
question is if france will have the mental strength to deliver .
45. min .
second half is on .
45. min .

54. min .
goal france ! ! !
vieria .
54. min .

" most of the districts in bangladesh do not have satellite cable connection .
they can not see all the matches of the world cup , so we want all the matches shown on the national terrestrial television , " said former national goalkeeper and protest organizer kaiser hamid . the protest was staged by the combined sports family , an association whose members include former professional athletes and officials such as referees and coaches .
about 100 members formed the human chain outside the government secretariat in the capital to urge the government to boost the number of matches being shown on the state-owned btv .
" we also demand that the power officials do not cut the power during the matches so that everyone in the villages can live and breathe football , " hamid said . the world cup is attracting massive interest in sports-obsessed bangladesh . flags of the two most popular teams - brazil and argentina - can be seen flying everywhere from rickshaws to office buildings . in the southeastern city of chittagong , big screens put up to show matches have been attracting so many people from outlying villages that the city is regularly brought to a standstill . more briefs 23.06.2006 -pipe- american captain reyna set to retire 22.06.2006 -pipe- losing to sweden not an option for klinsmann 22.06.2006 -pipe- organizers disappointed by world cup pitches 22.06.2006 -pipe- mind goes over matter at the world cup 22.06.2006 -pipe- chef keeps team korea stomachs happy 21.06.2006 -pipe- players should drink more cherry juice 21.06.2006 -pipe- nostrodamus backs spain to win the world cup 20.06.2006 -pipe- world cup losses undermine stock markets dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .
" the swiss might relax , thinking they just need a draw .
it could give us a chance to put them under pressure .
we will not need to look at the result of the france-togo game . " hakan yakin made a big impact when he came on as a replacement in the 2-0 triumph over togo and the attacking midfielder is confident that switzerland will not underestimate south korea or play for the draw .
" it 's definitely an advantage for us now that we do n't have to beat south korea , " said yakin , who is now injury-free after a long spell on the sidelines . " it could also be dangerous though because the koreans need to win .
it 's no good us playing for a draw because we saw during their draw with france how dangerous they can be in the last 10 minutes . " the first ever match between the two countries could develop into a battle of wits between south korea 's coach dick advocaat and his opposite number kobi kuhn , who have been hailed as tactical geniuses for their match-altering substitutions . former champions having to dig deep to progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of zidane 's international career ?
meanwhile france will meet togo in cologne without suspended skipper zinedine zidane .
but keeper fabien barthez has urged his teammates to forget about the suspended zizou and get on with the job " we ca n't let his absence get us down , we 've got to think about getting a result , think about our game with or without him , " said barthez .
" there 's no room for feelings like that - it 's up to us to adapt . " despite two lethargic performances to date , the goalkeeper insists france are still on track .
" we 're still on target to win the world cup , " a bullish barthez insisted . france are out to erase the memory of their humiliating title defense when they crashed out in the first round four years ago without scoring a goal , but barthez said fear of a repeat debacle four years on was not on their minds . " you should never have fear , you should never have regrets .
you do n't get small teams in the world cup anymore , like you had 10 or 20 years ago , " said barthez , " you ca n't be concerned , you 've got to remain confident and think about winning .
that 's all !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 23.06.2006 a sleeping pill of a game sees ukraine stumble forward großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine celebrate their trip to world cup 's the round of 16 the ukrainian and tunisian fans who came to berlin hoping to see their team advance were given a poor show as ukraine , with the help of a penalty , managed an uneventful 1-0 victory to see them through to the last 16 . the ukraine were seen as favorites to win this game , and so they did , but not without some luck . anis ayari hit a free-kick in the 64th minute for tunisia that was deflected just over the crossbar by a ukrainian hand in the wall .
that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .
not even the entrance of brazilian born star striker dos santos with 11 minutes left could ratchet up the pace . spain beat saudi-arabia to win group h in the other group h game , a spanish team with much of their first string resting on the bench beat saudi-arabia in kaiserslautern to defend their top slot in the group . spain and ukraine 's next opponents will be decided in friday 's final set of group round matches .

that could have been a penalty for the tunisians at a crucial moment in a still goalless match . total lack of creativity the game played in front of a predominantly neutral crowd but with sections of ukrainian blue and yellow joined by flecks of tunisian red , never took off .
in the second minute andriy voronin stole the ball to build up a two-against-one but as he passed the ball sloppily , and it never reached its address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukranian fans did n't have much to watch in the thrid group match the rest of the game continued in similar fashion .
few chances were created .
in fact the word " create " can not really be used to describe the match that was mainly a display of long balls , mistakes and a lot of ping pong at midfield . hatem trabelsi , the tunisian skipper , tried in the first twenty minutes to make a difference .
with good pace , a rarity in this game , he went through a couple of times on the right wing to deliver his crosses , but they never posed any serious threat to shovkovsky in the ukraine goal . between the 21st and the 27th minute the ukrainians raised the tempo in a six-minute stint that featured actual combinations that put pressure on the tunisian defense .
what ended this offensive push so quickly remains a mystery . why they did n't come back after the break with the urge to win is an even bigger one , as they were a man up after tunisia 's only striker , ziad jaziri , was given the red card on stoppage time in first half . penalty and no penalty needed to decide the match bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a penalty kick was the only goal of a game both teams needed to win the second half provided more of the same , although it 's likely the ukrainians were told to stand higher up in the field , something that swung the game slightly in favor of the world cup newcomers .
their side had more possession but did little to open up the scoring . instead it was tunisia who got a good chance in the 64th minute with a free-kick only a couple of meters outside the ukrainian penalty box .
ayari struck it well , but the replay showed it was deflected by voronin 's hand , and the ukrainians must be relieved it did n't result in a penalty kick for tunisia . five minutes later shevchenko trickled passed his defenders to come clean with boumnijel in the tunisian goal .
the keeper made himself big and followed shevchenko 's move well , something that karim hagui should have considered before bringing down the ukrainian striker who rather easily got his penalty .
the ac milan star went up to the spot and placed the ball behind boumnijel without much effort . even down a goal , the expected tunisian onslaught for an equalizer never materialized .
not even the entrance of brazilian born star striker dos santos with 11 minutes left could ratchet up the pace . spain beat saudi-arabia to win group h in the other group h game , a spanish team with much of their first string resting on the bench beat saudi-arabia in kaiserslautern to defend their top slot in the group . spain and ukraine 's next opponents will be decided in friday 's final set of group round matches .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

1. min .
a long ball down to shevchenko on the right is the first attempt in the game .
2. min .
what a chance for ukraine .

4. min .
a free-kick from kalininchenko from the left goes well over goal .
5. min .

8. min .
jaziri gets booked for falling lightly in the box .
9. min .
the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .

24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .

no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .

45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .

50. min .
more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .
52. min .
more unhappy whistling from the stands .
the ukrainian fans are wondering why no one is in the tunisian box when the cross comes flying in .
54. min .

56. min .
trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .
-lrb- may 20 , 2006 -rrb- german coalition agrees on tax for wealthy , other reforms germany 's grand coalition government spent a long night in negotiations over key reforms .
after five hours of discussions , leaders have reached compromises over a wealth tax and parental subsidies , but not health care .

a naturalized german citizen , he insisted he was interrogated by a german agent . " based on the way he looked and his accent , he was definitely german , " he said .
he explained that the man he knew as " sam " made his first appearance in the kabul prison where el-masri was being held in may 2004 , and that his treatment improved immediately . el-masri said he had recognized " sam " in photographs of an official with the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- . nonetheless , according to martin hofmann , one of the state prosecutors investigating the case , " there is no evidence to suggest that el-masri 's account of his abduction is not accurate .

" there 's still no proof that german authorities were involved in the incident , " said thomas opermann from the investigation committee . injustice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri broke down during the hearing but el-masri 's attorney has argued otherwise . " if it turns out that german authorities were involved , then it would n't be up to us to demand action .
what happened was a huge injustice , " said his lawyer , manfred gnjidic . el-masri says he was kidnapped while in macedonia in late 2003 and then transferred to a cia-run prison in afghanistan where he was held for four months .
after his release he says he was dumped in albania . recalling his ordeal , el-masri struggled to contain himself and asked for a break in questioning . opposition mps are outraged by his account .

switzerland beat south korea to win the group . les bleus finished behind switzerland to earn the second group g spot among the last 16 teams in cologne on friday , winning by the two-goal margin they needed to guarantee a match against spain in the cup 's next round . togo , at their first ever finals , did n't make it easy for the french .
the favored european side failed to convert a hatful of chances in the first 45 minutes , largely thanks to the heroics of kossi agassa in the togo goal . close to the break agassa performed a near miracle to first block florent malouda 's shot then scrambled around to keep out trezeguet 's attempt to knock in the rebound inches from his line . fighting for their world cup lives , raymond domenech 's french side was missing suspended playmaker zinedine zidane and desperately in search of their first world cup win since a 3-0 triumph over brazil eight years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were n't always so peaceful on the french team before the game france dig deep for chance to play spain domenech admitted that friday 's game " was difficult and i 'll not deny that .
but this team can dig deep .
i am happy for the team .
the next match against spain will be super . " while france will have felt aggrieved not to be ahead at the break , already knocked out togo fulfilled their promise not to make up the numbers , looking dangerous on the counter attack with french keeper fabian barthez having to move smartly to punch clear a shot from mohamed kader . patrick vieira earned man of the match honors on his 30th birthday , taking a pass from frank ribery 10 minutes into the second half and bending it off his right foot into the corner of the net . six minutes later vieira , who has faced criticism for a disappointing start in germany , headed down the ball thierry henry fired into the goal from the middle of the penalty box . swiss send south korea crashing out of cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss defense proved up to what south korea threw at it a controversial 2-0 victory swept switzerland past south korea and into the round of 16 in hanover at a game that ran simultaneously with the togo-france match-up . arsenal defender philippe senderos put switzerland ahead in the first half before striker alexander frei killed the koreans ' hopes of equalizing with a hotly disputed goal in the 77th minute . the korean defense stopped after the assistant referee flagged frei offside but the striker slid the ball home and was delighted when argentine referee horacio elizondo allowed the goal to stand despite furious protests from the whole south korean team . " we played well over the three games , we did n't concede any goals and we scored four , " an optimistic frei said after the game .
" now we 'll try to conquer the world ! " switzerland , who reached the second round in their last appearance in the world cup finals 12 years ago , play their next match against ukraine . korea nearly caught switzerland cold in the third minute with a sweeping move down the left .
lee chun-soo darted into the box but his low cross was just too strong for the onrushing lee ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senderos , right , will remember the goal - and the elbow to the head elbow to the head ca n't sink swiss the swiss side surged forward looking for an early goal and tranquillo barnetta had a goal-bound shot blocked by a desperate lunge from veteran defender choi jin-cheul in the ninth minute . the pressure paid off for switzerland in the 23rd minute when they went ahead from a set piece .
hakan yakin fired in a left-footed free kick to the back post and arsenal defender senderos rose high to power a header past lee . senderos clashed heads with choi and blood started to stream down his face but the battling 21-year-old was too overjoyed at scoring his third international goal to feel any pain . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de three playing for group g progress while togo play for pride two teams from south korea , switzerland and france have the chance to make the last 16 of the world cup as group g reaches its conclusion friday .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

togo , however , know that the flight home is already booked . south korea will have to conjure up more of their 2002 magic to pull a last 16 place out of the hat with victory over switzerland in their group g crunch match hanover on friday . a comeback win over togo and a much-acclaimed 1-1 draw with 1998 world champions france could be to no avail because of switzerland 's marginally better goal difference which gives them the luxury of just needing a point from the final group fixture . if the koreans lose to the powerful swiss and france beat trouble-plagued togo by two clear goals , the surprise 2002 semi-finalists will go out .
but a win will see them top the group such are the muddling permutations . south korea , who humbled european powerhouses portugal , italy and spain during their glory run four years ago , could still qualify in second place if they draw with switzerland but the players are refusing to dream that togo can achieve a result against the fading but still flair-filled french . other final-day scenarios could result in the drawing of lots to determine whether france or south korea progress to the second round but neither side want to rely on lady luck for their world cup survival . the asian flag bearers are hoping that switzerland might adopt a defensive approach which would play into their hands but their opponents insist they are not crazy enough to set out their stall for a draw . south korea determined to go through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the equalizer against france raised south korean hopes " we are determined to defeat switzerland and go through -lrb- to the last 16 -rrb- , " said striker cho jae-jin , whose header across goal set up park ji-sung 's dramatic 81st minute equalizer against france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2006 opinion : bush 's freedom speech fell flat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush delivered his speech on budapest 's gellert hill with his speech in budapest on thursday , us president george w. bush attempted to latch onto an american tradition of great orations on freedom , but it did n't quite work out that way , says dw 's miodrag soric . john f. kennedy , jimmy carter , ronald reagan : all of these american presidents delivered speeches in europe on the topic of freedom .
above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .

above all , they called on the soviet dictators to give freedom back to the nations of eastern europe .
the support of the free world was guaranteed , as was resounding applause back home .
on thursday , president bush attempted to follow this tradition with a speech in budapest , but he did n't quite succeed .
the most important difference since the era of reagan and his predecessors : the soviet union .
the country once dubbed the " evil empire " no longer exists .
even if critics still rightly point to the kremlin 's human rights violations , the fact is that even russia is on the path towards becoming a democracy . shaky comparison the other point is that calls for freedom are much more effective when the speaker draws on the present-day situation .
president bush , however , drew on hungary 's unsuccessful 1956 revolt against communism .
he tried to segue to the here and now with a comment on iraq , the message being : just as hungarians fought for freedom in 1956 , so iraqis do today . but this comparison , as with so many historical comparisons , flopped .
it does n't even bear thinking about what would happen if the iraqis really were in a position to decide whether american troops were welcome in their country or not . in the arab world , many compare the soviet occupation of afghanistan in 1979 with the deployment of american troops in iraq today .
bush would , rightly so , reject such parallels .
without the presence of us troops , iraq would likely slide into a state of civil war .
and even though this is the case , bush was still unable to portray us troops as liberators in his speech . lacking credibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty international activists dressed as guantanamo detainees for their protest in budapest this is mainly due to the policies of the united states and its highest officials .
those who - like bush - lay claim to a leading role in the fight for freedom and respect for human rights should at least be credible .
the americans simply do n't have the kind of credibility they did back in 1956 . in recent times , american soldiers have too often been guilty of human rights violations , killing and torturing civilians .
you ca n't claim to respect human rights and defend a camp like guantanamo in the same breath .
september 11 , 2001 can not eternally be used as an excuse as to why international laws should apply to all nations except the usa . if anyone in budapest deserves to be praised , then it 's hungarian president laszlo solyom , whose message to bush was that the fight against international terrorism can only succeed if , at every step , the rules of international justice are obeyed and human rights are respected . miodrag soric -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush to eu : we 're working on closing guantanamo us president george w. bush and eu leaders wednesday sent a warning to iran and north korea on their nuclear plans but avoided a public squabble over eu concerns at human rights abuses in guantanamo bay prison camp .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- us expected to pledge to respect human rights at summit us president george w. bush meets with the 25-nation european union wednesday in a summit expected to show that the two sides closing ranks over respecting human rights while fighting terrorism .
-lrb- june 21 , 2006 -rrb- eu , us present united front ahead of vienna summit vienna is gearing up to host the next eu-us summit on wednesday .
while the relationship between the two powers is often described as " complex , " this time , it seems there is consensus on the main issues up for discussion .

mikael silvestre comes in for abidal at left back while central defender lilian thuram wins his 117th cap , breaking the national record he shared with marcel desailly .
togo coach otto pfister , who had promised to gave all of his players a chance to take the field , made four changes to his starting line-up bringing in jean paul yaovi abalo dosseh , yao aziawanou , moustapha salifou and yao junior senaya , in place of thomas dossevi , kuami agboh , alaixys romao and toure assimiou .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .
they 've been eyeing up chancellor merkel 's progress on economic reforms and wonder what she 's waiting for .
-lrb- june 20 , 2006 -rrb- vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

the tunisians are trying to go through on the right with trabelsi , who has managed to go around the ukraine defense a couple of times to deliver the cross .
11. min .
the teams are in no hurry .
ukraine are playing a lot of long balls from the defense but they have n't caused the tunisians any real problems yet .

17. min .
svidersky sees yellow .
18. min .
the tunisian free-kick is hit on goal but the ukrainian keeper is well positioned and has no problems .
20. min .

the ukrainians suddenly do push the tempo and the result is the best chance so far .
tymoshchyuk gets a good shot on goal from within the box .
boumnijel in the tunisian goal has to prove himself .
24. min .
in the last three minutes the ukrainians have started combinig and have found their way into the box on several occasions .
nothing really dangerous so far though .
27. min .
we 're still not at light speed but the game is slightly more thrilling at the moment .
28. min .
the crowd finding ways of entertainment .
the wave performed in the stands is louder and more exciting than the game obviously .
30. min .
a corner for the tunisians .
nothing else to report .
come on now teams ! 31. min .
shevchenko through .
a well balanced chip finds the ukrainian striker 's foot on the box line .

no result though .
not even a shot .
35. min .
an ukrainian free-kick lands on the goal roof .

45. min .
second half gets underway with ukraine kicking off .
46. min .
shelayev booked for bringing down trabelsi .
48. min .
no signs of a speedier more exhilarating game in the first few minutes .

more long balls from the ukrainians .
this one reaches voronin on the right but he has no time before the tunisian defense is all around him .

trying to be optimistic , you could say that both defenses are tight , but in all honesty they have not had much serious threat to fight off .
58. min .
the ukrainians have positioned themselves higher up the field to try to gain early control and it seems to be working .
ukraine have more possession but are still extremely sloppy .
60. min .
tymoshchyuk booked .
62. min .
you might want to ask the ukrainians why , with one man more on the pitch , they do n't try to secure their place in the last sixteen .
63. min .
an ukrainian cross from the right almost reaches the two strikers in the box .
63. min .
rusol sees yellow .
free-kick for tunisia just outside the box .
64. min .
ayari hits a nice free-kick .
the tunisian gets the ball over the wall and it dives down nicely but lands in the net just over the crossbar .
66. min .
in fact ayari 's free-kick deflects off an ukrainian arm .
that could have ended with a penalty .
69. min .
penalty for ukraine ! ! 69. min .
shevchenko hits the penalty home .
the striker was the one who passed the tunisian goalie in the box and who was brought down by hagui .
now his kick could take ukraine to the last sixteen .
72. min .
could this be a wake-up call for the tunisian team who had just started to build up some pace after ayari 's free-kick earlier ? 74. min .
kalinichenko goes out for gusin .
76. min .
the game keeps rolling like it has most of the time .
much like a steam train .
79. min .
dos santos goes on for chedli and ben saada for bouazizi in a double bill .
81. min .
can the tunisian star striker , who so unfortunately have n't been able to play so far in the world cup , change things ? 83. min .
it does n't look like tunisia have anything up the sleeve .
and as the cameras focus on a nearly sleeping fifa boss , it is clear that even the extremist soccer fans have trouble getting enthusiastic about this game .
85. min .
trabelsi gets a chance .
the tunisian captain , the only player in his team to show some talent today , fires off a shot from the right side of the box .
it goes wide .
86. min .
shevchenko leaves for milevsky .
88. min .
voronin gets a chance to score .
the ukrainian striker wall passes his way in and gets a decent shot on the way but boumnijel saves .
89. min .
jaidi sees yellow .
90. min .
nafti goes for ghodbane .
90 + 1. min .
dos santos .
that 's close .
a free-kick lands in the box where players have fallen on the pitch .
the ball then reaches dos santos who heads it just to the left .
90 + 3. min .
game over .
voronin gets a last chance from within the box as he receives a cross , turns and shoots about a meter wide .
that was the end of the perhaps least interesting game of the world cup so far .
it means the ukraine are through together with spain who beat saudi arabia to finalize group h. dw staff -lrb- per -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .

qualified spain are so relaxed that fernando torres and others will sit out the saudi arabia game . andriy shevchenko 's timely return to form in ukraine 's 4-0 thrashing of saudi arabia was one of many plus points from a game that has revived the world cup debutants ' campaign to qualify for the last 16 . ukraine , who lost 4-0 to spain in their opener , showed their attacking intent against a toothless saudi team from the start . the match represented a personal triumph for shevchenko , the striker leading the way with a fine individual performance and combining fantastically with attacking team-mates maksym kalinichenko , serhiy rebrov and oleg rusov . it was pressure from shevchenko that forced saudi arabia into conceding the corner from which andriy rusol scored the opening the goal in the fourth minute . shevchenko then opened his own account one minute into the second-half , rising above defender hamad al-montashari to head a home a kalinichenko free-kick and turned provider for the fourth goal , setting up kalinichenko with a beautifully-weighted cross past a despairing mabrouk zaid in goal and three defenders . big win over saudis boosts ukraine 's chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's andriy rusol got the ball and the goals rolling so emphatic was the score line , in fact , that it immediately revived ukraine 's chances of reaching the last 16 , leaving them two points clear of both tunisia and the saudis with a superior goal difference , and within another win of achieving their objective . shevchenko said there was a huge psychological difference between the spain game and that against saudi arabia .
" during the first game we were overawed by the occasion , " he said .
" we let in two goals from free-kicks , then came the sending off , but monday was a completely different story .
we went ahead almost immediately and played aggressive , flowing football . " confidence restored , ukraine now know that the incentive could not be any greater when they face tunisia in berlin , and shevchenko made no attempt to downplay the game 's significance . " the match against tunisia will be decisive , " he admitted .
" everything now hinges on friday 's result . " now at their fourth world cup finals , tunisia are still seeking a first win since a 3-1 victory over mexico in their 1978 debut in argentina .
they have played 10 matches since then . the tunisians have no injuries concerns for the match , aside from striker francileudo dos santos who is still seeing a specialist over his shin injury .

" torres has come to the tournament in great form , i hope he continues like this and that is why he is going to be rested for the next game , " the coach told reporters . spain lead the group with six points and a goal difference of plus six , ukraine are second on three points while tunisia and saudi arabia have one each . aragones 's men will meet switzerland , south korea or france in the last 16 . " i do n't have any preferences , " said spain 's coach .
" france do n't appear to be in very good physical shape but can cause us problems because they are very experienced and know what the world cup is all about . " " switzerland are a young side like us , they play good football and they are very strong on the break .
korea , well , they run like devils .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2006 german corporate tax reform plan attacked from all sides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say small and medium-sized companies wo n't benefit from the reform german finance minister peer steinbrück has unveiled a tax reform plan that would sink the rate for corporations to under 30 percent .
but the plan has been criticized by both business interests and the left . the plan , which is scheduled to take effect in 2008 , would cut germany 's corporate tax from 25 percent to 12.5 percent , which would result in the total effective tax burden on corporations falling from 38.5 percent to just below the 30 percent mark . the reform is aimed at making germany a more attractive place to do business , particularly for large corporations , who are increasingly moving operations offshore to countries with lower tax rates , and to attract investment .
germany 's current corporate tax rate of just below 39 percent is the highest in the eu .
the new rate would put germany in the middle of the eu field . the moves have been triggered largely by several new eastern european eu members who have slashed their corporate taxes and have become increasingly attractive as places to do business . corporations in poland , for example , pay 17.4 percent ; in estonia , the rate is 23 percent ; and the standard corporate tax in slovakia is fixed at 19 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carmaker volkswagen could see its tax bill fall substantially big german companies such as siemens and volkswagen could pay a fifth less in tax when the measures go into force .
still , the plans are not being met with jubilation from many economists and industry groups .
nor do those on the left politically see much to cheer about . busi n ess n ot exactly cheeri n g for pro-business groups , social democrat steinbrück 's reforms do not go far enough .
plans to broaden the tax base to recoup some of the estimated eight-billion-euro -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- revenue shortfall that would result from the cuts in the first year could cancel any positive effect , they say . " companies wo n't profit very much from these reforms , " said thomas hüne of the bdi federation of german industries .
" while tax rates will be decreased , the tax base will grow , meaning it will be a zero-zero game for german companies . " it is primarily this expansion of the tax base to include interest , rental and leasing income as well as licensing fees that has many business groups unhappy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's rate of 17.4 percent has proven a magnet for business winfried fuest , an economist and partner at the cologne institute of business research , said small and medium-sized companies , which make up the bulk of german companies , would see little , if any , tax relief - largely because of these communal business tax increases that are likely to go into effect as corporate rates are slashed . " we welcome the cut in corporate taxes , of course , but this plan is schizophrenic , " fuest said .
" it just provides relief to high-yield companies .
those who have weaker earnings will likely be looking at an additional tax burden . " he would like to see the communal business tax done away with all together and replaced with another model .
but since it is an important revenue stream for municipalities , they will fight tooth and nail to maintain it , he said . fuest added that his and other business groups would like to see an effective corporate tax rate fall to below 25 percent in order to effectively compete with low-tax countries to the east , although that would entail large-scale cuts in social services . " i 'm too much of a scientist , a realist , to consider that a real possibility , " he said . left-wi n g a n ger criticism of the plan has come from the left as well .
but they argue that the plan is a giveaway to corporations at the expense of everyday citizens , which will be especially painful after the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , a kind of sales tax , rises three percentage points to 19 percent in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vat increase will hit everyone the vat increase was approved by parliament on june 16 and is the country 's biggest tax increase in six decades . " no one is going to have much understanding for the fact that one point of this three-point vat tax is supposed to compensate for a cut in corporate taxes , " said a statement released by the " parliamentary left , " a group of 100 social democrats in the bundestag .
it added that a competition to see who can cut taxes the most is the wrong approach to economic policy . " they 're reaching into the wallets of the little people to give corporations tax relief , " renate künast , green party parliamentary group leader , told reporters . the tax plan is part of a raft of reforms that the governing grand coalition of christian democrats and social democrats are trying to agree upon before parliament begins its summer recess on july 7 . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

qualified spain are so relaxed that fernando torres and others will sit out the saudi arabia game . andriy shevchenko 's timely return to form in ukraine 's 4-0 thrashing of saudi arabia was one of many plus points from a game that has revived the world cup debutants ' campaign to qualify for the last 16 . ukraine , who lost 4-0 to spain in their opener , showed their attacking intent against a toothless saudi team from the start . the match represented a personal triumph for shevchenko , the striker leading the way with a fine individual performance and combining fantastically with attacking team-mates maksym kalinichenko , serhiy rebrov and oleg rusov . it was pressure from shevchenko that forced saudi arabia into conceding the corner from which andriy rusol scored the opening the goal in the fourth minute . shevchenko then opened his own account one minute into the second-half , rising above defender hamad al-montashari to head a home a kalinichenko free-kick and turned provider for the fourth goal , setting up kalinichenko with a beautifully-weighted cross past a despairing mabrouk zaid in goal and three defenders . big win over saudis boosts ukraine 's chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's andriy rusol got the ball and the goals rolling so emphatic was the score line , in fact , that it immediately revived ukraine 's chances of reaching the last 16 , leaving them two points clear of both tunisia and the saudis with a superior goal difference , and within another win of achieving their objective . shevchenko said there was a huge psychological difference between the spain game and that against saudi arabia .
" during the first game we were overawed by the occasion , " he said .

qualified spain are so relaxed that fernando torres and others will sit out the saudi arabia game . andriy shevchenko 's timely return to form in ukraine 's 4-0 thrashing of saudi arabia was one of many plus points from a game that has revived the world cup debutants ' campaign to qualify for the last 16 . ukraine , who lost 4-0 to spain in their opener , showed their attacking intent against a toothless saudi team from the start . the match represented a personal triumph for shevchenko , the striker leading the way with a fine individual performance and combining fantastically with attacking team-mates maksym kalinichenko , serhiy rebrov and oleg rusov . it was pressure from shevchenko that forced saudi arabia into conceding the corner from which andriy rusol scored the opening the goal in the fourth minute . shevchenko then opened his own account one minute into the second-half , rising above defender hamad al-montashari to head a home a kalinichenko free-kick and turned provider for the fourth goal , setting up kalinichenko with a beautifully-weighted cross past a despairing mabrouk zaid in goal and three defenders . big win over saudis boosts ukraine 's chances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's andriy rusol got the ball and the goals rolling so emphatic was the score line , in fact , that it immediately revived ukraine 's chances of reaching the last 16 , leaving them two points clear of both tunisia and the saudis with a superior goal difference , and within another win of achieving their objective . shevchenko said there was a huge psychological difference between the spain game and that against saudi arabia .

switzerland beat south korea to win the group . les bleus finished behind switzerland to earn the second group g spot among the last 16 teams in cologne on friday , winning by the two-goal margin they needed to guarantee a match against spain in the cup 's next round . togo , at their first ever finals , did n't make it easy for the french .
the favored european side failed to convert a hatful of chances in the first 45 minutes , largely thanks to the heroics of kossi agassa in the togo goal . close to the break agassa performed a near miracle to first block florent malouda 's shot then scrambled around to keep out trezeguet 's attempt to knock in the rebound inches from his line . fighting for their world cup lives , raymond domenech 's french side was missing suspended playmaker zinedine zidane and desperately in search of their first world cup win since a 3-0 triumph over brazil eight years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things were n't always so peaceful on the french team before the game france dig deep for chance to play spain domenech admitted that friday 's game " was difficult and i 'll not deny that .
but this team can dig deep .
i am happy for the team .
the next match against spain will be super . " while france will have felt aggrieved not to be ahead at the break , already knocked out togo fulfilled their promise not to make up the numbers , looking dangerous on the counter attack with french keeper fabian barthez having to move smartly to punch clear a shot from mohamed kader . patrick vieira earned man of the match honors on his 30th birthday , taking a pass from frank ribery 10 minutes into the second half and bending it off his right foot into the corner of the net . six minutes later vieira , who has faced criticism for a disappointing start in germany , headed down the ball thierry henry fired into the goal from the middle of the penalty box . swiss send south korea crashing out of cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss defense proved up to what south korea threw at it a controversial 2-0 victory swept switzerland past south korea and into the round of 16 in hanover at a game that ran simultaneously with the togo-france match-up . arsenal defender philippe senderos put switzerland ahead in the first half before striker alexander frei killed the koreans ' hopes of equalizing with a hotly disputed goal in the 77th minute . the korean defense stopped after the assistant referee flagged frei offside but the striker slid the ball home and was delighted when argentine referee horacio elizondo allowed the goal to stand despite furious protests from the whole south korean team . " we played well over the three games , we did n't concede any goals and we scored four , " an optimistic frei said after the game .
" now we 'll try to conquer the world ! " switzerland , who reached the second round in their last appearance in the world cup finals 12 years ago , play their next match against ukraine . korea nearly caught switzerland cold in the third minute with a sweeping move down the left .
lee chun-soo darted into the box but his low cross was just too strong for the onrushing lee ho . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senderos , right , will remember the goal - and the elbow to the head elbow to the head ca n't sink swiss the swiss side surged forward looking for an early goal and tranquillo barnetta had a goal-bound shot blocked by a desperate lunge from veteran defender choi jin-cheul in the ninth minute . the pressure paid off for switzerland in the 23rd minute when they went ahead from a set piece .
hakan yakin fired in a left-footed free kick to the back post and arsenal defender senderos rose high to power a header past lee . senderos clashed heads with choi and blood started to stream down his face but the battling 21-year-old was too overjoyed at scoring his third international goal to feel any pain . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : three playing for group g progress while togo play for pride two teams from south korea , switzerland and france have the chance to make the last 16 of the world cup as group g reaches its conclusion friday .

new borrowing for the current year is at the highest level ever seen in a federal budget . after five days of debate over the budget put forward by finance minister peer steinbrück , the 261.6 billion euro -lrb- $ 327 billion -rrb- package passed with an easy majority in the bundestag . on the final day of debate , steinbrück defended his plan against the opposition 's criticism , saying there was no alternative .
but with new borrowing totals for the current year at 38.2 billion euros - the highest level ever seen in a federal budget and some 7 billion euros more than last year - steinbrück 's package was not without controversy .
germany will now almost certainly run afoul of the european union 's rules on budget deficit levels for the fifth year in a row . " the 2006 budget is a transition budget , also with respect to developments in economic growth , " steinbrück said . he added that the true test of merkel 's coalition government would come with the 2007 budget , in which he foresees new borrowing being drastically reduced to around 20 billion euros . big spending on labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget was late because of the closeness of chancellor merkel 's election victory unsurprisingly perhaps , given germany 's ongoing struggle to rein in unemployment and reform its welfare system , the biggest single item in the budget is 119.5 billion euros earmarked for the ministry for labor and social affairs . this is followed by 27.9 billion euros for the defense ministry , and 23.7 billion euros for infrastructure and transport projects . the budget was six months late in being approved this year because of the long wait to form a new government following last september 's extraordinarily close election results . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german industry irked by slow pace of reforms while most of the country is swept up in world cup fever , that 's not the case for german business leaders .

mr cheney said in washington that the deal was " one of the most important strategic foreign policy initiatives of president bush 's second term " .
the deal would give india access to us nuclear technology .
it reverses us policy , which had restricted nuclear co-operation since india tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
the agreement was finalised during us president george w bush 's visit to india in march . "
we hope congress will move quickly to enact legislation that enables our two nations to move forward on this important agreement without delay " dick cheney under the deal , energy-hungry india will get access to us civil nuclear technology and open its nuclear facilities to inspection .
critics of the deal say it sends the wrong message to countries like iran , whose nuclear ambitions washington opposes .
lobbying " we hope congress will move quickly to enact legislation that enables our two nations to move forward on this important agreement without delay , " cheney was quoted telling a meeting of the most influential american and indian business group in washington by the reuters news agency .
the final vote on the proposed agreement is not expected till the middle of july .
before that , next week , on 27 and 28 june , the proposed deal must go through a rigorous assessment process by the powerful us senate foreign relations committee and the house international relations committee of congress .
the bbc 's shahzeb jilani in washington says lobbying is intensifying to garner support for the deal .
secretary of state condoleezza rice has personally contacted us house of representatives and senators to get them on board while us under secretary of state nicholas burns has been spending a lot of time at the capitol hill to counter opposition to the deal .
our correspondent says opinion is divided in washington on whether the bush administration has the bipartisan support it claims it has on the deal .
critics believe that at a time when stand-off with north korea and iran is deepening , the civilian cooperation deal between us and india severely undermines the global nuclear non-proliferation regime .
opponents of the deal also believe that by creating an exception for india , us is rewarding a country who has so far refused to sign up to the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the bush administration has responded to the criticism by pointing out that under the deal , india will be obliged to open up its civilian nuclear sites to international safeguards under the un nuclear watchdog , the iaea .
" this deal is good for america 's long term interests and it is good for nuclear non-proliferation , " mr burns told the meeting in washington .

mr cheney said in washington that the deal was " one of the most important strategic foreign policy initiatives of president bush 's second term " .
the deal would give india access to us nuclear technology .
it reverses us policy , which had restricted nuclear co-operation since india tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
the agreement was finalised during us president george w bush 's visit to india in march .
we hope congress will move quickly to enact legislation that enables our two nations to move forward on this important agreement without delay dick cheney under the deal , energy-hungry india will get access to us civil nuclear technology and open its nuclear facilities to inspection .
critics of the deal say it sends the wrong message to countries like iran , whose nuclear ambitions washington opposes .
lobbying " we hope congress will move quickly to enact legislation that enables our two nations to move forward on this important agreement without delay , " cheney was quoted telling a meeting of the most influential american and indian business group in washington by the reuters news agency .

opponents of the deal also believe that by creating an exception for india , us is rewarding a country who has so far refused to sign up to the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
the bush administration has responded to the criticism by pointing out that under the deal , india will be obliged to open up its civilian nuclear sites to international safeguards under the un nuclear watchdog , the iaea .
" this deal is good for america 's long term interests and it is good for nuclear non-proliferation , " mr burns told the meeting in washington .

the government panel planning report calls for 505,500 homes to be build in the eastern region by 2021 .
the cpre said this number of homes presented a major threat to the eastern region 's environment .

the rspb says nine white-tailed eagles have been killed on the smola islands off the norwegian coast in 10 months , including all of last year 's chicks .
chick numbers at the species ' former stronghold have plummeted since the wind farm was built , with breeding pairs at the site down from 19 to one .
scientists fear wind farms planned elsewhere could also harm birds .
and there are fears britain 's small population of the birds could be adversely affected .
fewer chicks the number of chicks born each year at the site has fallen from at least 10 to three last year , with births outside the borders of the site falling too .
the impact of wind farms has long been a concern or ornithologists only one chick is expected to fledge from the site this year .
smola , a set of islands 10km -lrb- six miles -rrb- off the north-west coast of norway , was designated an important bird area by birdlife international in 1989 because it had one of the highest densities of white-tailed eagles in the world .
scientists now fear wind farms planned for the rest of norway could have a similar impact on the birds .
rspb conservation director mark avery told bbc news more care needed to be taken when choosing a site for wind farms .
he said : " the problem is if wind farms are put in stupid places where there are lots of vulnerable birds and lots of vulnerable rare birds . "
he said most wind farms would not cause any harm to birds but that the smola wind farm had been badly sited in a place where it put white-tailed eagles at risk .
he added : " it seems these birds are flying around a lot of the time and they 're colliding with the wind turbines and being killed in big numbers .
" so this colony that is very important - was very important - has been practically wiped out because this wind farm was built in exactly the wrong place . "
careful planning urged the rspb says it supports renewable energy , including wind farms , as a way of tackling climate change , which it sees as the biggest threat to wildlife .
but it is urging developers and governments to take the potential impact on wildlife such as eagles properly into consideration when planning new wind farms in future .
researchers are now running weekly checks for dead birds at the 68-turbine smola site , with both conservationists and the wind farm operator calling on the norwegian government to improve its environmental impact assessments of such sites .
and the norwegian institute for nature research has launched a four-year study at the site to assess the impact of the turbines on various species of birds and the ability of white tailed eagles to adapt to them .
meanwhile , statkraft , which operates the smola site , says it is doing everything it can to find a solution to the problem .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- 4x4 drivers ' put others at risk ' bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 23 june 2006 , 07:12 gmt 08:12 uk 4x4 drivers ' put others at risk ' drivers of 4x4s are putting other motorists at risk by flouting mobile phone and seat belt laws , a study says .
imperial college london found 4x4 drivers were four times more likely to use mobile phones than other drivers , while a third more shunned seat belts .
the team , who observed 41,000 motorists , said those in 4x4s took more risks as they felt safer in their cars , the british medical journal reported .
another study also cast doubt on claims by ministers roads are getting safer .
the study by oxford university and the south east regional public health group in guildford found when hospital statistics were used instead of police figures serious injuries caused by road crashes had not changed since 1996 . "
there are still too many people taking unnecessary risks on the roads " roger vincent , of the royal society for the protection of accidents but the government uses police figures to measure its progress towards reducing road deaths and injuries by 40 % by 2010 .
these show a drop of nearly a third , leaving the government on course to hit its target .
lead researcher dr mike gill said : " the discrepancies are likely to be down to under-reporting of accidents to police .
" but it raises questions about the police figures and i think it is important the government looks at the hospital figures . "
road safety minister stephen ladyman said the study was " misleading " .
but it is the study on 4x4 drivers which is set to spark most controversy .
city owners of the vehicles , dubbed chelsea tractors , have been heavily criticised in recent months because they are considered environmental unfriendly .
report author lesley walker said : " although 4x4 vehicles are safer in a crash , their owners may be placing themselves and other road users at increased risk of injury . "
concern but she said the overall levels of law-breaking were also a " major concern " .
almost one in six drivers in total did not wear seat belts , while one in 40 used mobile phones .
but the society of motor manufacturers and traders said the study was " weak " .
a spokesman said : " to assume that drivers are not using seat belts and talking on mobile phones because they feel safer in 4x4s is a huge leap in logic and is not backed by any scientific evidence . "
another report in the bmj also strengthened the link between the risk of driving while feeling sleepy .
in a survey of 13,299 middle-aged drivers , researchers found people who drove while sleepy a few times a year were 1.5 times more likely to be involved in a serious crash than those who did not drive while sleepy .
those who said they drove while sleepy each month were nearly three times more likely to have an accident , the team from the victor segalen university in france said .

imperial college london found 4x4 drivers were four times more likely to use mobile phones than other drivers , while a third more shunned seat belts .
the team , who observed 41,000 motorists , said those in 4x4s took more risks as they felt safer in their cars , the british medical journal reported .
another study also cast doubt on claims by ministers roads are getting safer .
the study by oxford university and the south east regional public health group in guildford found when hospital statistics were used instead of police figures serious injuries caused by road crashes had not changed since 1996 .
there are still too many people taking unnecessary risks on the roads roger vincent , of the royal society for the protection of accidents but the government uses police figures to measure its progress towards reducing road deaths and injuries by 40 % by 2010 .
these show a drop of nearly a third , leaving the government on course to hit its target .
lead researcher dr mike gill said : " the discrepancies are likely to be down to under-reporting of accidents to police .
" but it raises questions about the police figures and i think it is important the government looks at the hospital figures . "
road safety minister stephen ladyman said the study was " misleading " .
but it is the study on 4x4 drivers which is set to spark most controversy .
city owners of the vehicles , dubbed chelsea tractors , have been heavily criticised in recent months because they are considered environmental unfriendly .
report author lesley walker said : " although 4x4 vehicles are safer in a crash , their owners may be placing themselves and other road users at increased risk of injury . "
concern but she said the overall levels of law-breaking were also a " major concern " .
almost one in six drivers in total did not wear seat belts , while one in 40 used mobile phones .
but the society of motor manufacturers and traders said the study was " weak " .
a spokesman said : " to assume that drivers are not using seat belts and talking on mobile phones because they feel safer in 4x4s is a huge leap in logic and is not backed by any scientific evidence . "
another report in the bmj also strengthened the link between the risk of driving while feeling sleepy .
in a survey of 13,299 middle-aged drivers , researchers found people who drove while sleepy a few times a year were 1.5 times more likely to be involved in a serious crash than those who did not drive while sleepy .
those who said they drove while sleepy each month were nearly three times more likely to have an accident , the team from the victor segalen university in france said .

zia trench politics show london the politics show london investigates the claim that londoners pay out far more tax than they get back .
showering me with all sorts of complicated statistics and formulas , i am told that we are subsidising other areas of the united kingdom .
their figures are these : firstly , that londoners make up 12 % of the population and yet our tax-bill accounts for 19 % of government revenue and ... secondly , as a percentage of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- we have much less spent on us than northern ireland , scotland and the north-east of london cash outflow ?
statistics start to get worrying when i am told that £ 15 - £ 20bn flows out of the capital each year - in subsidies to other regions .
where is this figure from ?
london 's chamber of commerce , i am told .
i raise an eyebrow , since they are on the same side .
perhaps a more fair estimate is from the london school of economics that reckons it is about £ 7bn .
some people would say that even this is too much .
business numbers shrinking ?
it is not a new argument ; there have been grumbles about inequity of public spending for years .
what is new , though , is that looking at vat figures , for the first time in a decade , there 's slightly more businesses in central london closing rather than opening .
the idea that businesses are struggling , added to the campaign for the £ 10bn crossrail train link , added to the fact we have five of the 10 poorest boroughs in the country , all fuel the argument that london should be keeping more of its tax-cash .
on the other hand , we are the economic powerhouse of the uk and as such , perhaps it is our duty to help finance less fortunate regions .
the big question , is not perhaps that we should help the rest of the uk , but by how much ?
also this week ...
the thorny issue of the demise of small businesses on london 's high streets .
keen to do something about it , kensington council has launched a commission to see what they can do to stop big businesses taking over our high streets .
as rents and rates go up , it is getting harder for small businesses .
the politics show asks what can be done to protect communities and independent shops from the big buck ?

zia trench politics show london is london the uk 's cash-cow ?
the politics show london investigates the claim that londoners pay out far more tax than they get back .
showering me with all sorts of complicated statistics and formulas , i am told that we are subsidising other areas of the united kingdom .
their figures are these : firstly , that londoners make up 12 % of the population and yet our tax-bill accounts for 19 % of government revenue and ... secondly , as a percentage of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- we have much less spent on us than northern ireland , scotland and the north-east of london cash outflow ?
statistics start to get worrying when i am told that £ 15 - £ 20bn flows out of the capital each year - in subsidies to other regions .
where is this figure from ?
london 's chamber of commerce , i am told .
i raise an eyebrow , since they are on the same side .
perhaps a more fair estimate is from the london school of economics that reckons it is about £ 7bn .
some people would say that even this is too much .
business numbers shrinking ?
it is not a new argument ; there have been grumbles about inequity of public spending for years .
what is new , though , is that looking at vat figures , for the first time in a decade , there 's slightly more businesses in central london closing rather than opening .
the idea that businesses are struggling , added to the campaign for the £ 10bn crossrail train link , added to the fact we have five of the 10 poorest boroughs in the country , all fuel the argument that london should be keeping more of its tax-cash .
on the other hand , we are the economic powerhouse of the uk and as such , perhaps it is our duty to help finance less fortunate regions .
the big question , is not perhaps that we should help the rest of the uk , but by how much ?
also this week ...
the thorny issue of the demise of small businesses on london 's high streets .
keen to do something about it , kensington council has launched a commission to see what they can do to stop big businesses taking over our high streets .
as rents and rates go up , it is getting harder for small businesses .
the politics show asks what can be done to protect communities and independent shops from the big buck ?

i have been thinking some more about the issues raised at the downing street ' civil liberties ' seminar last week and would like to make several points that arose both from the questions you wanted us to consider , and from the discussion that ensued .
in so doing , i shall assume good faith on your part , which is to say i take it that you are interested in thinking seriously about how governments respond to crime , disorder and public insecurity in a liberal democracy and that you are not solely or mainly engaged in an exercise in electoral calculation and political positioning .
let me start by repeating the point i made at the seminar .
our society has since the early 1980s been governed by administrations that have , shall we say , taken law and order extremely seriously , a focus that has become even more emphatic since 1993 .
none of these administrations has been particularly supportive of what the invitation letter revealingly called ' the rights of the criminal ' .
yet you are now asking us to believe that during this period the criminal justice system has become ' unbalanced ' , such that it today unduly privileges the rights of criminals -lrb- we should of course say suspects -rrb- over those of the victim in ways that have led society to be poorly defended against crime .
i simply think you need to offer more serious evidence than any i have seen that this is in fact the case , rather than simply assert that it is so , or that ' the public ' believes it to be so .
one needs also to exercise some care here with the metaphor of ' balance ' .
the idea of balance almost always functions in these discussions as a piece of rhetorical trickery , one that performs no real work in helping us to consider seriously the issues at hand -lrb- who , after all , is in favour of ' imbalance ' ? -rrb- .
it offers no criteria whatsoever for determining what the right ' balance ' looks like , sets up the whole debate as an entirely zero-sum game between ' criminals ' and ' victims ' , and offers no resources for protecting the criminal justice system from utilitarian calculation .
your response to my concerns was that the body politic has to respond to the worries and concerns of citizens and that global economic and social change over the last half century has robbed people of the sense they might once have had that the world is an orderly , secure and civil place .
people , in short , are worried about crime and disorder , feel insecure , and do n't believe the system is doing enough to protect them .
indeed , your thinking about these issues seems to rest heavily on the proposition that public confidence in criminal justice is perilously close to crisis point and that government must act in response .
i agree with you - up to a point .
i do not though draw the conclusions from it that you appear to have reached .
there are of course people who experience daily and debilitating problems of crime and anti-social behaviour - what sir anthony bottoms rightly at the seminar called a problem of civil public space .
there are forms of terrorism and serious and organized crime that we must think seriously and in novel ways about how to tackle .
and there are people whose experience or view of the world leads them to make vociferous and angry demands for the police or courts to do more to protect them .
yet the question of how government can and should respond to these problems and concerns is not , i think , as clear-cut as you appear to be suggesting .
there are members of this society who plainly feel the way you say they do about crime and punishment - angry , let down and demanding of a response .
-lrb- i have over the last decade spent countless hours interviewing people at length about crime and its place in their lives and have heard it all first hand . -rrb-
but i think they are in fact in a minority , albeit one that makes or prompts a lot of noise .
it is also not clear to me that governments can or should respond to their demands in the terms in which they are expressed .
in fact , i rather suspect that such demands may be insatiable if responded to in these terms .
people are also sometimes calling for things that are , to be blunt , not very nice , and which ought not in a liberal democracy to be acceded to .
listening to you speak about these matters , however , you seem to take the view that the role of government is to act as an uncritical cipher for public anger and demands viz. crime and disorder .
it is as if - on this issue at least - you have lost confidence in the capacity of government to engage in a dialogue with people , to point out some facts -lrb- about resource limitations , or the capacity and effects of prisons , or the constraints on what can be done to tackle crime in a liberal democracy -rrb- , to put another view , to be a voice of reason and restraint rather than a conduit or cheer-leader for longer sentences and more punishment .
but this , it seems to me , is precisely the sort of public conversation that our society urgently needs to have about questions of crime , justice and security , a point to which i return shortly .
there is , further , plenty of evidence to suggest that many members of our society do not feel as concerned or angry or let down by the system as you seem to think that they are .
this is the lesson that emerges from the research conducted by mike hough and others which suggests both that people know very little about how the system operates -lrb- why should they ? -rrb- and that they are often less severe than judges when asked how they would sentence in actual cases .
and it is also the lesson of initiatives such as restorative justice , mediation and -lrb- now -rrb- community courts .
put simply , if you ask people about these issues in abstract and general terms -lrb- is the criminal justice system failing ? is the human rights act silly ? are young people today out of control ? -rrb- they are likely to supply you with an affirmative - and often bewildered or angry - answer .
but if you present them with real cases , or ask them about the youths on the corner , or engage them in problem-solving at local level , they are much less likely to think , sound and act like ' the public ' that you believe the body politic needs pressingly to respond to .
my question then is this : why do you seem so unwilling to take this evidence seriously and use it as the basis for constructing an altogether different narrative about crime -lrb- which after all has been going down for over a decade -rrb- ?
do you not believe it ?
or has it become simply too risky politically for government -lrb- perhaps any government -rrb- to accept and act upon it ?
let me add one further observation .
i said earlier that i think your starting premise is the right one - namely , that people are concerned abut criminal justice partly because they lack a broader or deeper sense of ontological security .
crime and anti-social behaviour seem , in other words , to condense many of the anxieties that flow from living in what giddens calls a ' runaway world ' .
but if this is true , one is n't going to tackle the problem you have identified with a prime ministerial statement on , and yet more legislation about , the criminal justice system .
it is like putting a plaster on a broken leg .
my worry here is several fold : first , i think the government is in danger of over-investing in criminal justice and forgetting the lesson that we tell every novice criminology student - namely , that policing , criminal justice and punishment have an important but ultimately small and peripheral part to play in the production of orderly societies ; second ; it often sounds as if you think the criminal justice system is a delivery arm of government .
but it is n't .
i know this must seem frustrating from where you sit , but courts are meant to function as checks and constraints , both on government over-zealousness and on police forces who may too easily presume to know that they have ' got the right person ' .
third , you run the risk , once again , of raising public expectations in what the criminal justice system can deliver in ways that risk the government being hoist by it own petard , and which do nothing to break the vicious circle of scandal , media frenzy and ' firm ' government response that has come to surround this area of public policy making in the last decade .
so what would i do ?
let me offer three broad suggestions , or orientations .
last year you delivered a lecture to the institute of public policy research on risk and public policy .
it was full of extremely sensible statements to the effect that ' government can not eliminate all risk ' , that ' not every scandal requires a regulatory response ' , that ' we need to involve the media in a better dialogue about risk ' , and that ' we can not eliminate risk .
we have to live with it , manage it ' .
this , it seems to me , offers a better starting point for thinking about crime , disorder and terrorism than the one that government seems currently to apply to crime risks .
i know this is hard -lrb- though you said it was hard in relation to risks generally -rrb- , not least because crime has a moral and emotional resonance that other risks seem not to possess , at least at first blush .
but tackling crime , or anti-social behaviour , or terrorism , in ways that are consistent with living in and sustaining a decent , civilized , liberal democratic society requires us not to speak of ' eradication ' -lrb- the term you resorted to when launching the respect agenda -rrb- , but of addressing problems in ways that that enable citizens to live securely with risk .
this of course means finding effective measures to reduce the level of objective risk .
but it also means doing so in ways that enable all citizens to feel secure - a condition which flows in large measure from their sense that government , and the police and criminal justice system , recognize their legitimate concerns and entitlements and routinely affirm their sense of confident , effortless belonging to a democratic political community .
this , above all , means having a dialogue with citizens about the problems we confront and what can reasonably be done and not done to tackle them , rather than seeking uncritically to satisfy the demands of dissatisfied consumers .
what follows from this : concentrate on discovering , funding , delivering and explaining to people programmes that work -lrb- whether in terms of prison education , or reassurance policing , or better detection - polly toynbee was right about this -lrb- guardian , 9 june -rrb- , while , at the same time , seeking to reduce the political and media heat that has come to surround crime and punishment .
this has become , under your government , an area of legislative hyperactivity -lrb- with in excess of 40 acts of parliament passed in this field since 1997 -rrb- , and endless proclamations of intent .
as an observer , i confess this has left me somewhat baffled - activity that seems to have more to do with the imperatives of electoral competition than a serious effort to address problems of crime and disorder .
it may even be - as the home office has found to its cost in recent weeks - that the dizzying pace of new initiatives has made it more difficult to keep one 's eye on the ball of sound administration and delivering programmes that stand some chance of achieving positive results on the ground .
so i guess my suggestion is this : think hard before deciding that what our society needs right now is another grand statement of governmental purpose and a further round of headline-grabbing legislation ; or at the very least think carefully about the kind of message you wish to send , lest you end up inadvertently reinforcing , or even stirring up , the very concerns you think government needs to assuage .
might , in fact , it be better to begin to think instead about how to dismount the tiger that politicians have in recent years collectively convinced themselves they have no alternative but to ride .
please , finally , try to find another - more responsible , more compelling , more solidaristic - language for talking about human rights .
it strikes me that you - and the henry porter 's of the world - have got into the habit of thinking about rights in overly individualistic terms .
rights , in other worlds , are thing that protect the individual from the power of the mighty , overweening state .
the ' civil liberties ' lobby defends rights to the hilt on this basis , while seeming to have little to say about security .
your government , by contrast , seems to have convinced itself that rights exist for a minority , and that too often they protect ' others ' who are undeserving , or else threatening of ' our ' security .
hence , presumably , all the recent sideswipes at the human rights act .
it is worth recalling here that politicians nearly always -lrb- can you think of a counter example ? -rrb- become less concerned about protecting civil liberties once they enter government , something which suggests that what changes is less the ' facts ' on the ground and more the peculiarity of the perspective from which they come to view them .
what is forgotten on both sides of this debate is that human rights , or any of the other checks and protections that ' we ' build into the criminal justice system , exist not only or even mainly to protect individuals , deserving or otherwise .
they are rather , the mark of a decent , civilized society and as such things that we have a collective stake in being proud of and defending .
rights , in short , are preconditions for the police and justice system being able to contribute positively to citizen security in a democratic society , and they ought to be articulated and defended as such .
i rather suspect that you and i do not see entirely eye-to-eye on these matters , something that may -lrb- or may not -rrb- be a product of the respective places from which we approach them .
i nonetheless hope that you find these reflections of some assistance in helping you to come to a settled view on these vital matters .

there are members of this society who plainly feel the way you say they do about crime and punishment - angry , let down and demanding of a response .
-lrb- i have over the last decade spent countless hours interviewing people at length about crime and its place in their lives and have heard it all first hand . -rrb-
but i think they are in fact in a minority , albeit one that makes or prompts a lot of noise .
it is also not clear to me that governments can or should respond to their demands in the terms in which they are expressed .
in fact , i rather suspect that such demands may be insatiable if responded to in these terms .
people are also sometimes calling for things that are , to be blunt , not very nice , and which ought not in a liberal democracy to be acceded to .
listening to you speak about these matters , however , you seem to take the view that the role of government is to act as an uncritical cipher for public anger and demands viz. crime and disorder .
it is as if - on this issue at least - you have lost confidence in the capacity of government to engage in a dialogue with people , to point out some facts -lrb- about resource limitations , or the capacity and effects of prisons , or the constraints on what can be done to tackle crime in a liberal democracy -rrb- , to put another view , to be a voice of reason and restraint rather than a conduit or cheer-leader for longer sentences and more punishment .
but this , it seems to me , is precisely the sort of public conversation that our society urgently needs to have about questions of crime , justice and security , a point to which i return shortly .
there is , further , plenty of evidence to suggest that many members of our society do not feel as concerned or angry or let down by the system as you seem to think that they are .
this is the lesson that emerges from the research conducted by mike hough and others which suggests both that people know very little about how the system operates -lrb- why should they ? -rrb- and that they are often less severe than judges when asked how they would sentence in actual cases .
and it is also the lesson of initiatives such as restorative justice , mediation and -lrb- now -rrb- community courts .
put simply , if you ask people about these issues in abstract and general terms -lrb- is the criminal justice system failing ? is the human rights act silly ? are young people today out of control ? -rrb- they are likely to supply you with an affirmative - and often bewildered or angry - answer .
but if you present them with real cases , or ask them about the youths on the corner , or engage them in problem-solving at local level , they are much less likely to think , sound and act like ' the public ' that you believe the body politic needs pressingly to respond to .
my question then is this : why do you seem so unwilling to take this evidence seriously and use it as the basis for constructing an altogether different narrative about crime -lrb- which after all has been going down for over a decade -rrb- ?
do you not believe it ?
or has it become simply too risky politically for government -lrb- perhaps any government -rrb- to accept and act upon it ?
let me add one further observation .
i said earlier that i think your starting premise is the right one - namely , that people are concerned abut criminal justice partly because they lack a broader or deeper sense of ontological security .
crime and anti-social behaviour seem , in other words , to condense many of the anxieties that flow from living in what giddens calls a ' runaway world ' .
but if this is true , one is n't going to tackle the problem you have identified with a prime ministerial statement on , and yet more legislation about , the criminal justice system .
it is like putting a plaster on a broken leg .
my worry here is several fold : first , i think the government is in danger of over-investing in criminal justice and forgetting the lesson that we tell every novice criminology student - namely , that policing , criminal justice and punishment have an important but ultimately small and peripheral part to play in the production of orderly societies ; second ; it often sounds as if you think the criminal justice system is a delivery arm of government .
but it is n't .
i know this must seem frustrating from where you sit , but courts are meant to function as checks and constraints , both on government over-zealousness and on police forces who may too easily presume to know that they have ' got the right person ' .
third , you run the risk , once again , of raising public expectations in what the criminal justice system can deliver in ways that risk the government being hoist by it own petard , and which do nothing to break the vicious circle of scandal , media frenzy and ' firm ' government response that has come to surround this area of public policy making in the last decade .
so what would i do ?
let me offer three broad suggestions , or orientations .
last year you delivered a lecture to the institute of public policy research on risk and public policy .
it was full of extremely sensible statements to the effect that ' government can not eliminate all risk ' , that ' not every scandal requires a regulatory response ' , that ' we need to involve the media in a better dialogue about risk ' , and that ' we can not eliminate risk .
we have to live with it , manage it ' .
this , it seems to me , offers a better starting point for thinking about crime , disorder and terrorism than the one that government seems currently to apply to crime risks .
i know this is hard -lrb- though you said it was hard in relation to risks generally -rrb- , not least because crime has a moral and emotional resonance that other risks seem not to possess , at least at first blush .
but tackling crime , or anti-social behaviour , or terrorism , in ways that are consistent with living in and sustaining a decent , civilized , liberal democratic society requires us not to speak of ' eradication ' -lrb- the term you resorted to when launching the respect agenda -rrb- , but of addressing problems in ways that that enable citizens to live securely with risk .
this of course means finding effective measures to reduce the level of objective risk .
but it also means doing so in ways that enable all citizens to feel secure - a condition which flows in large measure from their sense that government , and the police and criminal justice system , recognize their legitimate concerns and entitlements and routinely affirm their sense of confident , effortless belonging to a democratic political community .
this , above all , means having a dialogue with citizens about the problems we confront and what can reasonably be done and not done to tackle them , rather than seeking uncritically to satisfy the demands of dissatisfied consumers .
what follows from this : concentrate on discovering , funding , delivering and explaining to people programmes that work -lrb- whether in terms of prison education , or reassurance policing , or better detection - polly toynbee was right about this -lrb- guardian , 9 june -rrb- , while , at the same time , seeking to reduce the political and media heat that has come to surround crime and punishment .
this has become , under your government , an area of legislative hyperactivity -lrb- with in excess of 40 acts of parliament passed in this field since 1997 -rrb- , and endless proclamations of intent .
as an observer , i confess this has left me somewhat baffled - activity that seems to have more to do with the imperatives of electoral competition than a serious effort to address problems of crime and disorder .
it may even be - as the home office has found to its cost in recent weeks - that the dizzying pace of new initiatives has made it more difficult to keep one 's eye on the ball of sound administration and delivering programmes that stand some chance of achieving positive results on the ground .
so i guess my suggestion is this : think hard before deciding that what our society needs right now is another grand statement of governmental purpose and a further round of headline-grabbing legislation ; or at the very least think carefully about the kind of message you wish to send , lest you end up inadvertently reinforcing , or even stirring up , the very concerns you think government needs to assuage .
might , in fact , it be better to begin to think instead about how to dismount the tiger that politicians have in recent years collectively convinced themselves they have no alternative but to ride .
please , finally , try to find another - more responsible , more compelling , more solidaristic - language for talking about human rights .
it strikes me that you - and the henry porter 's of the world - have got into the habit of thinking about rights in overly individualistic terms .
rights , in other worlds , are thing that protect the individual from the power of the mighty , overweening state .
the ' civil liberties ' lobby defends rights to the hilt on this basis , while seeming to have little to say about security .
your government , by contrast , seems to have convinced itself that rights exist for a minority , and that too often they protect ' others ' who are undeserving , or else threatening of ' our ' security .
hence , presumably , all the recent sideswipes at the human rights act .
it is worth recalling here that politicians nearly always -lrb- can you think of a counter example ? -rrb- become less concerned about protecting civil liberties once they enter government , something which suggests that what changes is less the ' facts ' on the ground and more the peculiarity of the perspective from which they come to view them .
what is forgotten on both sides of this debate is that human rights , or any of the other checks and protections that ' we ' build into the criminal justice system , exist not only or even mainly to protect individuals , deserving or otherwise .
they are rather , the mark of a decent , civilized society and as such things that we have a collective stake in being proud of and defending .
rights , in short , are preconditions for the police and justice system being able to contribute positively to citizen security in a democratic society , and they ought to be articulated and defended as such .
i rather suspect that you and i do not see entirely eye-to-eye on these matters , something that may -lrb- or may not -rrb- be a product of the respective places from which we approach them .
i nonetheless hope that you find these reflections of some assistance in helping you to come to a settled view on these vital matters .

i have been thinking some more about the issues raised at the downing street ' civil liberties ' seminar last week and would like to make several points that arose both from the questions you wanted us to consider , and from the discussion that ensued .
in so doing , i shall assume good faith on your part , which is to say i take it that you are interested in thinking seriously about how governments respond to crime , disorder and public insecurity in a liberal democracy and that you are not solely or mainly engaged in an exercise in electoral calculation and political positioning .
let me start by repeating the point i made at the seminar .
our society has since the early 1980s been governed by administrations that have , shall we say , taken law and order extremely seriously , a focus that has become even more emphatic since 1993 .
none of these administrations has been particularly supportive of what the invitation letter revealingly called ' the rights of the criminal ' .
yet you are now asking us to believe that during this period the criminal justice system has become ' unbalanced ' , such that it today unduly privileges the rights of criminals -lrb- we should of course say suspects -rrb- over those of the victim in ways that have led society to be poorly defended against crime .
i simply think you need to offer more serious evidence than any i have seen that this is in fact the case , rather than simply assert that it is so , or that ' the public ' believes it to be so .
one needs also to exercise some care here with the metaphor of ' balance ' .
the idea of balance almost always functions in these discussions as a piece of rhetorical trickery , one that performs no real work in helping us to consider seriously the issues at hand -lrb- who , after all , is in favour of ' imbalance ' ? -rrb- .
it offers no criteria whatsoever for determining what the right ' balance ' looks like , sets up the whole debate as an entirely zero-sum game between ' criminals ' and ' victims ' , and offers no resources for protecting the criminal justice system from utilitarian calculation .
your response to my concerns was that the body politic has to respond to the worries and concerns of citizens and that global economic and social change over the last half century has robbed people of the sense they might once have had that the world is an orderly , secure and civil place .
people , in short , are worried about crime and disorder , feel insecure , and do n't believe the system is doing enough to protect them .
indeed , your thinking about these issues seems to rest heavily on the proposition that public confidence in criminal justice is perilously close to crisis point and that government must act in response .
i agree with you - up to a point .
i do not though draw the conclusions from it that you appear to have reached .
there are of course people who experience daily and debilitating problems of crime and anti-social behaviour - what sir anthony bottoms rightly at the seminar called a problem of civil public space .
there are forms of terrorism and serious and organized crime that we must think seriously and in novel ways about how to tackle .
and there are people whose experience or view of the world leads them to make vociferous and angry demands for the police or courts to do more to protect them .
yet the question of how government can and should respond to these problems and concerns is not , i think , as clear-cut as you appear to be suggesting .

my worry here is several fold : first , i think the government is in danger of over-investing in criminal justice and forgetting the lesson that we tell every novice criminology student - namely , that policing , criminal justice and punishment have an important but ultimately small and peripheral part to play in the production of orderly societies ; second ; it often sounds as if you think the criminal justice system is a delivery arm of government .
but it is n't .
i know this must seem frustrating from where you sit , but courts are meant to function as checks and constraints , both on government over-zealousness and on police forces who may too easily presume to know that they have ' got the right person ' .
third , you run the risk , once again , of raising public expectations in what the criminal justice system can deliver in ways that risk the government being hoist by it own petard , and which do nothing to break the vicious circle of scandal , media frenzy and ' firm ' government response that has come to surround this area of public policy making in the last decade .
so what would i do ?
let me offer three broad suggestions , or orientations .
last year you delivered a lecture to the institute of public policy research on risk and public policy .
it was full of extremely sensible statements to the effect that ' government can not eliminate all risk ' , that ' not every scandal requires a regulatory response ' , that ' we need to involve the media in a better dialogue about risk ' , and that ' we can not eliminate risk .
we have to live with it , manage it ' .
this , it seems to me , offers a better starting point for thinking about crime , disorder and terrorism than the one that government seems currently to apply to crime risks .
i know this is hard -lrb- though you said it was hard in relation to risks generally -rrb- , not least because crime has a moral and emotional resonance that other risks seem not to possess , at least at first blush .
but tackling crime , or anti-social behaviour , or terrorism , in ways that are consistent with living in and sustaining a decent , civilized , liberal democratic society requires us not to speak of ' eradication ' -lrb- the term you resorted to when launching the respect agenda -rrb- , but of addressing problems in ways that that enable citizens to live securely with risk .
this of course means finding effective measures to reduce the level of objective risk .
but it also means doing so in ways that enable all citizens to feel secure - a condition which flows in large measure from their sense that government , and the police and criminal justice system , recognize their legitimate concerns and entitlements and routinely affirm their sense of confident , effortless belonging to a democratic political community .
this , above all , means having a dialogue with citizens about the problems we confront and what can reasonably be done and not done to tackle them , rather than seeking uncritically to satisfy the demands of dissatisfied consumers .
what follows from this : concentrate on discovering , funding , delivering and explaining to people programmes that work -lrb- whether in terms of prison education , or reassurance policing , or better detection - polly toynbee was right about this -lrb- guardian , 9 june -rrb- , while , at the same time , seeking to reduce the political and media heat that has come to surround crime and punishment .
this has become , under your government , an area of legislative hyperactivity -lrb- with in excess of 40 acts of parliament passed in this field since 1997 -rrb- , and endless proclamations of intent .
as an observer , i confess this has left me somewhat baffled - activity that seems to have more to do with the imperatives of electoral competition than a serious effort to address problems of crime and disorder .
it may even be - as the home office has found to its cost in recent weeks - that the dizzying pace of new initiatives has made it more difficult to keep one 's eye on the ball of sound administration and delivering programmes that stand some chance of achieving positive results on the ground .
so i guess my suggestion is this : think hard before deciding that what our society needs right now is another grand statement of governmental purpose and a further round of headline-grabbing legislation ; or at the very least think carefully about the kind of message you wish to send , lest you end up inadvertently reinforcing , or even stirring up , the very concerns you think government needs to assuage .
might , in fact , it be better to begin to think instead about how to dismount the tiger that politicians have in recent years collectively convinced themselves they have no alternative but to ride .
please , finally , try to find another - more responsible , more compelling , more solidaristic - language for talking about human rights .
it strikes me that you - and the henry porter 's of the world - have got into the habit of thinking about rights in overly individualistic terms .
rights , in other worlds , are thing that protect the individual from the power of the mighty , overweening state .
the ' civil liberties ' lobby defends rights to the hilt on this basis , while seeming to have little to say about security .
your government , by contrast , seems to have convinced itself that rights exist for a minority , and that too often they protect ' others ' who are undeserving , or else threatening of ' our ' security .
hence , presumably , all the recent sideswipes at the human rights act .
it is worth recalling here that politicians nearly always -lrb- can you think of a counter example ? -rrb- become less concerned about protecting civil liberties once they enter government , something which suggests that what changes is less the ' facts ' on the ground and more the peculiarity of the perspective from which they come to view them .
what is forgotten on both sides of this debate is that human rights , or any of the other checks and protections that ' we ' build into the criminal justice system , exist not only or even mainly to protect individuals , deserving or otherwise .
they are rather , the mark of a decent , civilized society and as such things that we have a collective stake in being proud of and defending .
rights , in short , are preconditions for the police and justice system being able to contribute positively to citizen security in a democratic society , and they ought to be articulated and defended as such .
i rather suspect that you and i do not see entirely eye-to-eye on these matters , something that may -lrb- or may not -rrb- be a product of the respective places from which we approach them .
i nonetheless hope that you find these reflections of some assistance in helping you to come to a settled view on these vital matters .

i have been thinking some more about the issues raised at the downing street ' civil liberties ' seminar last week and would like to make several points that arose both from the questions you wanted us to consider , and from the discussion that ensued .
in so doing , i shall assume good faith on your part , which is to say i take it that you are interested in thinking seriously about how governments respond to crime , disorder and public insecurity in a liberal democracy and that you are not solely or mainly engaged in an exercise in electoral calculation and political positioning .
let me start by repeating the point i made at the seminar .
our society has since the early 1980s been governed by administrations that have , shall we say , taken law and order extremely seriously , a focus that has become even more emphatic since 1993 .
none of these administrations has been particularly supportive of what the invitation letter revealingly called ' the rights of the criminal ' .
yet you are now asking us to believe that during this period the criminal justice system has become ' unbalanced ' , such that it today unduly privileges the rights of criminals -lrb- we should of course say suspects -rrb- over those of the victim in ways that have led society to be poorly defended against crime .
i simply think you need to offer more serious evidence than any i have seen that this is in fact the case , rather than simply assert that it is so , or that ' the public ' believes it to be so .
one needs also to exercise some care here with the metaphor of ' balance ' .
the idea of balance almost always functions in these discussions as a piece of rhetorical trickery , one that performs no real work in helping us to consider seriously the issues at hand -lrb- who , after all , is in favour of ' imbalance ' ? -rrb- .
it offers no criteria whatsoever for determining what the right ' balance ' looks like , sets up the whole debate as an entirely zero-sum game between ' criminals ' and ' victims ' , and offers no resources for protecting the criminal justice system from utilitarian calculation .
your response to my concerns was that the body politic has to respond to the worries and concerns of citizens and that global economic and social change over the last half century has robbed people of the sense they might once have had that the world is an orderly , secure and civil place .
people , in short , are worried about crime and disorder , feel insecure , and do n't believe the system is doing enough to protect them .
indeed , your thinking about these issues seems to rest heavily on the proposition that public confidence in criminal justice is perilously close to crisis point and that government must act in response .
i agree with you - up to a point .
i do not though draw the conclusions from it that you appear to have reached .
there are of course people who experience daily and debilitating problems of crime and anti-social behaviour - what sir anthony bottoms rightly at the seminar called a problem of civil public space .
there are forms of terrorism and serious and organized crime that we must think seriously and in novel ways about how to tackle .
and there are people whose experience or view of the world leads them to make vociferous and angry demands for the police or courts to do more to protect them .
yet the question of how government can and should respond to these problems and concerns is not , i think , as clear-cut as you appear to be suggesting .
there are members of this society who plainly feel the way you say they do about crime and punishment - angry , let down and demanding of a response .
-lrb- i have over the last decade spent countless hours interviewing people at length about crime and its place in their lives and have heard it all first hand . -rrb-
but i think they are in fact in a minority , albeit one that makes or prompts a lot of noise .
it is also not clear to me that governments can or should respond to their demands in the terms in which they are expressed .
in fact , i rather suspect that such demands may be insatiable if responded to in these terms .
people are also sometimes calling for things that are , to be blunt , not very nice , and which ought not in a liberal democracy to be acceded to .
listening to you speak about these matters , however , you seem to take the view that the role of government is to act as an uncritical cipher for public anger and demands viz. crime and disorder .
it is as if - on this issue at least - you have lost confidence in the capacity of government to engage in a dialogue with people , to point out some facts -lrb- about resource limitations , or the capacity and effects of prisons , or the constraints on what can be done to tackle crime in a liberal democracy -rrb- , to put another view , to be a voice of reason and restraint rather than a conduit or cheer-leader for longer sentences and more punishment .
but this , it seems to me , is precisely the sort of public conversation that our society urgently needs to have about questions of crime , justice and security , a point to which i return shortly .
there is , further , plenty of evidence to suggest that many members of our society do not feel as concerned or angry or let down by the system as you seem to think that they are .
this is the lesson that emerges from the research conducted by mike hough and others which suggests both that people know very little about how the system operates -lrb- why should they ? -rrb- and that they are often less severe than judges when asked how they would sentence in actual cases .
and it is also the lesson of initiatives such as restorative justice , mediation and -lrb- now -rrb- community courts .
put simply , if you ask people about these issues in abstract and general terms -lrb- is the criminal justice system failing ? is the human rights act silly ? are young people today out of control ? -rrb- they are likely to supply you with an affirmative - and often bewildered or angry - answer .
but if you present them with real cases , or ask them about the youths on the corner , or engage them in problem-solving at local level , they are much less likely to think , sound and act like ' the public ' that you believe the body politic needs pressingly to respond to .
my question then is this : why do you seem so unwilling to take this evidence seriously and use it as the basis for constructing an altogether different narrative about crime -lrb- which after all has been going down for over a decade -rrb- ?
do you not believe it ?
or has it become simply too risky politically for government -lrb- perhaps any government -rrb- to accept and act upon it ?
let me add one further observation .
i said earlier that i think your starting premise is the right one - namely , that people are concerned abut criminal justice partly because they lack a broader or deeper sense of ontological security .
crime and anti-social behaviour seem , in other words , to condense many of the anxieties that flow from living in what giddens calls a ' runaway world ' .
but if this is true , one is n't going to tackle the problem you have identified with a prime ministerial statement on , and yet more legislation about , the criminal justice system .
it is like putting a plaster on a broken leg .
my worry here is several fold : first , i think the government is in danger of over-investing in criminal justice and forgetting the lesson that we tell every novice criminology student - namely , that policing , criminal justice and punishment have an important but ultimately small and peripheral part to play in the production of orderly societies ; second ; it often sounds as if you think the criminal justice system is a delivery arm of government .

might , in fact , it be better to begin to think instead about how to dismount the tiger that politicians have in recent years collectively convinced themselves they have no alternative but to ride .
please , finally , try to find another - more responsible , more compelling , more solidaristic - language for talking about human rights .
it strikes me that you - and the henry porter 's of the world - have got into the habit of thinking about rights in overly individualistic terms .
rights , in other worlds , are thing that protect the individual from the power of the mighty , overweening state .
the ' civil liberties ' lobby defends rights to the hilt on this basis , while seeming to have little to say about security .
your government , by contrast , seems to have convinced itself that rights exist for a minority , and that too often they protect ' others ' who are undeserving , or else threatening of ' our ' security .
hence , presumably , all the recent sideswipes at the human rights act .
it is worth recalling here that politicians nearly always -lrb- can you think of a counter example ? -rrb- become less concerned about protecting civil liberties once they enter government , something which suggests that what changes is less the ' facts ' on the ground and more the peculiarity of the perspective from which they come to view them .
what is forgotten on both sides of this debate is that human rights , or any of the other checks and protections that ' we ' build into the criminal justice system , exist not only or even mainly to protect individuals , deserving or otherwise .
they are rather , the mark of a decent , civilized society and as such things that we have a collective stake in being proud of and defending .
rights , in short , are preconditions for the police and justice system being able to contribute positively to citizen security in a democratic society , and they ought to be articulated and defended as such .
i rather suspect that you and i do not see entirely eye-to-eye on these matters , something that may -lrb- or may not -rrb- be a product of the respective places from which we approach them .
i nonetheless hope that you find these reflections of some assistance in helping you to come to a settled view on these vital matters .

i have been thinking some more about the issues raised at the downing street ' civil liberties ' seminar last week and would like to make several points that arose both from the questions you wanted us to consider , and from the discussion that ensued .
in so doing , i shall assume good faith on your part , which is to say i take it that you are interested in thinking seriously about how governments respond to crime , disorder and public insecurity in a liberal democracy and that you are not solely or mainly engaged in an exercise in electoral calculation and political positioning .
let me start by repeating the point i made at the seminar .
our society has since the early 1980s been governed by administrations that have , shall we say , taken law and order extremely seriously , a focus that has become even more emphatic since 1993 .
none of these administrations has been particularly supportive of what the invitation letter revealingly called ' the rights of the criminal ' .
yet you are now asking us to believe that during this period the criminal justice system has become ' unbalanced ' , such that it today unduly privileges the rights of criminals -lrb- we should of course say suspects -rrb- over those of the victim in ways that have led society to be poorly defended against crime .
i simply think you need to offer more serious evidence than any i have seen that this is in fact the case , rather than simply assert that it is so , or that ' the public ' believes it to be so .
one needs also to exercise some care here with the metaphor of ' balance ' .
the idea of balance almost always functions in these discussions as a piece of rhetorical trickery , one that performs no real work in helping us to consider seriously the issues at hand -lrb- who , after all , is in favour of ' imbalance ' ? -rrb- .
it offers no criteria whatsoever for determining what the right ' balance ' looks like , sets up the whole debate as an entirely zero-sum game between ' criminals ' and ' victims ' , and offers no resources for protecting the criminal justice system from utilitarian calculation .
your response to my concerns was that the body politic has to respond to the worries and concerns of citizens and that global economic and social change over the last half century has robbed people of the sense they might once have had that the world is an orderly , secure and civil place .
people , in short , are worried about crime and disorder , feel insecure , and do n't believe the system is doing enough to protect them .
indeed , your thinking about these issues seems to rest heavily on the proposition that public confidence in criminal justice is perilously close to crisis point and that government must act in response .
i agree with you - up to a point .
i do not though draw the conclusions from it that you appear to have reached .
there are of course people who experience daily and debilitating problems of crime and anti-social behaviour - what sir anthony bottoms rightly at the seminar called a problem of civil public space .
there are forms of terrorism and serious and organized crime that we must think seriously and in novel ways about how to tackle .
and there are people whose experience or view of the world leads them to make vociferous and angry demands for the police or courts to do more to protect them .
yet the question of how government can and should respond to these problems and concerns is not , i think , as clear-cut as you appear to be suggesting .
there are members of this society who plainly feel the way you say they do about crime and punishment - angry , let down and demanding of a response .
-lrb- i have over the last decade spent countless hours interviewing people at length about crime and its place in their lives and have heard it all first hand . -rrb-
but i think they are in fact in a minority , albeit one that makes or prompts a lot of noise .
it is also not clear to me that governments can or should respond to their demands in the terms in which they are expressed .
in fact , i rather suspect that such demands may be insatiable if responded to in these terms .
people are also sometimes calling for things that are , to be blunt , not very nice , and which ought not in a liberal democracy to be acceded to .
listening to you speak about these matters , however , you seem to take the view that the role of government is to act as an uncritical cipher for public anger and demands viz. crime and disorder .
it is as if - on this issue at least - you have lost confidence in the capacity of government to engage in a dialogue with people , to point out some facts -lrb- about resource limitations , or the capacity and effects of prisons , or the constraints on what can be done to tackle crime in a liberal democracy -rrb- , to put another view , to be a voice of reason and restraint rather than a conduit or cheer-leader for longer sentences and more punishment .
but this , it seems to me , is precisely the sort of public conversation that our society urgently needs to have about questions of crime , justice and security , a point to which i return shortly .
there is , further , plenty of evidence to suggest that many members of our society do not feel as concerned or angry or let down by the system as you seem to think that they are .
this is the lesson that emerges from the research conducted by mike hough and others which suggests both that people know very little about how the system operates -lrb- why should they ? -rrb- and that they are often less severe than judges when asked how they would sentence in actual cases .
and it is also the lesson of initiatives such as restorative justice , mediation and -lrb- now -rrb- community courts .
put simply , if you ask people about these issues in abstract and general terms -lrb- is the criminal justice system failing ? is the human rights act silly ? are young people today out of control ? -rrb- they are likely to supply you with an affirmative - and often bewildered or angry - answer .
but if you present them with real cases , or ask them about the youths on the corner , or engage them in problem-solving at local level , they are much less likely to think , sound and act like ' the public ' that you believe the body politic needs pressingly to respond to .
my question then is this : why do you seem so unwilling to take this evidence seriously and use it as the basis for constructing an altogether different narrative about crime -lrb- which after all has been going down for over a decade -rrb- ?
do you not believe it ?
or has it become simply too risky politically for government -lrb- perhaps any government -rrb- to accept and act upon it ?
let me add one further observation .
i said earlier that i think your starting premise is the right one - namely , that people are concerned abut criminal justice partly because they lack a broader or deeper sense of ontological security .
crime and anti-social behaviour seem , in other words , to condense many of the anxieties that flow from living in what giddens calls a ' runaway world ' .
but if this is true , one is n't going to tackle the problem you have identified with a prime ministerial statement on , and yet more legislation about , the criminal justice system .
it is like putting a plaster on a broken leg .
my worry here is several fold : first , i think the government is in danger of over-investing in criminal justice and forgetting the lesson that we tell every novice criminology student - namely , that policing , criminal justice and punishment have an important but ultimately small and peripheral part to play in the production of orderly societies ; second ; it often sounds as if you think the criminal justice system is a delivery arm of government .
but it is n't .
i know this must seem frustrating from where you sit , but courts are meant to function as checks and constraints , both on government over-zealousness and on police forces who may too easily presume to know that they have ' got the right person ' .
third , you run the risk , once again , of raising public expectations in what the criminal justice system can deliver in ways that risk the government being hoist by it own petard , and which do nothing to break the vicious circle of scandal , media frenzy and ' firm ' government response that has come to surround this area of public policy making in the last decade .
so what would i do ?
let me offer three broad suggestions , or orientations .
last year you delivered a lecture to the institute of public policy research on risk and public policy .
it was full of extremely sensible statements to the effect that ' government can not eliminate all risk ' , that ' not every scandal requires a regulatory response ' , that ' we need to involve the media in a better dialogue about risk ' , and that ' we can not eliminate risk .
we have to live with it , manage it ' .
this , it seems to me , offers a better starting point for thinking about crime , disorder and terrorism than the one that government seems currently to apply to crime risks .
i know this is hard -lrb- though you said it was hard in relation to risks generally -rrb- , not least because crime has a moral and emotional resonance that other risks seem not to possess , at least at first blush .
but tackling crime , or anti-social behaviour , or terrorism , in ways that are consistent with living in and sustaining a decent , civilized , liberal democratic society requires us not to speak of ' eradication ' -lrb- the term you resorted to when launching the respect agenda -rrb- , but of addressing problems in ways that that enable citizens to live securely with risk .
this of course means finding effective measures to reduce the level of objective risk .
but it also means doing so in ways that enable all citizens to feel secure - a condition which flows in large measure from their sense that government , and the police and criminal justice system , recognize their legitimate concerns and entitlements and routinely affirm their sense of confident , effortless belonging to a democratic political community .
this , above all , means having a dialogue with citizens about the problems we confront and what can reasonably be done and not done to tackle them , rather than seeking uncritically to satisfy the demands of dissatisfied consumers .
what follows from this : concentrate on discovering , funding , delivering and explaining to people programmes that work -lrb- whether in terms of prison education , or reassurance policing , or better detection - polly toynbee was right about this -lrb- guardian , 9 june -rrb- , while , at the same time , seeking to reduce the political and media heat that has come to surround crime and punishment .
this has become , under your government , an area of legislative hyperactivity -lrb- with in excess of 40 acts of parliament passed in this field since 1997 -rrb- , and endless proclamations of intent .
as an observer , i confess this has left me somewhat baffled - activity that seems to have more to do with the imperatives of electoral competition than a serious effort to address problems of crime and disorder .
it may even be - as the home office has found to its cost in recent weeks - that the dizzying pace of new initiatives has made it more difficult to keep one 's eye on the ball of sound administration and delivering programmes that stand some chance of achieving positive results on the ground .

with every passing day , what viewers watch is being decided less by editors and more by algorithms which place one thing or another at the top of the pile the estimable emily bell of the guardian is always at it , complaining recently about the bbc 's digital plans and asking " is it really necessary , useful or at all enhancing to have a newsnight podcast ? "
the viewers , of course , have answered resoundingly by propelling our weekly offering to number three in the news podcast chart .
no sex please , we 're news and this is where my own bit of lobbying comes in .
we would , pace emily , love to be number one .
but while the current way of classifying news podcasts persists , that would appear to be beyond us .
newsnight 's podcast rival - is that gun enough to warn off paxman ?
i 've no complaints about number two .

but what is number one ?
sky 's excellent offering , including - and jeremy would approve of this - pictures ?

no , it 's something called kitcast .
kitcast is , according to the blurb , " a ten minute weekly videoblog covering the world of sex " .
each episode , it goes on , is " hosted by a lingerie clad -lrb- non-nude -rrb- hostess ms kitka " - a little red box warns of explicit content .
does that matter ?
well , consider two developments in the digital revolution this week .
first , that traditional showcase of musical popularity top of the pops was summarily swept away .

after a hard night shouting at the television screen , mr dickens writes to peter barron eric - who makes an improbable and possibly not pressingly busy living as a translator from estonian - has been writing to the programme for years , pointing out its inadequacies and praising its strong points , always with wit and sometimes with savagery .
of late , he 's been complaining about what he sees as the modernising tendency on newsnight , so in a stroke of modernism we decided to give him his own column on the website .
a little oddly , though , since he 's gone on public display he 's become a whole lot more polite .
rogue apostrophes also complaining in print this week was the telegraph 's arts correspondent rupert christiansen .
harold pinter talks to kirsty wark on review this week in an article railing against the bbc 's arts coverage , he did n't savage newsnight review , but he did wonder - rather loftily - " could n't newsnight 's friday arts review be expanded into something more like bernard pivot 's famous french television programme apostrophes ?

in another move , the local authority also decided to scrap its committees in favour of a single executive .
the two councils said the joint working plan could immediately save £ 4m and allow them to remain individual .

about 50 managerial jobs could be lost in the move and compulsory redundancies have not been ruled out .
stirling council officials will now consult with staff and trade unions to develop detailed proposals within three months .

the new executive , comprising six councillors , will play a major role in leading the authority , including developing new policies and recommending budgets and council tax levels .

the executive will involve three statutory religious representatives and an opposition member on education matters .
stirling council leader corrie mcchord said the new system would allow quicker decision making .
" this administration is showing that we are committed to reviewing and improving our political management arrangements , " he said .
