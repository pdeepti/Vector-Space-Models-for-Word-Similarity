" we expect this stated intention to be followed by concrete deeds , and we are thus waiting for concrete decisions . " dutch foreign minister bernard bot told reuters in ankara turkey needed to send a " political signal " to the eu that it was doing all it can to push through reforms , including plans to ease property rights for religious minorities .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should workers be able to opt for more hours ? eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla lamented the continuing deadlock , saying : " what we have done today does not represent social progress and to my thinking our duty is to bring about progress . "
germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

it was the latest salvo in a not always side-splitting battle of comedy between the two neighbors . how to help germans feel better about themselves ?
the polish tabloid super express on monday proposed changing the rules of soccer so that matches can only end after germany scores a goal , instituting potato salad as a type of dessert and issuing free pictures of polish-born porn actress teresa orlowski to help germans combat the problem of declining birth rates .
poles have been the butt of the joke in a number of german publications .
last week , the online version of german daily die welt published a similar series of suggestions as to how germany could improve its relations with its neighbor .
they included supporting poland 's territorial claims to the north and south poles , requiring germans to leave newly purchased automobiles unlocked to ease the work of polish car thieves and forcing writer günter grass to return politician lech walesa 's moustache .
polish deputy foreign minister pawel kowal defended the super express article , saying poles had the right to react satirically to " ridicule . "
jokes featuring the stereotype of poles as thieves are popular in germany , while polish humor often plays on ideas of germans being humorless and emotionally frigid .
vegetable obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this innocent legume has been at the center of german-polish bickering super express also proposed creating a contest to determine which sort of vegetable german chancellor angela merkel most resembles - a tit-for-tat response to an article this june in the left-wing german daily taz , entitled " the new polish potato , " which attacked polish president lech kaczynski as a half-pint dictator .
kaczynski demanded an apology , and there were rumors he was so incensed that he cancelled a meeting with merkel because of the insult .
kaczynski denied that that was the case .
the german press dubbed the diplomatic row resulting from the taz article the " potato war , " and members of the foreign media noted with bemusement that german and polish humor seemed to be obsessed with vegetables .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a tumultuous trial , saddam hussein was sentenced to death dw readers this week voiced their opinions on the court ruling that saddam hussein is to be executed by hanging , with most respondents voicing their disapproval of the death penalty . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . it is appalling to see on television the joy of those saying the sentence is proof of the fairness and independence of the iraqi judiciary system .
it is all set up and directed from washington through the green zone .
how many crimes against their own peoples have european countries committed in their history to achieve unity , parliamentary , democracy ?
how many crimes have been committed during colonialism ?
how many innocents have died to pay for european and american prosperity ?
cynicism has not been a casualty , for sure . - sergio , costa rica i agree with the human rights group that the trial was flawed and an act of revenge by his former allies .
i hope for peace in iraq that saddam hussein 's life will be spared .
he may be the only leader to stop all the violence in the near future . - g. gosau , canada has saddam been given a fair and just trial ?
-lrb- if -rrb- it is not the case , those who submit him to a death sentence are not any better than him .
anyone who really desires peace will not choose this path . - susylia i think life in prison without parole would be more justified because he still should have many years to live .
knowing he will never get out is a harsh sentence .
the only problem is that european and middle eastern prisons do not have such a sentence , and the united states does not want him . - cecil means it could not have happened to a more deserving butcher . - m. nice compilied by dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : hanging will bring more bloodshed the german and european press were divided on how to view the death sentence for saddam hussein .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.11.2006 german population plunge expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children could become a rare sight in germany germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday . the german population will fall to between 69 and 74 million people in the next four decades , according to a study by the federal statistics office .
that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .

that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings . " the immigration factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wo n't make up for the drop in population the statistics office 's projections are based on an annual influx of migrants of between 100,000 and 200,000 people .
many of them are expected to be muslims .
a small group of policymakers and scientists have been warning that by 2050 germany might become a muslim-dominated country .
but radermacher apparently thought little of ideologically-tinted theories . " even those people who are immigrants adopt after a couple years the lifestyle and the number of children per family .
so the assumption that immigrants will stick to their habits is simply not true , " radermacher said . hardy graupner -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares strategy to tackle demographic change the european union commission on thursday agreed on a strategy paper to address demographic change in the 25-member bloc , including support for balancing the demands of both family and career .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- no brakes on germany 's population freefall a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 07.11.2006 eu fails to break deadlock over working time rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most eu workers are protected against long work hours eu labor ministers have failed to strike a deal on working-hours legislation and break two years of deadlock that has deeply divided member states . the european union 's finnish presidency said on tuesday it was abandoning efforts to reach a deal after a set of carefully calibrated proposals was not enough to bridge differences between member states . " we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 07.11.2006 germans and poles trade insults in " potato war " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish tabloid fired off a round of satire aimed at berlin a polish newspaper has published a list of satiric suggestions on about how to make germans happy .
it was the latest salvo in a not always side-splitting battle of comedy between the two neighbors . how to help germans feel better about themselves ?
the polish tabloid super express on monday proposed changing the rules of soccer so that matches can only end after germany scores a goal , instituting potato salad as a type of dessert and issuing free pictures of polish-born porn actress teresa orlowski to help germans combat the problem of declining birth rates .
poles have been the butt of the joke in a number of german publications .
last week , the online version of german daily die welt published a similar series of suggestions as to how germany could improve its relations with its neighbor .
they included supporting poland 's territorial claims to the north and south poles , requiring germans to leave newly purchased automobiles unlocked to ease the work of polish car thieves and forcing writer günter grass to return politician lech walesa 's moustache .
polish deputy foreign minister pawel kowal defended the super express article , saying poles had the right to react satirically to " ridicule . "
jokes featuring the stereotype of poles as thieves are popular in germany , while polish humor often plays on ideas of germans being humorless and emotionally frigid .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should workers be able to opt for more hours ? eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla lamented the continuing deadlock , saying : " what we have done today does not represent social progress and to my thinking our duty is to bring about progress . "
germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.11.2006 german population plunge expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children could become a rare sight in germany germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday . the german population will fall to between 69 and 74 million people in the next four decades , according to a study by the federal statistics office .
that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings . " the immigration factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wo n't make up for the drop in population the statistics office 's projections are based on an annual influx of migrants of between 100,000 and 200,000 people .
many of them are expected to be muslims .
a small group of policymakers and scientists have been warning that by 2050 germany might become a muslim-dominated country .
but radermacher apparently thought little of ideologically-tinted theories . " even those people who are immigrants adopt after a couple years the lifestyle and the number of children per family .
so the assumption that immigrants will stick to their habits is simply not true , " radermacher said . hardy graupner -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu prepares strategy to tackle demographic change the european union commission on thursday agreed on a strategy paper to address demographic change in the 25-member bloc , including support for balancing the demands of both family and career .

"
microsoft corporation , of which gates is the co-founder and chairman , plans to partner with german organizations to offer it training to german workers . with globalization moving high-tech work to countries such as india and china , germany needs to focus on training its workforce more than ever before , gates said during a speech at the audi forum in ingolstadt on monday . " it fitness and the practical knowledge of knowing how to use computers forms the foundations of global competitive ability , " gates said .
" with the it fitness initiative , we want to energize microsoft as well as its partners to extend and contribute in such a way so that their abilities will make german companies more successful in a global economy . " german workers need technology training bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers need better computer skills germany has europe 's largest economy and a technology sector , with big-hitters such as software maker sap , siemens and infineon technologies .
yet there 's a sense that germans have been slow to jump on the it bandwagon .
in germany , 42 percent of the population does n't use the internet .
yet more than half of germans must use it skills in their jobs . unemployment among workers with low skill levels has reached 20.5 percent .
microsoft and its partners want to train four million germans in it , giving them a job skill that will make them more employable .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

it was the latest salvo in a not always side-splitting battle of comedy between the two neighbors . how to help germans feel better about themselves ?
the polish tabloid super express on monday proposed changing the rules of soccer so that matches can only end after germany scores a goal , instituting potato salad as a type of dessert and issuing free pictures of polish-born porn actress teresa orlowski to help germans combat the problem of declining birth rates .
poles have been the butt of the joke in a number of german publications .
last week , the online version of german daily die welt published a similar series of suggestions as to how germany could improve its relations with its neighbor .
they included supporting poland 's territorial claims to the north and south poles , requiring germans to leave newly purchased automobiles unlocked to ease the work of polish car thieves and forcing writer günter grass to return politician lech walesa 's moustache .
polish deputy foreign minister pawel kowal defended the super express article , saying poles had the right to react satirically to " ridicule . "
jokes featuring the stereotype of poles as thieves are popular in germany , while polish humor often plays on ideas of germans being humorless and emotionally frigid .
vegetable obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this innocent legume has been at the center of german-polish bickering super express also proposed creating a contest to determine which sort of vegetable german chancellor angela merkel most resembles - a tit-for-tat response to an article this june in the left-wing german daily taz , entitled " the new polish potato , " which attacked polish president lech kaczynski as a half-pint dictator .
kaczynski demanded an apology , and there were rumors he was so incensed that he cancelled a meeting with merkel because of the insult .
kaczynski denied that that was the case .
the german press dubbed the diplomatic row resulting from the taz article the " potato war , " and members of the foreign media noted with bemusement that german and polish humor seemed to be obsessed with vegetables .
with the article in super express , another legume has been slung . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish , german leaders hope to improve strained relations tensions between germany and poland have n't ceased since jaroslaw kaczynski became prime minister in july .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should workers be able to opt for more hours ? eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla lamented the continuing deadlock , saying : " what we have done today does not represent social progress and to my thinking our duty is to bring about progress . "
germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

" europe will defend itself against unfair trade , " he said , " just as china does all the time , and just as we are allowed to do under wto rules . "
" when i went to -lrb- the southern chinese port of -rrb- shenzhen earlier this year , " mandelson added , " i was struck by the fact that for every four containers leaving china for europe , three were returning empty . "

bo defended his government 's policies , arguing that china 's economy needed a certain amount of protection .
" people who call on china to open up its markets to the outside world , " bo said , " must recall its basic national condition as a developing country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.11.2006 german population plunge expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children could become a rare sight in germany germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday . the german population will fall to between 69 and 74 million people in the next four decades , according to a study by the federal statistics office .
that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings .

that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a tumultuous trial , saddam hussein was sentenced to death dw readers this week voiced their opinions on the court ruling that saddam hussein is to be executed by hanging , with most respondents voicing their disapproval of the death penalty . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . it is appalling to see on television the joy of those saying the sentence is proof of the fairness and independence of the iraqi judiciary system .
it is all set up and directed from washington through the green zone .
how many crimes against their own peoples have european countries committed in their history to achieve unity , parliamentary , democracy ?
how many crimes have been committed during colonialism ?
how many innocents have died to pay for european and american prosperity ?
cynicism has not been a casualty , for sure . - sergio , costa rica i agree with the human rights group that the trial was flawed and an act of revenge by his former allies .
i hope for peace in iraq that saddam hussein 's life will be spared .
he may be the only leader to stop all the violence in the near future . - g. gosau , canada has saddam been given a fair and just trial ?
-lrb- if -rrb- it is not the case , those who submit him to a death sentence are not any better than him .
anyone who really desires peace will not choose this path . - susylia i think life in prison without parole would be more justified because he still should have many years to live .
knowing he will never get out is a harsh sentence .
the only problem is that european and middle eastern prisons do not have such a sentence , and the united states does not want him . - cecil means it could not have happened to a more deserving butcher . - m. nice compilied by dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : hanging will bring more bloodshed the german and european press were divided on how to view the death sentence for saddam hussein .

as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year . turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to craft registered under the flag of the republic of cyprus , a european union member whose greek cypriot government turkey does not recognize , and lagging reforms have recently put a question mark next to turkey 's bid to join the eu . in an interview with german daily süddeutsche zeitung over the weekened , german chancellor angela merkel said turkey 's eu accesssion talks would be in serious trouble if it did not lift trade restrictions on cyprus . however , appearing to contradict merkel , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned against any premature move to break off talks with turkey . " i would strongly urge that in our interests and in the interests of turkey , we should not be overly hasty in our conclusions .
we ought to leave scope ... for a political compromise between turkish interests and the interests of the cypriots , " steinmeier told a conference of the party of european socialists in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier pushed for patience among turkey 's critics " i am sure that by january 1 we will find a solution between the finnish presidency and the german presidency that will be supported by the european commission , and hopefully by an overwhelming majority of the european council , " steinmeier said . germany will take over the rotating six-month presidency of the european union from finland on jan .

i know and i maintain that the ankara protocol will be ratified , " steinmeier added . eu wants concrete actions several members of the european union , including expansion commissioner olli rehn have repeatedly called for turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan to take concrete steps to show ankara remains committed to the accession talks , which began last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan shifted his policy to avoid an outright crisis with the eu the commission is expected to put forth a progress report wednesday criticizing turkey 's slackening pace of reform in turkey , particularly in regards to article 301 , which outlaws " insulting turkishness . " over the weekend erdogan attempted to ease european minds on the controversial issue . " we are studying several options for how we can handle article 301 in harmony with the spirit of the -lrb- eu-oriented -rrb- reforms , " he said . rehn , however , said the commission had yet to see any details of the options erdogan referred to . " the stated intention by prime minister erdogan to bring turkish legislation on freedom of expression into line with european standards is a welcome initative , " rehn said , before adding a more cautious note .

it was the latest salvo in a not always side-splitting battle of comedy between the two neighbors . how to help germans feel better about themselves ?
the polish tabloid super express on monday proposed changing the rules of soccer so that matches can only end after germany scores a goal , instituting potato salad as a type of dessert and issuing free pictures of polish-born porn actress teresa orlowski to help germans combat the problem of declining birth rates .
poles have been the butt of the joke in a number of german publications .
last week , the online version of german daily die welt published a similar series of suggestions as to how germany could improve its relations with its neighbor .
they included supporting poland 's territorial claims to the north and south poles , requiring germans to leave newly purchased automobiles unlocked to ease the work of polish car thieves and forcing writer günter grass to return politician lech walesa 's moustache .
polish deputy foreign minister pawel kowal defended the super express article , saying poles had the right to react satirically to " ridicule . "
jokes featuring the stereotype of poles as thieves are popular in germany , while polish humor often plays on ideas of germans being humorless and emotionally frigid .
vegetable obsession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this innocent legume has been at the center of german-polish bickering super express also proposed creating a contest to determine which sort of vegetable german chancellor angela merkel most resembles - a tit-for-tat response to an article this june in the left-wing german daily taz , entitled " the new polish potato , " which attacked polish president lech kaczynski as a half-pint dictator .
kaczynski demanded an apology , and there were rumors he was so incensed that he cancelled a meeting with merkel because of the insult .
kaczynski denied that that was the case .
the german press dubbed the diplomatic row resulting from the taz article the " potato war , " and members of the foreign media noted with bemusement that german and polish humor seemed to be obsessed with vegetables .

statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings . " the immigration factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wo n't make up for the drop in population the statistics office 's projections are based on an annual influx of migrants of between 100,000 and 200,000 people .
many of them are expected to be muslims .
a small group of policymakers and scientists have been warning that by 2050 germany might become a muslim-dominated country .
but radermacher apparently thought little of ideologically-tinted theories . " even those people who are immigrants adopt after a couple years the lifestyle and the number of children per family .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should workers be able to opt for more hours ? eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla lamented the continuing deadlock , saying : " what we have done today does not represent social progress and to my thinking our duty is to bring about progress . "
germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

" we are studying several options for how we can handle article 301 in harmony with the spirit of the -lrb- eu-oriented -rrb- reforms , " he said . rehn , however , said the commission had yet to see any details of the options erdogan referred to . " the stated intention by prime minister erdogan to bring turkish legislation on freedom of expression into line with european standards is a welcome initative , " rehn said , before adding a more cautious note . " we expect this stated intention to be followed by concrete deeds , and we are thus waiting for concrete decisions . " dutch foreign minister bernard bot told reuters in ankara turkey needed to send a " political signal " to the eu that it was doing all it can to push through reforms , including plans to ease property rights for religious minorities .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .

germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

he told chinese students on tuesday that if beijing does n't allow more free trade , china could face a complaint at the world trade organization . with europe 's trade deficit with china exceeding 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- , peter mandelson had a warning for an audience at beijing 's elite tsinghua university .
" europe will defend itself against unfair trade , " he said , " just as china does all the time , and just as we are allowed to do under wto rules . "
" when i went to -lrb- the southern chinese port of -rrb- shenzhen earlier this year , " mandelson added , " i was struck by the fact that for every four containers leaving china for europe , three were returning empty . "
but he also stressed that the eu had no plans at present to haul beijing in front of the wto .
ball and chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated western products are a booming chinese industry mandelson 's criticism comes after his commission published a policy paper last month that contemplated a formal complaint against china , if beijing failed to lift barriers to european businesses in a number of major industries .
mandelson also called upon beijing to peg the chinese currency , the yuan , to other currencies beside the us dollar and to crack down on rampant copyright infringements .
pirated chinese versions of products like cds and dvds were " a ball and chain on european competitiveness , " mandelson said . developing country or economic giant ?

the two leaders agreed to set up a framework for negotiations on a new trade and investment treaty .
they also said they would begin an " unofficial dialogue " on the steel industry , where the eu wants china to lift protectionist restrictions .
but they declined to specify what that dialogue would cover .
bo defended his government 's policies , arguing that china 's economy needed a certain amount of protection .
" people who call on china to open up its markets to the outside world , " bo said , " must recall its basic national condition as a developing country . "
mandelson rejected those arguments .

he told chinese students on tuesday that if beijing does n't allow more free trade , china could face a complaint at the world trade organization . with europe 's trade deficit with china exceeding 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 billion -rrb- , peter mandelson had a warning for an audience at beijing 's elite tsinghua university .
" europe will defend itself against unfair trade , " he said , " just as china does all the time , and just as we are allowed to do under wto rules . "
" when i went to -lrb- the southern chinese port of -rrb- shenzhen earlier this year , " mandelson added , " i was struck by the fact that for every four containers leaving china for europe , three were returning empty . "
but he also stressed that the eu had no plans at present to haul beijing in front of the wto .
ball and chain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pirated western products are a booming chinese industry mandelson 's criticism comes after his commission published a policy paper last month that contemplated a formal complaint against china , if beijing failed to lift barriers to european businesses in a number of major industries .
mandelson also called upon beijing to peg the chinese currency , the yuan , to other currencies beside the us dollar and to crack down on rampant copyright infringements .
pirated chinese versions of products like cds and dvds were " a ball and chain on european competitiveness , " mandelson said . developing country or economic giant ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson said china is a major economy with major responsibilities mandelson later met with chinese commerce minister bo xilai .
the two leaders agreed to set up a framework for negotiations on a new trade and investment treaty .
they also said they would begin an " unofficial dialogue " on the steel industry , where the eu wants china to lift protectionist restrictions .
but they declined to specify what that dialogue would cover .
bo defended his government 's policies , arguing that china 's economy needed a certain amount of protection .
" people who call on china to open up its markets to the outside world , " bo said , " must recall its basic national condition as a developing country . "
mandelson rejected those arguments .
" china plays in a different league , " he said .
" the expectations are higher . "

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .

many of them are expected to be muslims .
a small group of policymakers and scientists have been warning that by 2050 germany might become a muslim-dominated country .
but radermacher apparently thought little of ideologically-tinted theories . " even those people who are immigrants adopt after a couple years the lifestyle and the number of children per family .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

" we were quite close to reaching a solution , but not sufficiently close unfortunately , " said finnish labor minister tarja filatov , who chaired the talks . eu states have been divided since 2004 over a revised employment law that would specify maximum number of working hours and how companies could negotiate with employees for an opt-out from a limit of 48 hours per week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flexible hours as in the past , differences between member states over opt-outs for individual employees on working a maximum 48 hours per week proved to be the main stumbling bloc .
blocked by minority tuesday 's talks fell apart after cyprus , france , greece , italy and spain insisted that reform of the working time rules should include plans to phase out the opt-out , which is particularly dear to britain . " there was a blocking minority of five countries , they had a sufficient number of votes to prevent a vote being taken , " said finland 's filatov . pressure is building on member states to reach a deal because most of them are in breach of current rules and face the threat of costly legal action .
the european commission estimates that 23 of the eu 's member states are breaking the rules and has threatened to push ahead with infringement proceedings against them if a solution is not found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should workers be able to opt for more hours ? eu employment commissioner vladimir spidla lamented the continuing deadlock , saying : " what we have done today does not represent social progress and to my thinking our duty is to bring about progress . "
germany unwilling because finland has failed to broker a deal , the matter risks remaining unresolved for some time because germany , which takes on the eu 's rotating presidency for six months at the beginning of next year , has said it not will deal with the dossier . that would leave it to portugal to try to find a deal when it takes on the eu 's six-month rotating presidency in july 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de illegal work booms in berlin while berlin 's overall economy may be stuck in low gear , one sector is positively racing : off-the-books work .

that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings . " the immigration factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wo n't make up for the drop in population the statistics office 's projections are based on an annual influx of migrants of between 100,000 and 200,000 people .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

mandelson rejected those arguments .

that would equal approximately 15 percent drop from the current population of 82.4 million . with an average of 1.36 children per woman , germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe and immigration can not make up the shortfall .
not only are germans not having children , but the population is also getting older and living longer .
that would mean a 22 percent drop in the working population , according to the statistics office . fewer workers and more retirees would put the country 's already strained welfare state under even more pressure . eastern germany hardest hit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of germany will continue to age eastern parts of the country stand a fair chance of being hit by partial depopulation , said walter radermacher , the deputy head of the federal statistics office . " the projections tell us the development of demographic trends will be even more dramatic in the eastern part of germany , " radermacher said in an interview with dw-radio .
" this is because of the fertility rates in the eastern part of germany , because of internal migration within the borders of germany and many other demographic factors . " what really worries demographers is a seemingly inevitable trend here towards a growing number of elderly people .
statisticians reckon that by 2050 the group of people past the age of 60 in germany will be twice as high as those under 20 .
boys who are born now will on average reach the biblical age of 83.5 years , with girls making it to 88 .
this will cause a strain on an already overburdened social system which some say will go bankrupt in just a few decades . " i would n't like to use the word ' bankrupt ' because it 's a major challenge for the social insurance systems , that 's for certain , " radermacher said .
but the first thing is to reform the social security systems … we can learn from other countries … in every case , you need someone who has to work and give you some earnings . " the immigration factor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants wo n't make up for the drop in population the statistics office 's projections are based on an annual influx of migrants of between 100,000 and 200,000 people .
many of them are expected to be muslims .
a small group of policymakers and scientists have been warning that by 2050 germany might become a muslim-dominated country .
but radermacher apparently thought little of ideologically-tinted theories . " even those people who are immigrants adopt after a couple years the lifestyle and the number of children per family .
so the assumption that immigrants will stick to their habits is simply not true , " radermacher said . hardy graupner -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu prepares strategy to tackle demographic change the european union commission on thursday agreed on a strategy paper to address demographic change in the 25-member bloc , including support for balancing the demands of both family and career .

the book is a first-person fictional account , without remorse , of the nazi extermination of the jews by a former german ss officer . the prize jury said littell 's debut novel easily triumphed over a field of three other works from french authors with a 7-3 vote . the book is already a sensation in france , where it sits atop the best-seller list with more than 250,000 copies sold . littell , the 39-year-old son of us journalist and spy novel writer robert littell , was not present to receive the honor . his french editor said he remained at his home in barcelona , spain , and transmitted a message saying " he prefers to stay out of the limelight . " littell " is very happy and he accepts this prize with pleasure , " added antoine gallimard , of the gallimard publishing house , stressing that no form of disrespect was intended by his absence . " he has no time for publicity , partly out of shyness , but also because he believes literature is not an entertainment industry .
what is important is the book itself , " gallimard said , adding that another 150,000 copies would now be printed . littell 's life and work born in new york in 1967 to a jewish family of polish origin , littell grew up in france where he lived until the age of 18 , before returning to the united states for his university studies.after graduating , he spent 15 years traveling around the world , much of it working for humanitarian organizations . he spent eight years working for the french charity action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- in some of the most desperate corners of the world , such as bosnia , rwanda , chechnya and afghanistan and decided in january 2001 to stop everything and write instead . his experience in the field only fed into the tale of barbarism and the bureaucracy of horror .
" for me , the essential thing is the question of the torturer , of political murder , of state murder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the story is a first hand account of the experiences of a german ss soldier fully bilingual , he wrote his 900-page book in french , though admitted that he wrote up much of his methodical research figuring out the chronology or for organigrammes in english , which he describes as " faster , more precise . " " les bienveillantes " has already won a prestigious academie francaise prize given to first-time authors writing in french . " it 's certainly linked to my literary tradition which is more french than anglo-saxon , " he has said of his instinct to write in french . it is soon to be translated and published in britain , the united states and other countries after auctions believed to have netted littell more than a million dollars . the story the novel tells the story of an unrepentant nazi ss officer who recounts his extermination of jews in world war ii . " what interested me was to understand what led people to become torturers , " littell has said in one of his rare interviews . franco-german historian peter shoettler called it a " strange , monstrous book " , explicit to the point of " pornography " on the horrors of the holocaust , and jolted by anachronisms and a wooden rendition of wartime german culture . the head of the goncourt jury , edmonde charles-roux , brushed those views aside , enthusiastically endorsing littell 's book after monday 's vote . " you ca n't dismiss such a monument , " he said . a jury member , jorge semprun , said he was " stunned by this amazing book - it 's the literary event of this half-century .

in a settlement with the federal trade commission , the firm also agreed to now seek consent before installing software and to make removing it easier .
us-based zango , the ftc said , installed adware more than 70 million times , causing 6.9 billion pop-up ads .
zango 's ceo said he " deeply regretted " any negative impact .
consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
lydia parnes , ftc zango , previously called 180 solutions , is based in washington and was described by the ftc as one of the world 's largest distributors of adware - programs that , once installed , can bombard people 's computers with adverts .
the ftc alleged the company used third parties to install its adware onto consumer 's computers , hiding the programs in games , screensavers or browser updates being offered for free .
once installed , the programs monitored internet use and offered pop-up ads based on the sites that had previously been visited .
the ftc claimed zango deliberately made it difficult to identify , locate and remove the adware once it was installed .
the result , the ftc added , was that millions of consumers were receiving adverts without knowing why , and were being watched without their knowledge or consent without a means of stopping it .
ill-gotten gains lydia parnes , director of the ftc 's bureau of consumer protection , said : " consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
" if consumers choose to receive pop-up ads , so be it .
but it violates federal law to secretly install software that forces consumers to get pop-ups that disrupt their computer use . "
the company will now have to pay the us government the $ 3m fine , for what the ftc describes as " ill-gotten gains " , and it is barred from installing adware without computer users ' knowledge and prior consent .
in a statement , zango said third-party affiliates were to blame for the problems and stated it had been working in accordance with the ftc 's standards since january 2006 .
keith smith , ceo of zango , said : " early in our business , and as we 've acknowledged , we relied too heavily on our affiliates to enforce our consumer notice and consent policies .
" unfortunately , this allowed deceptive third parties to exploit our system to the detriment of consumers , our advertisers and our publishing partners .
we deeply regret and apologize for the resulting negative impact .
" the ftc 's leadership in providing clarity around best practices is a welcome and significant step forward for zango and our industry .
" we embrace the new standards and will continue to create , abide by and strive for best practices that protect consumers . "

in a settlement with the federal trade commission , the firm also agreed to now seek consent before installing software and to make removing it easier .
us-based zango , the ftc said , installed adware more than 70 million times , causing 6.9 billion pop-up ads .
zango 's ceo said he " deeply regretted " any negative impact .
consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
lydia parnes , ftc zango , previously called 180 solutions , is based in washington and was described by the ftc as one of the world 's largest distributors of adware - programs that , once installed , can bombard people 's computers with adverts .
the ftc alleged the company used third parties to install its adware onto consumer 's computers , hiding the programs in games , screensavers or browser updates being offered for free .
once installed , the programs monitored internet use and offered pop-up ads based on the sites that had previously been visited .
the ftc claimed zango deliberately made it difficult to identify , locate and remove the adware once it was installed .
the result , the ftc added , was that millions of consumers were receiving adverts without knowing why , and were being watched without their knowledge or consent without a means of stopping it .
ill-gotten gains lydia parnes , director of the ftc 's bureau of consumer protection , said : " consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
" if consumers choose to receive pop-up ads , so be it .
but it violates federal law to secretly install software that forces consumers to get pop-ups that disrupt their computer use . "
the company will now have to pay the us government the $ 3m fine , for what the ftc describes as " ill-gotten gains " , and it is barred from installing adware without computer users ' knowledge and prior consent .
in a statement , zango said third-party affiliates were to blame for the problems and stated it had been working in accordance with the ftc 's standards since january 2006 .
keith smith , ceo of zango , said : " early in our business , and as we 've acknowledged , we relied too heavily on our affiliates to enforce our consumer notice and consent policies .
" unfortunately , this allowed deceptive third parties to exploit our system to the detriment of consumers , our advertisers and our publishing partners .

consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
lydia parnes , ftc zango , previously called 180 solutions , is based in washington and was described by the ftc as one of the world 's largest distributors of adware - programs that , once installed , can bombard people 's computers with adverts .
the ftc alleged the company used third parties to install its adware onto consumer 's computers , hiding the programs in games , screensavers or browser updates being offered for free .
once installed , the programs monitored internet use and offered pop-up ads based on the sites that had previously been visited .
the ftc claimed zango deliberately made it difficult to identify , locate and remove the adware once it was installed .
the result , the ftc added , was that millions of consumers were receiving adverts without knowing why , and were being watched without their knowledge or consent without a means of stopping it .
ill-gotten gains lydia parnes , director of the ftc 's bureau of consumer protection , said : " consumers ' computers belong to them , and they should n't have to accept any content they do n't want .
" if consumers choose to receive pop-up ads , so be it .
but it violates federal law to secretly install software that forces consumers to get pop-ups that disrupt their computer use . "
the company will now have to pay the us government the $ 3m fine , for what the ftc describes as " ill-gotten gains " , and it is barred from installing adware without computer users ' knowledge and prior consent .
in a statement , zango said third-party affiliates were to blame for the problems and stated it had been working in accordance with the ftc 's standards since january 2006 .
keith smith , ceo of zango , said : " early in our business , and as we 've acknowledged , we relied too heavily on our affiliates to enforce our consumer notice and consent policies .
" unfortunately , this allowed deceptive third parties to exploit our system to the detriment of consumers , our advertisers and our publishing partners .
we deeply regret and apologize for the resulting negative impact .
" the ftc 's leadership in providing clarity around best practices is a welcome and significant step forward for zango and our industry .
" we embrace the new standards and will continue to create , abide by and strive for best practices that protect consumers . "

however , nations are likely to stick to fossil fuels , leading to a " dirty , expensive and insecure future " , the iea 's world energy outlook reported .
using renewable power and nuclear energy could help the shift from fossil fuels , the agency said .
the greatest future demand for energy will stem from china and india .
' cost-effective ' the good news is that these -lsb- alternative -rsb- policies are very cost-effective international energy agency executive director , claude mandil the world energy outlook , which looks at energy trends to 2030 , says that the world faces two related energy threats .
one is inadequate and insecure energy supplies at affordable prices , and the other is environmental damage stemming from over-consumption of energy .
" the good news is that these -lsb- alternative -rsb- policies are very cost-effective , " said iea executive director claude mandil .
" there are different upfront costs involved , but they are quickly outweighed by savings in fuel expenditure , " he said .
each extra $ 1 invested in more efficient electrical equipment and appliances avoids more than $ 2 in power generation , transmission and distribution infrastructure , the report says .
the argument that switching to cleaner , more sustainable energy makes economic sense is being increasingly voiced .
the iea report comes on the heels of the stern report , commissioned by the uk government , which argued that extreme weather could shrink the global economy by 20 % .
demand based on the iea 's alternative model , the agency forecasts that energy demand could be cut by 10 % by 2030 - an amount equivalent to china 's current annual output .
one upshot of this scenario would be a 16 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the iea is promoting nuclear energy as part of a ' cleaner ' mix but if nothing is done and energy demand continues , without underlying changes being made , primary energy demand would rise by 53 % between 2006 and 2030 .
the report identifies that underinvestment in new energy supply as a " real risk " .
about half of all investment required is in developing countries , but " it is far from certain that this investment will actually occur " , the report said .
by 2010 , china will be the world 's largest emitter of co2 , overtaking the us , the report predicts .
such an increase would " amplify the magnitude of global climate change " .
other energy as part of the proposed solution , the iea says nuclear power could play a major role in reducing the reliance on imported gas and mitigate the impact of co2 emissions .
" but financing the upfront investment cost may remain a challenge , " stressed mr mandil .
in addition , biofuels could play a significant role in meeting future energy needs for road transport , helping to diversify energy and reduce emissions .

however , nations are likely to stick to fossil fuels , leading to a " dirty , expensive and insecure future " , the iea 's world energy outlook reported .
using renewable power and nuclear energy could help the shift from fossil fuels , the agency said .
the greatest future demand for energy will stem from china and india .
' cost-effective ' the good news is that these -lsb- alternative -rsb- policies are very cost-effective international energy agency executive director , claude mandil the world energy outlook , which looks at energy trends to 2030 , says that the world faces two related energy threats .
one is inadequate and insecure energy supplies at affordable prices , and the other is environmental damage stemming from over-consumption of energy .
" the good news is that these -lsb- alternative -rsb- policies are very cost-effective , " said iea executive director claude mandil .
" there are different upfront costs involved , but they are quickly outweighed by savings in fuel expenditure , " he said .
each extra $ 1 invested in more efficient electrical equipment and appliances avoids more than $ 2 in power generation , transmission and distribution infrastructure , the report says .
the argument that switching to cleaner , more sustainable energy makes economic sense is being increasingly voiced .
the iea report comes on the heels of the stern report , commissioned by the uk government , which argued that extreme weather could shrink the global economy by 20 % .
demand based on the iea 's alternative model , the agency forecasts that energy demand could be cut by 10 % by 2030 - an amount equivalent to china 's current annual output .
one upshot of this scenario would be a 16 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions .
the iea is promoting nuclear energy as part of a ' cleaner ' mix but if nothing is done and energy demand continues , without underlying changes being made , primary energy demand would rise by 53 % between 2006 and 2030 .
the report identifies that underinvestment in new energy supply as a " real risk " .
about half of all investment required is in developing countries , but " it is far from certain that this investment will actually occur " , the report said .
by 2010 , china will be the world 's largest emitter of co2 , overtaking the us , the report predicts .
such an increase would " amplify the magnitude of global climate change " .
other energy as part of the proposed solution , the iea says nuclear power could play a major role in reducing the reliance on imported gas and mitigate the impact of co2 emissions .
" but financing the upfront investment cost may remain a challenge , " stressed mr mandil .
in addition , biofuels could play a significant role in meeting future energy needs for road transport , helping to diversify energy and reduce emissions .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- world risks ' dirty ' energy future bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 10:00 gmt , tuesday , 7 november 2006 world risks ' dirty ' energy future economics of energy mix the world could be dependent on " dirty , insecure and expensive " energy by 2030 , an influential report has warned .
current trends showed that demand for power was set to grow by 53 % by 2030 , the international energy agency said .
but if governments deliver on promises to push cleaner and more efficient supplies , growth in demand could be restrained by about 10 % , it suggests .
greater use of nuclear power could be a " valuable option " to cut imports and curb co2 emissions , the study added .
projected primary energy demands in 2030 the international energy agency 's -lrb- iea -rrb- world energy outlook -lrb- weo -rrb- 2006 also echoed the findings of a recent uk report that said the benefits of cutting emissions outweighed the costs of combatting climate change .
" weo 2006 reveals that the energy future we are facing today , based on projections of current trends , is dirty , insecure and expensive , " said claude mandil , executive director of the iea .
" but it also shows how new government policies can create an alternative energy future which is clean , clever and competitive , " he added .
the document considered two scenarios : business as usual - referred to in the report as the " reference scenario " , this projects how the globe 's energy mix would look in 2030 if current trends were followed alternative policy scenario - projects how the energy mix would appear in 2030 if the package of policies and measures being considered by governments were adopted under the business as usual scenario , the document warned that the demand for fossil fuels , and the related carbon emissions , would continue to grow through to 2030 , if there was no action from the world 's politicians .
overall , the weo says primary energy demand would grow by about 53 % , with fossil fuels accounting for 83 % of the increase between 2004 and 2030 .
but it said that the alternative policy scenario projected that the growth in demand for energy could be cut by 10 % by 2030 - the equivalent to china 's current total energy consumption .
it also said this scenario would deliver 16 % less carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions than the business as usual scenario , the same as the current total emissions from the us and canada combined .
nuclear option the weo champions the role of nuclear power , saying it could make a " major contribution to reducing dependence on imported gas and curbing co2 emissions " .
it forecasts that the total global generation capacity of nuclear power plants could increase from 368 gigawatts in 2005 to 519 gigawatts in 2030 .
the additional nuclear power plants would also have the advantage of being less vulnerable to fuel price changes than coal or gas-fired generation , helping to enhance the security of electricity supplies .
however , it said that governments would have to convince the private sector that the initial investment of about $ 2bn-3.5bn -lrb- £ 1-1.8bn -rrb- per reactor would be a wise move .
ian hore-lacy , director of public communications for the world nuclear association , welcomed the iea 's report .
" given that world energy demand , and more particularly electricity demand , is increasing strongly , we need sources of electricity supply that are safe , affordable , with abundant fuel and are environmental benign , " he said .
" the virtues of nuclear power in all of those respects are becoming widely obvious . "
but greenpeace international called it a " wasted opportunity " .
in a statement , the environmental group said : " while it is important that the iea has finally recognised the need to drastically change the global energy supply in light of climate change , it has offered ' business as usual ' solutions , which are not commensurate with the problems it seeks to solve . "
they said the agency 's nuclear plan would require more than 200 new nuclear reactors in the next 24 years , which was " neither desirable nor realistic " .
biofuels growth the report also projected that biofuels were set to play an increasing role in road transport , providing up to 7 % of the total consumption in 2030 .
biofuels : the next generation to meet this demand , the iea envisaged that the total amount of arable land required would be equivalent to at least the combined size of france and spain .
but the weo warned that the growing demand for food would limit the potential of the plant-derived fuel produced using current technologies .
yet the emergence of new " second generation " technologies , which allow more of a plant 's material to be turned into fuel , could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in either of the projections outlined in the report 's two scenarios , it said .
as for the financial viability of the alternative policy scenario , the iea reached a similar conclusion to the findings outlined in a report by sir nicholas stern , who was commissioned by the uk government to assess the economic impact of climate change .
" the good news is that these policies are very cost effective , " said mr mandil .
" there are additional upfront costs involved , but they are quickly outweighed by savings in fuel expenditure . "
he added that every $ 1 invested in energy efficient appliances and equipment delivered a $ 2 saving on power generation .
the report concluded that a shift to the alternative scenario would " serve all three of the principal goals of energy policy : greater security , more environmental protection and improved economic efficiency " .

current trends showed that demand for power was set to grow by 53 % by 2030 , the international energy agency said .
but if governments deliver on promises to push cleaner and more efficient supplies , growth in demand could be restrained by about 10 % , it suggests .
greater use of nuclear power could be a " valuable option " to cut imports and curb co2 emissions , the study added .
projected primary energy demands in 2030 the international energy agency 's -lrb- iea -rrb- world energy outlook -lrb- weo -rrb- 2006 also echoed the findings of a recent uk report that said the benefits of cutting emissions outweighed the costs of combatting climate change .
" weo 2006 reveals that the energy future we are facing today , based on projections of current trends , is dirty , insecure and expensive , " said claude mandil , executive director of the iea .
" but it also shows how new government policies can create an alternative energy future which is clean , clever and competitive , " he added .
the document considered two scenarios : business as usual - referred to in the report as the " reference scenario " , this projects how the globe 's energy mix would look in 2030 if current trends were followed alternative policy scenario - projects how the energy mix would appear in 2030 if the package of policies and measures being considered by governments were adopted under the business as usual scenario , the document warned that the demand for fossil fuels , and the related carbon emissions , would continue to grow through to 2030 , if there was no action from the world 's politicians .
potential co2 emission savings in detail overall , the weo says primary energy demand would grow by about 53 % , with fossil fuels accounting for 83 % of the increase between 2004 and 2030 .
but it said that the alternative policy scenario projected that the growth in demand for energy could be cut by 10 % by 2030 - the equivalent to china 's current total energy consumption .
it also said this scenario would deliver 16 % less carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions than the business as usual scenario , the same as the current total emissions from the us and canada combined .
nuclear option the weo champions the role of nuclear power , saying it could make a " major contribution to reducing dependence on imported gas and curbing co2 emissions " .
it forecasts that the total global generation capacity of nuclear power plants could increase from 368 gigawatts in 2005 to 519 gigawatts in 2030 .
the additional nuclear power plants would also have the advantage of being less vulnerable to fuel price changes than coal or gas-fired generation , helping to enhance the security of electricity supplies .
however , it said that governments would have to convince the private sector that the initial investment of about $ 2bn-3.5bn -lrb- £ 1-1.8bn -rrb- per reactor would be a wise move .
ian hore-lacy , director of public communications for the world nuclear association , welcomed the iea 's report .
" given that world energy demand , and more particularly electricity demand , is increasing strongly , we need sources of electricity supply that are safe , affordable , with abundant fuel and are environmental benign , " he said .
" the virtues of nuclear power in all of those respects are becoming widely obvious . "
but greenpeace international called it a " wasted opportunity " .
in a statement , the environmental group said : " while it is important that the iea has finally recognised the need to drastically change the global energy supply in light of climate change , it has offered ' business as usual ' solutions , which are not commensurate with the problems it seeks to solve . "
they said the agency 's nuclear plan would require more than 200 new nuclear reactors in the next 24 years , which was " neither desirable nor realistic " .
biofuels growth the report also projected that biofuels were set to play an increasing role in road transport , providing up to 7 % of the total consumption in 2030 .
biofuels : the next generation to meet this demand , the iea envisaged that the total amount of arable land required would be equivalent to at least the combined size of france and spain .
but the weo warned that the growing demand for food would limit the potential of the plant-derived fuel produced using current technologies .
yet the emergence of new " second generation " technologies , which allow more of a plant 's material to be turned into fuel , could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in either of the projections outlined in the report 's two scenarios , it said .
as for the financial viability of the alternative policy scenario , the iea reached a similar conclusion to the findings outlined in a report by sir nicholas stern , who was commissioned by the uk government to assess the economic impact of climate change .
" the good news is that these policies are very cost effective , " said mr mandil .
" there are additional upfront costs involved , but they are quickly outweighed by savings in fuel expenditure . "
he added that every $ 1 invested in energy efficient appliances and equipment delivered a $ 2 saving on power generation .
the report concluded that a shift to the alternative scenario would " serve all three of the principal goals of energy policy : greater security , more environmental protection and improved economic efficiency " .

a fee of £ 4.5m has been set for the sprawling south uist estate which also includes eriskay and part of benbecula .
community leaders said the big lottery fund award was a " huge boost " and they believe that the 93,000-acre estate will be theirs by the end of the month .
if the sale goes ahead it would be the largest community buyout of land in scotland .
' absolutely delighted ' the buyout has been launched by sealladh na beinne moire -lrb- the vision for the islands -rrb- .
the group is made up of 3,500 estate residents .
they feel the area is not being exploited to the benefit of the community and want to boost its economy .
the group is also hopeful of a further £ 2m from highlands and islands enterprise , the board if which meets later this month and they have further pledges from scottish natural heritage and the islands council .
angus macmillan , chairman of sealladh na beinne moire , said they were " absolutely delighted " to have been awarded the lottery funding .
this is about taking community land ownership back to its roots dharmendra kanani big lottery fund " we believe that the community ownership of south uist , benbecula , and eriskay presents us with a unique opportunity to develop appropriately the resources that we have . "
" over the years to come , we will seek to determine the sustainable economic regeneration of these islands , using every means at our disposal . "
dharmendra kanani , scotland director of the big lottery fund , said : " this is about taking community land ownership back to its roots .
" we also want to give communities more power over their lives to help them become stronger , with shared aspirations and the ability to achieve these together . "
south uist has a golf course dating back to 1892 angus macneil , scottish national party mp for the western isles , said sealladh na beinne moire should be applauded for what it had achieved so far .
he said : " this is a feather in the cap for all those who have been working hard behind the scenes over the past couple of years to make this achievable .
" this award is nearly the final piece of the jigsaw that will see the largest community buyout of its kind in scotland . "
in 2005 , a ballot of the community secured a 70 % majority in support of proceeding with the purchase .
as well as 850 crofts , the estate includes fish farming operations , quarries and potentially lucrative shooting , mineral and fishing rights .
south uist is also home to a golf course designed by legendary player old tom morris .
it is proposed to restore the askernish course to its original 1892 layout .

michael is one such carer .
he is just like any other five-year-old - but unlike most of his peers michael gunstone has had to learn to look after himself as well as his mother .
michael is one of around 2,000 young carers supported by barnardo 's - but the charity says many more are going unnoticed and unsupported .
michael , from pontyberem near llanelli , south wales , has never known a time when he was not a carer .
his mother , janine , was diagnosed with a degenerative disease when michael was barely four months old .
she went from being fit and active to being disabled .
' doing more and more ' janine manages alone with some help from her father but michael has had to learn to care for her and to fend for himself in the house .
she said : " i remember one time when michael was about 10 months old and he was crawling along on the floor .
" i was on crutches at the time and i collapsed in a heap on the floor and my crutches went from under me .
michael laughed .
he thought it was a game .
" so i laughed too and said ' mummy 's sticks ' .
he crawled and pulled the crutches over to me .
" as time has gone on , i have seen him do more and more for me . "
he needs time to be a child and not worry about me janine gunstone michael now helps his mother to the toilet and shower .
he can fold and unfold her wheelchair and dismantle it to fit in the boot of a taxi .
" at night he will come into my room sometimes to check to see if i need to go to the toilet , and he will ask me if i have taken my tablets , " said janine .
" as well as looking after me , he has learned to look after himself .
if he falls he knows i can not get to him , so he picks himself up and comes to me .
" it has made him think before he does anything - that has become second nature to him .
" he has learnt to butter bread and make himself a sandwich when he is hungry . "
time to be a child the two have fun together when at home - cuddling up on the sofa reading a book or playing a game .
but janine is aware that michael is always looking out for her .
she finally phoned social services for help after an incident in which she collapsed and knocked her head and then lay unconscious for a while with michael looking after her .
when she came to her son had pulled a blanket over to her and was smiling , saying : " mum , i think you need to phone a friend . "
since then michael has been referred to a barnardo 's young carers ' project .
" he needs time to be a child and not worry about me , " said janine .
" when he is with young carers , he has time to himself when he can be just a child . "

michael is one such carer .
he is just like any other five-year-old - but unlike most of his peers michael gunstone has had to learn to look after himself as well as his mother .
michael is one of around 2,000 young carers supported by barnardo 's - but the charity says many more are going unnoticed and unsupported .
michael , from pontyberem near llanelli , south wales , has never known a time when he was not a carer .
his mother , janine , was diagnosed with a degenerative disease when michael was barely four months old .
she went from being fit and active to being disabled .
' doing more and more ' janine manages alone with some help from her father but michael has had to learn to care for her and to fend for himself in the house .
she said : " i remember one time when michael was about 10 months old and he was crawling along on the floor .
" i was on crutches at the time and i collapsed in a heap on the floor and my crutches went from under me .
michael laughed .
he thought it was a game .
" so i laughed too and said ' mummy 's sticks ' .
he crawled and pulled the crutches over to me .
" as time has gone on , i have seen him do more and more for me . "
he needs time to be a child and not worry about me janine gunstone michael now helps his mother to the toilet and shower .
he can fold and unfold her wheelchair and dismantle it to fit in the boot of a taxi .
" at night he will come into my room sometimes to check to see if i need to go to the toilet , and he will ask me if i have taken my tablets , " said janine .
" as well as looking after me , he has learned to look after himself .
if he falls he knows i can not get to him , so he picks himself up and comes to me .
" it has made him think before he does anything - that has become second nature to him .
" he has learnt to butter bread and make himself a sandwich when he is hungry . "
time to be a child the two have fun together when at home - cuddling up on the sofa reading a book or playing a game .
but janine is aware that michael is always looking out for her .
she finally phoned social services for help after an incident in which she collapsed and knocked her head and then lay unconscious for a while with michael looking after her .
when she came to her son had pulled a blanket over to her and was smiling , saying : " mum , i think you need to phone a friend . "
since then michael has been referred to a barnardo 's young carers ' project .
" he needs time to be a child and not worry about me , " said janine .
" when he is with young carers , he has time to himself when he can be just a child . "

territorial army pte jason smith 's inquest heard " it was only a matter of time " before someone was seriously affected by the suffocating heat .
it was also told that a request had been made for generators to power air conditioning where he was based .
pte smith , 32 , died in iraq on 13 august 2003 .
the inquest continues .
earlier evidence had heard that pte smith died of heat stroke after his body temperature had risen to 41.4c.
' unbearably hot ' sgt ewan stuart told the inquest of the " unbearably hot " conditions in al amarah in iraq 's maysan province .
fellow sergeant , joseph holmes , told the coroner it was a " a hot , dusty hellhole " .
sgt stuart said pte smith had appeared to be suffering no more than any of the others in the company but had visited the medic the day before he died and been told to rest .
the coroner asked sgt stuart whether - given the conditions - it was only a matter of time before something like pte smith 's death happened .
" i would say so sir , yes , " he replied .
the inquest , in oxford , continues .

doctors have injected immature muscle cells from his leg into scarred heart tissue in a bid to repair the damage .
ron jackson , 59 , from rutland , had the operation at leicester 's glenfield hospital .
he will have to wait months to see if the treatment is successful .
the main risk is that the leg muscle tissue could alter the heart 's rhythm , heart specialist tony gershlick said .
the special cells from the muscle were sent to a lab in belgium where they were cultured .
two weeks later they were sent back to leicester to be used in a second operation .
if we could take immature cells and put them in the scarred area they might start to perform and function as heart muscle cells tony gershlick , cardiologist consultant cardiologist tony gershlick said : " we have n't taken the muscle cells from the leg but the immature cells from the outside of the muscle bundle .
" they are ones that undertake repair -lrb- if you suffer a muscle injury -rrb- . "
four other patients are expected to undergo the procedure at glenfield hospital along with several others at london st mary 's .
the research team in leicester said one advantage of this procedure was that the cells were from the patient 's own leg .
other research projects involve using stem cells which can pose ethical questions about their origin .
the cell transfer research is also being done in other european countries including poland , holland , spain , belgium and germany as part of an international trial .
muscle damage the patient 's heart is still beating during the operation as the cells are injected into the damaged area .
ultrasound and x-ray are used to guide a fine tube to the damaged heart muscle .
dr gershlick said the breathlessness experienced by heart attack patients can be treated by drugs and pacemakers but in some cases this is not enough to solve the problem .
" for some time there has been a concept that if we could take immature cells and put them in the scarred area they might start to perform and function as heart muscle cells , " he said .
" we hope these cells - which wo n't necessarily grow into heart muscle tissue - will act as if they are heart muscle tissue . "
mr jackson said : " a heart attack can damage the muscle , so if this is going to make it grow back then that is great news . "
his wife margaret said : " it is something a lot of people could n't do but ron seems to have something within him . "

the hall for cornwall in truro has made a loss of £ 95,000 and claims it may have to raise ticket prices or shut its doors if extra funding is not found .
despite a rise in the number of ticket sales , managers claim the end of objective one funding and rising maintenance costs are to blame .
the venue , which opened in 1997 , attracts about 180,000 theatre and concert-goers a year .
the hall is used for a wide variety of shows , from opera to rock concerts and pantomime to amateur dramatic performances . "
i would like to think people would n't mind giving us a few extra pence " tim brinkman , director over the past few years , audiences have risen by more than 40 % and it has managed to attract bands such as coldplay .
but there has been a series of financial problems as only a small part of money from ticket sales , on average about 20p in every £ 1 , goes to the hall .
most of it goes to the teams and companies producing the shows .
in 2000 , a rescue package saved it from closure , and in 2005 it introduced a 50p levy on all ticket sales to raise money .
hall for cornwall 's annual review reflects on a rollercoaster year for the cornish venue .
in a review of the venue covering april 2005 to march 2006 , director tim brinkman says the hall 's extra grant funding from arts councils and other groups is considerably lower than similar theatres elsewhere in the country .
mr brinkman added that objective one european funding came to an end this year , and ticket sales alone could not fill the gap left .
he believes the 50p levy may have to be increased to make up the deficit .
" what we would have to do is make sure that we do it in such a way that it does n't dissuade people from coming , " he said .
" but i would like to think people would n't mind giving us a few extra pence on top of the ticket price that we can use for theatre . "
trustee denis arbon said more grants were also needed from the arts council and local authorities .
he said : " it ca n't rely solely on ticket sales , it has to be a combination of things .
" but we will continue to operate because , by all measures , apart form the fact that we 're under-funded , the whole thing is very successful . "

the hall was opened in 1997 mr brinkman added that objective one european funding came to an end this year , and ticket sales alone could not fill the gap left .
he believes the 50p levy may have to be increased to make up the deficit .
" what we would have to do is make sure that we do it in such a way that it does n't dissuade people from coming , " he said .
" but i would like to think people would n't mind giving us a few extra pence on top of the ticket price that we can use for theatre . "
trustee denis arbon said more grants were also needed from the arts council and local authorities .
he said : " it ca n't rely solely on ticket sales , it has to be a combination of things .
" but we will continue to operate because , by all measures , apart form the fact that we 're under-funded , the whole thing is very successful . "

despite the problems , the firm said it was optimistic about hitting analyst forecasts next year and was seeing good sales growth in emerging markets .

scottish & newcastle -lrb- s & n -rrb- is among a number of firms that are benefiting from increasing demand in asian and east european markets , where many consumers are spending more on drinks and turning from spirits to beers .

rival pubs firm jd wetherspoons said earlier this month that banning smoking in its pubs had actually helped its earnings growth .
it said its english and welsh pubs that banned smoking last year saw a 2 % increase in sales during the 13 weeks to the end of october from a year earlier , when smoking was allowed .
in scotland - where a national ban has already come into force - sales at its 39 pubs were 5.2 % higher than before .

a report for the charity says only 12 % of maths and 8 % of science gcse textbooks in england are available in braille or other accessible formats .
this meant blind and partially sighted pupils were left struggling to catch up with classmates , the charity said .
the department for education said special needs funding had increased .
it also said it gave the rnib a £ 200,000 grant for the production of embossed materials .
it 's a scandal that blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things - books david mann rnib campaigns officer there are more than 20,000 children aged between five and 16 in the uk with sight problems severe enough to warrant special educational support .
most blind and partially sighted children are educated in mainstream schools in line with government policies of inclusion .
but the charity points out that there is no nationally co-ordinated system of producing or providing text books for blind and partially sighted children .
in its report entitled " where 's my book " , the rnib says that blind and partially sighted children were still being denied equal access to key text books .
the charity commissioned loughborough university 's library and information statistics unit to look at the availability of off the shelf accessible key stage 3 and 4 textbooks .
it focused on the core subjects of maths , science , english and welsh , as well as dictionaries and atlases .
it found that some atlases and dictionaries commonly used by 14-16-year-olds are not available in an accessible format at all .
waste of time of the 37 generic maths gcse titles in england the rnib research found that only one was available in large print and one in five braille .
it also found that only one of the three maths texts prescribed in wales and one of the eight prescribed in northern ireland is available in braille , with none at all in large or giant print .
in science none of the 21 titles prescribed by exam boards , or widely used in secondary schools , in england , wales and northern ireland is available in giant or large print .
some 90 % of 120 special needs teachers or support staff in england , wales and northern ireland surveyed by the team said blind and partially sighted children were often receiving their books much later than their sighted peers .
this was often because teachers were forced to spend hours photocopying , enlarging and retyping pages from textbooks to turn into braille or large print and led to pupils falling behind .
the rnib said it was ridiculous that teachers ' valuable time was being spent in this way .
' inefficient system ' rnib campaigns officer david mann said : " it 's a scandal that in today 's digital age of instant information , blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things in school - books .
" teachers are doing everything they can to ensure that children in their charge do n't go without , but they are battling against an inefficient system , which the government must take responsibility for remedying . "
a dfes spokesman said special education needs remained a government priority and pointed to increased spending of £ 1,070 per pupil since 1997-98 and hinted further funding increases could be on the way .
he added : " we have always been clear that inclusion is about the quality of children 's education , and how they are helped to learn , achieve and participate in the life of their school , whether that is a mainstream or a special school .
" and we are encouraging local authorities to develop a range of provision to meet children 's needs . "

a report for the charity says only 12 % of maths and 8 % of science gcse textbooks in england are available in braille or other accessible formats .
this meant blind and partially sighted pupils were left struggling to catch up with classmates , the charity said .
the department for education said special needs funding had increased .
it also said it gave the rnib a £ 200,000 grant for the production of embossed materials .
it 's a scandal that blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things - books david mann rnib campaigns officer there are more than 20,000 children aged between five and 16 in the uk with sight problems severe enough to warrant special educational support .
most blind and partially sighted children are educated in mainstream schools in line with government policies of inclusion .
but the charity points out that there is no nationally co-ordinated system of producing or providing text books for blind and partially sighted children .
in its report entitled " where 's my book " , the rnib says that blind and partially sighted children were still being denied equal access to key text books .
the charity commissioned loughborough university 's library and information statistics unit to look at the availability of off the shelf accessible key stage 3 and 4 textbooks .
it focused on the core subjects of maths , science , english and welsh , as well as dictionaries and atlases .
it found that some atlases and dictionaries commonly used by 14-16-year-olds are not available in an accessible format at all .
waste of time of the 37 generic maths gcse titles in england the rnib research found that only one was available in large print and one in five braille .
it also found that only one of the three maths texts prescribed in wales and one of the eight prescribed in northern ireland is available in braille , with none at all in large or giant print .
in science none of the 21 titles prescribed by exam boards , or widely used in secondary schools , in england , wales and northern ireland is available in giant or large print .
some 90 % of 120 special needs teachers or support staff in england , wales and northern ireland surveyed by the team said blind and partially sighted children were often receiving their books much later than their sighted peers .
this was often because teachers were forced to spend hours photocopying , enlarging and retyping pages from textbooks to turn into braille or large print and led to pupils falling behind .
the rnib said it was ridiculous that teachers ' valuable time was being spent in this way .
' inefficient system ' rnib campaigns officer david mann said : " it 's a scandal that in today 's digital age of instant information , blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things in school - books .
" teachers are doing everything they can to ensure that children in their charge do n't go without , but they are battling against an inefficient system , which the government must take responsibility for remedying . "
a dfes spokesman said special education needs remained a government priority and pointed to increased spending of £ 1,070 per pupil since 1997-98 and hinted further funding increases could be on the way .
he added : " we have always been clear that inclusion is about the quality of children 's education , and how they are helped to learn , achieve and participate in the life of their school , whether that is a mainstream or a special school .

a report for the charity says only 12 % of maths and 8 % of science gcse textbooks in england are available in braille or other accessible formats .
this meant blind and partially sighted pupils were left struggling to catch up with classmates , the charity said .
the department for education said special needs funding had increased .
it also said it gave the rnib a £ 200,000 grant for the production of embossed materials .
it 's a scandal that blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things - books david mann rnib campaigns officer there are more than 20,000 children aged between five and 16 in the uk with sight problems severe enough to warrant special educational support .
most blind and partially sighted children are educated in mainstream schools in line with government policies of inclusion .
but the charity points out that there is no nationally co-ordinated system of producing or providing text books for blind and partially sighted children .
in its report entitled " where 's my book " , the rnib says that blind and partially sighted children were still being denied equal access to key text books .
the charity commissioned loughborough university 's library and information statistics unit to look at the availability of off the shelf accessible key stage 3 and 4 textbooks .
it focused on the core subjects of maths , science , english and welsh , as well as dictionaries and atlases .
it found that some atlases and dictionaries commonly used by 14-16-year-olds are not available in an accessible format at all .
waste of time of the 37 generic maths gcse titles in england the rnib research found that only one was available in large print and one in five braille .
it also found that only one of the three maths texts prescribed in wales and one of the eight prescribed in northern ireland is available in braille , with none at all in large or giant print .
in science none of the 21 titles prescribed by exam boards , or widely used in secondary schools , in england , wales and northern ireland is available in giant or large print .
some 90 % of 120 special needs teachers or support staff in england , wales and northern ireland surveyed by the team said blind and partially sighted children were often receiving their books much later than their sighted peers .
this was often because teachers were forced to spend hours photocopying , enlarging and retyping pages from textbooks to turn into braille or large print and led to pupils falling behind .
the rnib said it was ridiculous that teachers ' valuable time was being spent in this way .
' inefficient system ' rnib campaigns officer david mann said : " it 's a scandal that in today 's digital age of instant information , blind and partially sighted children are going without the most vital of all things in school - books .
" teachers are doing everything they can to ensure that children in their charge do n't go without , but they are battling against an inefficient system , which the government must take responsibility for remedying . "
a dfes spokesman said special education needs remained a government priority and pointed to increased spending of £ 1,070 per pupil since 1997-98 and hinted further funding increases could be on the way .
he added : " we have always been clear that inclusion is about the quality of children 's education , and how they are helped to learn , achieve and participate in the life of their school , whether that is a mainstream or a special school .
" and we are encouraging local authorities to develop a range of provision to meet children 's needs . "
