but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

"
a spokeswoman said the government had appealed to the kremlin to help british police investigating the affair . the 43-year-old former spy died at london 's university college hospital late thursday , three weeks after he fell ill . the head of the social democratic party in the european parliament , martin schulz , called on russia to cooperate with the british investigation .

" the murder of moscow journalist anna politkovskaya and the mysterious death of alexander litvinenko in london do not cast a positive light on the freedom of the press and expression situation in russia , " he added . british need time to reach conclusion opposition politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the neo-market liberal free democratic party , also supported european involvement in investigating the deaths of litvinenko and politkovskaya . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schockenhoff said the british should finish investigating before the council of europe is involved " one can only hope , for the sake of the relationship between european states and russia , that the evil suspicions of the government exerting its influence will not be confirmed in these cases , " she told the berliner zeitung . the coordinator for the german government 's german-russian relations , andreas schockenhoff , was more reserved when it came to involving pan-european organizations in the investigations , adding that british authorities should have an opportunity to look into the matter before the council of europe is involved . " when a crime is committed in great britain against a british citizen , it is a task for the british authorities , " he said .
" we can not place russia under general suspicion . " putin : death will be used as provocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a forensic tent was erected outside the litvinenko 's home speaking at a russia-eu meeting in helsinki friday , russian president vladimir putin , rejecting any accusations of official involvement in litvinenko 's death , offered his condolences to his family . putin said he believed the death could be used as a " provocation , " adding that he hoped the british authorities do n't do anything to whip up a " political scandal . " while russian dissidents and opponents of putin pointed the finger of blame at moscow , some analysts in london said litvinenko could have fallen victim to a " private feud " between wealthy russian exiles in britain . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.11.2006 eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory trawling is under closer scrutiny eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .
but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- cod gets a christmas reprieve in eu fishing quota agreement eu fisheries ministers struck a deal thursday to restrict fishing of cod stocks in the north sea after days of negotiations .
it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.11.2006 eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory trawling is under closer scrutiny eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .
but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

five million euros will go towards resources for people who have been affected by racist crimes or are particularly vulnerable . the government hopes especially to strengthen civil society and democracy in those regions where right-wing extremists and neo-nazis have managed to form flourishing networks and hate crimes are being committed . the intention is not to replace regional and state initiatives such as youth work but to supplement them , said hermann kues , a deputy in the ministry for family .
he added that the government wanted to support those who were already committed to combating extremism . " so many people demonstrate strong personal courage , " he said .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

"
a spokeswoman said the government had appealed to the kremlin to help british police investigating the affair . the 43-year-old former spy died at london 's university college hospital late thursday , three weeks after he fell ill . the head of the social democratic party in the european parliament , martin schulz , called on russia to cooperate with the british investigation .

" the murder of moscow journalist anna politkovskaya and the mysterious death of alexander litvinenko in london do not cast a positive light on the freedom of the press and expression situation in russia , " he added . british need time to reach conclusion opposition politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the neo-market liberal free democratic party , also supported european involvement in investigating the deaths of litvinenko and politkovskaya . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schockenhoff said the british should finish investigating before the council of europe is involved " one can only hope , for the sake of the relationship between european states and russia , that the evil suspicions of the government exerting its influence will not be confirmed in these cases , " she told the berliner zeitung . the coordinator for the german government 's german-russian relations , andreas schockenhoff , was more reserved when it came to involving pan-european organizations in the investigations , adding that british authorities should have an opportunity to look into the matter before the council of europe is involved . " when a crime is committed in great britain against a british citizen , it is a task for the british authorities , " he said .
" we can not place russia under general suspicion . " putin : death will be used as provocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a forensic tent was erected outside the litvinenko 's home speaking at a russia-eu meeting in helsinki friday , russian president vladimir putin , rejecting any accusations of official involvement in litvinenko 's death , offered his condolences to his family . putin said he believed the death could be used as a " provocation , " adding that he hoped the british authorities do n't do anything to whip up a " political scandal . " while russian dissidents and opponents of putin pointed the finger of blame at moscow , some analysts in london said litvinenko could have fallen victim to a " private feud " between wealthy russian exiles in britain . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .

however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account .

fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.11.2006 eastern european nurses fill germany 's gap in geriatric care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german caregivers often do n't have enough time for the elderly many families do n't have the financial means to put invalid relatives into nursing homes .
in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

"
a spokeswoman said the government had appealed to the kremlin to help british police investigating the affair . the 43-year-old former spy died at london 's university college hospital late thursday , three weeks after he fell ill . the head of the social democratic party in the european parliament , martin schulz , called on russia to cooperate with the british investigation . " president putin is well-advised to assist fully in clearing up this incident , " he told the german mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper . investigation in russia 's interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander litvinenko a thorough investigation would be in the interests of all involved parties , said günter nooke , the german government 's director for human rights . as a member of the council of europe , russia should be particularly interested in keeping " incorrect speculation from circulating , " nooke told the berliner zeitung . " the murder of moscow journalist anna politkovskaya and the mysterious death of alexander litvinenko in london do not cast a positive light on the freedom of the press and expression situation in russia , " he added . british need time to reach conclusion opposition politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the neo-market liberal free democratic party , also supported european involvement in investigating the deaths of litvinenko and politkovskaya . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schockenhoff said the british should finish investigating before the council of europe is involved " one can only hope , for the sake of the relationship between european states and russia , that the evil suspicions of the government exerting its influence will not be confirmed in these cases , " she told the berliner zeitung . the coordinator for the german government 's german-russian relations , andreas schockenhoff , was more reserved when it came to involving pan-european organizations in the investigations , adding that british authorities should have an opportunity to look into the matter before the council of europe is involved . " when a crime is committed in great britain against a british citizen , it is a task for the british authorities , " he said .
" we can not place russia under general suspicion . " putin : death will be used as provocation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a forensic tent was erected outside the litvinenko 's home speaking at a russia-eu meeting in helsinki friday , russian president vladimir putin , rejecting any accusations of official involvement in litvinenko 's death , offered his condolences to his family . putin said he believed the death could be used as a " provocation , " adding that he hoped the british authorities do n't do anything to whip up a " political scandal . " while russian dissidents and opponents of putin pointed the finger of blame at moscow , some analysts in london said litvinenko could have fallen victim to a " private feud " between wealthy russian exiles in britain . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland 's veto a setback for eu-russia talks russian and eu leaders are meeting in helsinki for talks overshadowed by poland 's veto of a partnership pact until russia lifts a ban on meat , and the suspicious death of a former russian spy and outspoken putin critic .

the 190 million euros -lrb- $ 246 million -rrb- invested have not gone to waste . " we can be proud of what we have achieved , " germany 's deputy labor minister , kajo wasserhövel , told reporters this week . however , stephen meister , who campaigns against right-wing extremism in the east german town of wurzen , said it was difficult to assess the success of these government-funded projects . germany 's extreme-right crime rate is growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not welcome in germany clearly , xenophobic extremism in germany has not been eradicated .

five million euros will go towards resources for people who have been affected by racist crimes or are particularly vulnerable . the government hopes especially to strengthen civil society and democracy in those regions where right-wing extremists and neo-nazis have managed to form flourishing networks and hate crimes are being committed . the intention is not to replace regional and state initiatives such as youth work but to supplement them , said hermann kues , a deputy in the ministry for family .
he added that the government wanted to support those who were already committed to combating extremism . " so many people demonstrate strong personal courage , " he said .

government officials announced on tuesday that in 2007 a further 24 million euros would be allocated to initiatives against racism and right-wing extremism .
five million euros will go towards resources for people who have been affected by racist crimes or are particularly vulnerable . the government hopes especially to strengthen civil society and democracy in those regions where right-wing extremists and neo-nazis have managed to form flourishing networks and hate crimes are being committed . the intention is not to replace regional and state initiatives such as youth work but to supplement them , said hermann kues , a deputy in the ministry for family .
he added that the government wanted to support those who were already committed to combating extremism . " so many people demonstrate strong personal courage , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.11.2006 eastern european nurses fill germany 's gap in geriatric care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german caregivers often do n't have enough time for the elderly many families do n't have the financial means to put invalid relatives into nursing homes .
in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .

but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

the 88-year-old producer has over 300 films under his belt .
his latest , " the last train , " just opened . a survivor of the holocaust , over 20 of the producer 's movies have focused on this dark period of germany 's history . brauner was born in lodz , poland on aug .
1 , 1918 .
his father was a jewish wholesaler .
although artur , four siblings and his parents survived the war on the run , many of their friends and relatives perished in nazi concentration camps . berlin cinema company - an international success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last train " has received great reviews in germany for the passionate movie-fan brauner , this medium was appropriate for coming to terms with european history and his own experiences .
in september 1946 , he founded the berlin central cinema company -lrb- ccc -rrb- .
his first film dedicated to the holocaust was " morituri " which told the story of prisoners who had managed to escape . however , germany 's post-war audiences wanted light entertainment in the form of detective stories and german-style wild west adventures .
brauner changed tack and transformed the ccc into one of europe 's most successful studios by churning out box-office hits .
it produced the popular dr. mabuse films and edgar wallace adaptations , as well as movies such as " girls in uniform " and " the passersby " with romy schneider . bearing witness to the past with the money brauner made from ccc 's commercial successes , he was able to finance projects which were closer to his heart . " i think that you need a certain direction in life , " he said .
" i divide my time between making ordinary entertainment films ... and films that are intended for the time when i 'm no longer here .
in maybe 500 or 100 years , they will bear witness to what happened in the past . " in 1975 , he produced alexander ford 's " the martyr , " which told the true story of a warsaw doctor who accompanied children from his orphanage to the treblinka death-camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the white rose christian probst and hans and sophie scholl michael verhoeven 's " the white rose " about the munich resistance group leaders , who were executed by the nazis , was made in 1982 .
a few years later , " europa europa " traced the life of a young jewish boy who survives the war by hiding his roots and eventually joining the hitler youth movement .
although the movie got a poor reception in germany , it was an international hit .
there was much embarrassment when it was nominated for an oscar for best adapted screenplay . from berlin to auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the last train " brauner 's most recent production , " the last train , " opened in germany this month .
it starts in april 1943 when hundreds of berlin jews were rounded up to clear the capital in time for adolf hitler 's birthday . the trains left from the capital 's grunewald station in an elegant residential district where the inhabitants claimed to have noticed nothing .
in the opening sequence , the camera pans round to the " platform 17 " memorial to the deportees erected by deutsche bahn .
the national railway service partly sponsored the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the victims at the memorial at " platform 17 " in berlin the last train is a cattle-train - its destination is auschwitz .
the film depicts the suffering and hopelessness of masses of people locked up in wagons for days and days .
their desperation increases as they struggle with hunger , thirst and their fear of the unknown . " i think about the past day and night and i 'm in constant touch with the past , " brauner said .
" i need to make these victims unforgettable , i want them all to be given faces .
if it achieves the aim that people who have seen the film say ' never again ' and that nothing like this ever happens again , then i 'll have done something right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.11.2006 eu sets rules to save deep water fish stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory trawling is under closer scrutiny eu fisheries ministers agreed on a set of measures to slow overfishing in european waters .
but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- cod gets a christmas reprieve in eu fishing quota agreement eu fisheries ministers struck a deal thursday to restrict fishing of cod stocks in the north sea after days of negotiations .
it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news .
-lrb- 22.12.2005 -rrb- feedback what measures should europe put in place to limit damage to deep sea fish stocks ?

the 88-year-old producer has over 300 films under his belt .
his latest , " the last train , " just opened . a survivor of the holocaust , over 20 of the producer 's movies have focused on this dark period of germany 's history . brauner was born in lodz , poland on aug .
1 , 1918 .
his father was a jewish wholesaler .
although artur , four siblings and his parents survived the war on the run , many of their friends and relatives perished in nazi concentration camps . berlin cinema company - an international success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the last train " has received great reviews in germany for the passionate movie-fan brauner , this medium was appropriate for coming to terms with european history and his own experiences .
in september 1946 , he founded the berlin central cinema company -lrb- ccc -rrb- .
his first film dedicated to the holocaust was " morituri " which told the story of prisoners who had managed to escape . however , germany 's post-war audiences wanted light entertainment in the form of detective stories and german-style wild west adventures .
brauner changed tack and transformed the ccc into one of europe 's most successful studios by churning out box-office hits .
it produced the popular dr. mabuse films and edgar wallace adaptations , as well as movies such as " girls in uniform " and " the passersby " with romy schneider . bearing witness to the past with the money brauner made from ccc 's commercial successes , he was able to finance projects which were closer to his heart . " i think that you need a certain direction in life , " he said .
" i divide my time between making ordinary entertainment films ... and films that are intended for the time when i 'm no longer here .
in maybe 500 or 100 years , they will bear witness to what happened in the past . " in 1975 , he produced alexander ford 's " the martyr , " which told the true story of a warsaw doctor who accompanied children from his orphanage to the treblinka death-camp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the white rose christian probst and hans and sophie scholl michael verhoeven 's " the white rose " about the munich resistance group leaders , who were executed by the nazis , was made in 1982 .
a few years later , " europa europa " traced the life of a young jewish boy who survives the war by hiding his roots and eventually joining the hitler youth movement .
although the movie got a poor reception in germany , it was an international hit .
there was much embarrassment when it was nominated for an oscar for best adapted screenplay . from berlin to auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the last train " brauner 's most recent production , " the last train , " opened in germany this month .
it starts in april 1943 when hundreds of berlin jews were rounded up to clear the capital in time for adolf hitler 's birthday . the trains left from the capital 's grunewald station in an elegant residential district where the inhabitants claimed to have noticed nothing .
in the opening sequence , the camera pans round to the " platform 17 " memorial to the deportees erected by deutsche bahn .
the national railway service partly sponsored the film . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candles for the victims at the memorial at " platform 17 " in berlin the last train is a cattle-train - its destination is auschwitz .
the film depicts the suffering and hopelessness of masses of people locked up in wagons for days and days .
their desperation increases as they struggle with hunger , thirst and their fear of the unknown . " i think about the past day and night and i 'm in constant touch with the past , " brauner said .
" i need to make these victims unforgettable , i want them all to be given faces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.11.2006 eastern european nurses fill germany 's gap in geriatric care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german caregivers often do n't have enough time for the elderly many families do n't have the financial means to put invalid relatives into nursing homes .
in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .

the 190 million euros -lrb- $ 246 million -rrb- invested have not gone to waste . " we can be proud of what we have achieved , " germany 's deputy labor minister , kajo wasserhövel , told reporters this week . however , stephen meister , who campaigns against right-wing extremism in the east german town of wurzen , said it was difficult to assess the success of these government-funded projects . germany 's extreme-right crime rate is growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not welcome in germany clearly , xenophobic extremism in germany has not been eradicated .
indeed , in some parts of the formerly communist east , it is on the increase and the amount of extreme right-wing crimes has risen . in july , the diary of anne frank , who died at the nazi concentration camp bergen-belsen , was burned by neo-nazis in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt . earlier in november , a jewish memorial was desecrated in the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , also in the east . support for the far-right on the up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- " we can not be proud of the regional situation , " wasserhövel said . the leader of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , guido westerwelle , meanwhile told reuters that political support for the far-right had increased as a result of the current government 's policies . far-right parties now hold seats in the parliaments of three of germany 's previously communist states as well as in bremen in the west . the extreme national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- gained representation this september in mecklenburg-vorpommern , having garnered over seven percent of the votes . boosting civil society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen kamm , an anti-nazi campaigner there has been considerable debate in recent months about which strategies to adopt and how to finance education campaigns to curb these worrying developments .
government officials announced on tuesday that in 2007 a further 24 million euros would be allocated to initiatives against racism and right-wing extremism .
five million euros will go towards resources for people who have been affected by racist crimes or are particularly vulnerable . the government hopes especially to strengthen civil society and democracy in those regions where right-wing extremists and neo-nazis have managed to form flourishing networks and hate crimes are being committed . the intention is not to replace regional and state initiatives such as youth work but to supplement them , said hermann kues , a deputy in the ministry for family .
he added that the government wanted to support those who were already committed to combating extremism . " so many people demonstrate strong personal courage , " he said .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

in germany , illegal geriatric nurses from eastern europe are often the only affordable solution for at-home care . for most people , it 's difficult to decide which steps to take when parents or a spouse are in need of care : nursing home or home-based care ?
for many families , it 's a financial decision , as pensions are often insufficient to pay expensive nursing homes . many families also do n't want to pull their relatives out of familiar surroundings and decide for care at home .
but few families have the job and private freedom to take over the care themselves .
the solution is often illegal help from eastern europe . in germany , there has been a growing number of eastern european caregivers in this sector .
they work 24 hours a day , helping with bathing and getting dressed , as well as taking care of the household . in order to fulfill these tasks around the clock , they often live with the elderly .
eastern european nurses are thus for the most part not anonymous caregivers , but sometimes become new family members for those in need .
it is this interpersonal relationship which makes the difference , said claus fussek , a social worker and leading care expert in germany . " what distinguishes these mostly women , who speak german and are motivated , is that they have time , " fussek said .
this was a factor particularly necessary in caring for people with alzheimer 's disease or dementia . " they have time to help with meals , to give someone a hug , they can accompany someone to the bathroom without time pressure or go for a walk with someone , " fussek said .
" these are all things which many german caregivers would like to do , of course , but do not have the time to do so . " german geriatric nurses are losing their jobs there are reportedly up to 100,000 geriatric caregivers from eastern europe in germany .
there are no official numbers , as it mostly involves illegal employment .
these eastern european women have neither a work permit nor do they make social insurance payments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking is also an important part of caregiving for around-the-clock care , they earn between 800 euros -lrb- $ 1,025 -rrb- and 1,200 euros per month .
it 's good pay for them and an affordable alternative for german families .
home care has meanwhile become unthinkable without eastern europeans , fussek said , adding that the caretaking system would collapse in germany otherwise as there is a lack of affordable alternatives .
that is why the demand for illegal nurses is so high , fussek said . but the providers ' federal association bpa said 24-hour care is only necessary in seldom cases .
according to bpa head bernd tews , the dumping prices of eastern european nurses endanger the job market in the german home care sector . " of course , it is n't just jobs which are in danger , but also various facilities have already shut down or had to fire staff because people are taking advantage of care with these illegal workers , " tews said . germany needs legal and affordable home care since 2005 , it has been possible to hire eastern european caregivers legally , with the support of the central employment agency .
but hardly anyone is taking advantage of the possibility .
over the past one-and-a-half years , only some 3,000 eastern european nurses have been placed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caregivers do a lot more than cleaning legally employed , these women cost around 1,100 euros per month .
but since social insurance contributions must be paid , the nurses are left with just 500 euros .
so illegality remains lucrative for both sides .
in addition , the eastern european caregivers are not officially allowed to work as nurses , but merely as so-called household help . " i do n't know who thought that up , " fussek said .
" i do n't know of any household in which i would hire someone to do 38.5 hours of housework .
that is a concept that is far from the practice .
the problem is too complicated that you could try to solve it with such solutions . " and practical solutions are desperately needed .
two million people in germany are currently dependent on nursing care - and the number keeps increasing .
in the next 15 years , three million people are expected to need care .
in order to meet this demographic trend in germany , legal and affordable alternatives for people in need of care and their family members are necessary . nadine wojcik -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .

indeed , in some parts of the formerly communist east , it is on the increase and the amount of extreme right-wing crimes has risen . in july , the diary of anne frank , who died at the nazi concentration camp bergen-belsen , was burned by neo-nazis in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt . earlier in november , a jewish memorial was desecrated in the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , also in the east . support for the far-right on the up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the far right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- " we can not be proud of the regional situation , " wasserhövel said . the leader of the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , guido westerwelle , meanwhile told reuters that political support for the far-right had increased as a result of the current government 's policies . far-right parties now hold seats in the parliaments of three of germany 's previously communist states as well as in bremen in the west . the extreme national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- gained representation this september in mecklenburg-vorpommern , having garnered over seven percent of the votes . boosting civil society bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen kamm , an anti-nazi campaigner there has been considerable debate in recent months about which strategies to adopt and how to finance education campaigns to curb these worrying developments .
government officials announced on tuesday that in 2007 a further 24 million euros would be allocated to initiatives against racism and right-wing extremism .
five million euros will go towards resources for people who have been affected by racist crimes or are particularly vulnerable . the government hopes especially to strengthen civil society and democracy in those regions where right-wing extremists and neo-nazis have managed to form flourishing networks and hate crimes are being committed . the intention is not to replace regional and state initiatives such as youth work but to supplement them , said hermann kues , a deputy in the ministry for family .
he added that the government wanted to support those who were already committed to combating extremism . " so many people demonstrate strong personal courage , " he said .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- cod gets a christmas reprieve in eu fishing quota agreement eu fisheries ministers struck a deal thursday to restrict fishing of cod stocks in the north sea after days of negotiations .
it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news .

but the planned changes fall far short of demands by ecologists and marine biologists . following tough negotiations , agriculture and fisheries ministers from the european union agreed to reduce catches of fish below a depth of 400 meters -lrb- about 400 yards -rrb- . depending on the type of fish , the catch should be reduced by 10 to 25 percent , according to the terms of a deal struck this week .
but that differs significantly from the demands of marine biologists , who have called for an immediate end to deep-sea fishing of overexploited or fully exploited fish stocks . " in recent years , fishing in deep waters has increased as traditional stocks , such as cod , have declined , " the international council for exploration of the sea said on its web site .
" the stocks of many deep-sea fish are in decline and can only sustain very limited fishing pressure .
in light of these concerns , -lrb- we -rrb- suggest an immediate reduction of fishing pressure on fully exploited or overexploited deep-sea stocks . " spain blocks action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh-caught herring from the coast of germany eu ministers only agreed to stop catching certain fish - for instance , deep-sea sharks - and the decision only applies to fishing in eu waters . in new york the united nations is currently debating a world-wide reduction in ecologically damaging deep-sea factory fishing and trawling .
however , eu member spain is working to block an effective ban . joe borg , eu commissioner for fisheries and maritime affairs , warned that the interests of the fishing industry also have to be taken into account . " the difficulty lies in finding a solution that will take pressure off of fish levels , but wo n't send the fishing companies into financial ruin , " borg said .
" it was n't easy , but i think we found the balance . " " like clear-cutting a forest " after shelf waters became severely over-fished in the early 1990s , many fisheries moved operations out to deep water , environmentalists complain ; they say repeated fishing by factory trawlers destroyed entire ecosystems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life may have become safer for some sharks " it can be compared to clear-cutting an entire forest , " said environmental protection group greenpeace . the eu ministers agreed to better protect threatened fish stocks in the mediterranean starting in 2008 .
fishing nets should have bigger holes , and fishing should not take place in breeding grounds near the coast . but the world wildlife fund has said the eu is merely trying to reintroduce dragnet trawling - which has been forbidden since 2002 - through the back door . using technology participants in the talks agreed that new technology should be used to damp illegal fishing .
all trawlers in the eu should be outfitted with electronic logbooks that would register the exact amounts of fish they catch .
with help from satellites , authorities should be able to keep track of the fish and their spawning grounds , as well as the trawlers ' fishing routes . but environmentalists complain that these measures are too little and too slow .
according to a study in the us magazine science , sea life could be eradicated by 2048 if serious protective measures for the ecosystem , including fishing quotas , are n't taken soon . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans urged to think twice about fish on their plate environmental group wwf has called on european consumers to re-think about the fish they eat , warning that many are likely to be the product of illegal , destructive , or wasteful fishing .
-lrb- 02.10.2006 -rrb- sluggish implementation plagues german environmental policy germany 's grand coalition put the right ideas on paper but has been slow in getting results and too willing to compromise on key issues , according to the country 's environmental groups .
-lrb- 18.08.2006 -rrb- cod gets a christmas reprieve in eu fishing quota agreement eu fisheries ministers struck a deal thursday to restrict fishing of cod stocks in the north sea after days of negotiations .
it may be good for the fish but for the fishing industry , it is more bad news .

dyfed-powys police said seven different people had reported seeing a large cat-like animal in recent weeks in the talybont area , near aberystwyth .
pc pat jalloal of dyfed-powys police in aberystwyth said the pictures of the big cat were inconclusive .
but he said there had been a " huge jump " in reported sightings .
in wales , big cat sightings are investigated by the welsh assembly government , in the form of the wildlife management unit based at aberystwyth . "
images received by the police look very similar to a big cat " pc pat jalloal " from the police 's point of view , we have had a huge jump in reported cases in the past few weeks and we want people in the area to be aware of this , " said pc jalloal .
" images received by the police look very similar to a big cat so we are asking people to stay vigilant . "
pc jalloal also warned people not to hunt and shoot the animal .
in march , a radio producer said his own research into sightings of big cats in the welsh countryside appeared to be backed up by findings from the british big cat society -lrb- bbcs -rrb- .
wales is fourth on the list of big cat " hotspots " in the society 's uk survey .
bbc programme maker aled jones collated more than 100 sightings in north and mid wales over an 18-month period .
the bbcs study said it found sightings increasing across the uk .
almost 60 % of sightings were of black cats , and 32 % sandy-coloured or brown , which the bbcs believes could be pumas .

the physicians of myddfai lived in the area in the 13th century and were renowned for their healing powers .
they spawned a tradition of medicine which continued for centuries and their history became entwined with folklore .
experts believe interest in the physicians may have led to prince charles to buy llwynywormwood .
the prince is negotiating to buy the three-bedroom farmhouse set in almost 200 acres as a base for him and the duchess of cornwall can use when they visit wales .
it is also reported that the royals are considering letting their welsh home to holidaymakers .
the prince was apparently intrigued by the physicians ' story when he opened an exhibition on their work at the national botanic garden of wales , a few miles away at llanarthne .
medieval texts suggest the physicians were cadwgan , gruffudd and einion , sons of rhiwallon feddyg , who were doctors to rhys gryg , the lord of dinefwr in the 13th century . "
the bleeding or cutting was not just a small cut , but cutting into the vein " prof turner according to local legend , the family 's healing powers were inherited from a mysterious lady who emerged from the waters of llyn-y-fan fach lake , but manuscripts understood to contain their teachings still exist .
they include lists of recipes using herbs , animals and minerals , which some claim were unusually detailed and proof welsh medicine was ahead of most of europe at the time .
in 2001 , research into the medicinal properties of native welsh plants using the physicians ' manuscripts as a starting point began at the national botanic garden of wales .
professor terry turner , a retired professor of pharmacy said the prince expressed his interest in the work of the physicians when he came to perform the official opening of the gardens .
prof turner said it had " crossed his mind " the prince 's request for more information on the physicians may have led to his decision to buy the estate of llynywormwood .
the professor added many of the plants used by the physicians were still used for medicinal purposes .
he said the manuscripts showed they had used a " whole range " of approaches in their healing .
those included a cure for fever which involved the patient sitting in a bath of cold water without touching the water with their arms , and a hot plaster on their head .
' cup-full of blood ' still in the bath , the patient would have their arm bled .
" the bleeding or cutting was not just a small cut , but cutting into the vein to get a cup-full of blood , " prof turner explained .
he said the physician of myddfai 's writings also contained aphorisms , or truths , many of which were similar to advice still followed today .
" some of the truths match amazingly well , like do n't eat a heavy meal before you go to bed , and taking exercise is important , " he said .

the physicians of myddfai lived in the area in the 13th century and were renowned for their healing powers .
they spawned a tradition of medicine which continued for centuries and their history became entwined with folklore .
experts believe interest in the physicians may have led to prince charles to buy llwynywormwood .
the prince is negotiating to buy the three-bedroom farmhouse set in almost 200 acres as a base for him and the duchess of cornwall can use when they visit wales .
it is also reported that the royals are considering letting their welsh home to holidaymakers .
the prince was apparently intrigued by the physicians ' story when he opened an exhibition on their work at the national botanic garden of wales , a few miles away at llanarthne .
medieval texts suggest the physicians were cadwgan , gruffudd and einion , sons of rhiwallon feddyg , who were doctors to rhys gryg , the lord of dinefwr in the 13th century .
the bleeding or cutting was not just a small cut , but cutting into the vein prof turner according to local legend , the family 's healing powers were inherited from a mysterious lady who emerged from the waters of llyn-y-fan fach lake , but manuscripts understood to contain their teachings still exist .
they include lists of recipes using herbs , animals and minerals , which some claim were unusually detailed and proof welsh medicine was ahead of most of europe at the time .
in 2001 , research into the medicinal properties of native welsh plants using the physicians ' manuscripts as a starting point began at the national botanic garden of wales .
professor terry turner , a retired professor of pharmacy said the prince expressed his interest in the work of the physicians when he came to perform the official opening of the gardens .
the new royal residence is about a mile from the hamlet of myddfai prof turner said it had " crossed his mind " the prince 's request for more information on the physicians may have led to his decision to buy the estate of llynywormwood .
the professor added many of the plants used by the physicians were still used for medicinal purposes .
he said the manuscripts showed they had used a " whole range " of approaches in their healing .
those included a cure for fever which involved the patient sitting in a bath of cold water without touching the water with their arms , and a hot plaster on their head .
' cup-full of blood ' still in the bath , the patient would have their arm bled .
" the bleeding or cutting was not just a small cut , but cutting into the vein to get a cup-full of blood , " prof turner explained .
he said the physician of myddfai 's writings also contained aphorisms , or truths , many of which were similar to advice still followed today .
" some of the truths match amazingly well , like do n't eat a heavy meal before you go to bed , and taking exercise is important , " he said .
