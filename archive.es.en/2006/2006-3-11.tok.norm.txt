the ibm-built machine will allow physicists , chemists , biologists and medical researchers to do highly complex calculations . the four man-high black boxes separated by narrow aisles are deceptively modest-looking .
but inside , they 're chock full of electronics which allow blue gene , as the ibm-built supercomputer is known , to be compared to the human brain , said the head of jülich research center , thomas lippert . " the computer has 16,384 processors , " lippert said .
" these 16,000 processors have to work in a synchronized fashion to allow the computer 's high performance to be applied to a problem . " the version of blue gene at the jülich research center has managed processing speeds of 46 teraflops , equivalent to 46 trillion operations a second .
that 's a tantalizing proposition for scientists and researchers all over europe who will be able to use the supercomputer to do highly complex calculations . supercomputing is considered to be the key technology of the 21st century , said lippert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lippert of the jülich center with the high speed computer jubl " we need supercomputers to support the huge scientific tasks facing us today with simulations , " he said .
" simulations can really only be done on supercomputers , because normal computers would take years , decades or even centuries to do the kind of calculations that supercomputers can finish in a matter of hours or days . " ibm says possible applications are forecasting the weather or predicting the movements of stock markets . " all projects welcome " peter schäfer of the jülich center , which is situated near the western german cities of aachen and cologne , heads a committee which will decide which projects can use the computer at the center - the biggest facility of its kind in europe . " all projects are welcome to apply , providing they have a peaceful aim , " he told afp . ninety percent of the funding came from the german federal state , with the remaining 10 percent contributed by the state of north rhine-westphalia where jülich is situated . according to the respected www.top500.org website , which provides a ranking of supercomputers , the jülich-based machine beats a machine in barcelona , which was considered to be the most powerful computer in europe . however , the french atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- claims it has the most powerful machine in europe , a 50-teraflop machine built by bull which has recently been installed . the www.top500.org list is to be updated in june . the world 's most powerful computer is a more advanced version of the blue gene , based at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy laboratory in california .

the ibm-built machine will allow physicists , chemists , biologists and medical researchers to do highly complex calculations . the four man-high black boxes separated by narrow aisles are deceptively modest-looking .
but inside , they 're chock full of electronics which allow blue gene , as the ibm-built supercomputer is known , to be compared to the human brain , said the head of jülich research center , thomas lippert . " the computer has 16,384 processors , " lippert said .
" these 16,000 processors have to work in a synchronized fashion to allow the computer 's high performance to be applied to a problem . " the version of blue gene at the jülich research center has managed processing speeds of 46 teraflops , equivalent to 46 trillion operations a second .
that 's a tantalizing proposition for scientists and researchers all over europe who will be able to use the supercomputer to do highly complex calculations . supercomputing is considered to be the key technology of the 21st century , said lippert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lippert of the jülich center with the high speed computer jubl " we need supercomputers to support the huge scientific tasks facing us today with simulations , " he said .
" simulations can really only be done on supercomputers , because normal computers would take years , decades or even centuries to do the kind of calculations that supercomputers can finish in a matter of hours or days . " ibm says possible applications are forecasting the weather or predicting the movements of stock markets . " all projects welcome " peter schäfer of the jülich center , which is situated near the western german cities of aachen and cologne , heads a committee which will decide which projects can use the computer at the center - the biggest facility of its kind in europe . " all projects are welcome to apply , providing they have a peaceful aim , " he told afp . ninety percent of the funding came from the german federal state , with the remaining 10 percent contributed by the state of north rhine-westphalia where jülich is situated . according to the respected www.top500.org website , which provides a ranking of supercomputers , the jülich-based machine beats a machine in barcelona , which was considered to be the most powerful computer in europe . however , the french atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- claims it has the most powerful machine in europe , a 50-teraflop machine built by bull which has recently been installed . the www.top500.org list is to be updated in june . the world 's most powerful computer is a more advanced version of the blue gene , based at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy laboratory in california .

that 's a tantalizing proposition for scientists and researchers all over europe who will be able to use the supercomputer to do highly complex calculations . supercomputing is considered to be the key technology of the 21st century , said lippert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lippert of the jülich center with the high speed computer jubl " we need supercomputers to support the huge scientific tasks facing us today with simulations , " he said .
" simulations can really only be done on supercomputers , because normal computers would take years , decades or even centuries to do the kind of calculations that supercomputers can finish in a matter of hours or days . " ibm says possible applications are forecasting the weather or predicting the movements of stock markets . " all projects welcome " peter schäfer of the jülich center , which is situated near the western german cities of aachen and cologne , heads a committee which will decide which projects can use the computer at the center - the biggest facility of its kind in europe . " all projects are welcome to apply , providing they have a peaceful aim , " he told afp . ninety percent of the funding came from the german federal state , with the remaining 10 percent contributed by the state of north rhine-westphalia where jülich is situated . according to the respected www.top500.org website , which provides a ranking of supercomputers , the jülich-based machine beats a machine in barcelona , which was considered to be the most powerful computer in europe . however , the french atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- claims it has the most powerful machine in europe , a 50-teraflop machine built by bull which has recently been installed . the www.top500.org list is to be updated in june . the world 's most powerful computer is a more advanced version of the blue gene , based at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy laboratory in california .

it is hoped that the cps prosecutors ’ evidence will lead to travel banning orders when the hooligans arrive back on british soil . it will be the first time that members of the cps will work alongside british police in a foreign country . " the cps will work closely with police and german prosecutors to collect good quality evidence to build good quality cases , " nick hawkins , the cps chief for soccer issues , said in a statement .
" we will use evidence collected in germany to make sure any english fans who cause trouble there will receive a football banning order when they return home .

" evidence gathered in germany to be used to ban hooligans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information from germany will lead to arrests back in britain evidence collected by the cps in germany will be sent back to a network of specialist prosecutors in england and wales .
a change in legislation , under the violent crime reduction bill currently before the uk parliament , will allow those specialist prosecutors to use the packages of evidence to apply for banning orders in english courts . the proposals being considered will increase the maximum length of these banning orders from three years to five years and also give prosecutors the facility to appeal any decisions by magistrates to refuse their applications . suspects arriving back in britain will be arrested and put before a cps specialist prosecutor and even if they manage to avoid arrest at entry ports , the police and cps in their home areas will now be able to arrest them and ban them from football after they have returned home , the cps stated on its web site . british courts have already banned more than 3,200 people from traveling overseas to watch england play , and german authorities have agreed to help screen travelers at british ports from may 30 . " the objective is very clearly to radiate a message of zero tolerance of the kind of violence that has brought english football and its fans into disrepute , " british culture secretary tessa jowell told reporters in london this week . police on high alert as organized violence fears heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are on high alert for trouble at the world cup fears of organized violence are growing as the world cup gets nearer .

amsterdam 's anne frank museum has one - and cologne 's nazi documentation center does too . the building that is now the nazi documentation center , in downtown cologne , was meant to be the place of business for jeweler leopold dahmen .
the museum , officially the national-socialist documentation center , gets its second name - el-de haus - from dahmen 's initials , l.d. in 1934 , the nazis seized the building from dahmen , and turned it into the headquarters for the state secret police .
prisoners were forced to build their own torture cells in the basement of the building , while gestapo officers carried out business as usual on the upper floors . cellar interrogations by a twist of fate , the building survived the bombing of cologne - which destroyed some 90 percent of the buildings standing in the city 's downtown .
afterward , the basement torture cells were used as storage rooms for wartime files and paperwork . an exhibit at the el-de haus features martha mense , a communist and resistance fighter during the nazi era who herself was interrogated there .
she spent five months in the el-de haus , and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for " preparation for treason " for printing anti-hitler leaflets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing of cologne flattened most of the city in her chilling words , mense explains how it was at the time : " there were office rooms , where the gestapo men sat .
they had different rooms where interrogations were held , like mine .
the men were interrogated downstairs .
mostly they were brought to the cellar .
we could hear the screams .
they opened the cell doors , so i could really hear those screams .
it was supposed to affect me . " after the war , mense led school groups through the tiny torture cells .
she died in 1998 . award is ' honor and incentive ' since the beginning of the 1980s , the number of visitors and school groups has grown .
they are interested in the center 's wealth of historical information on national socialism , such as eyewitness interviews , a media center and various exhibits . the museum 's director , werner jung , said it is a " special honor and also an incentive " to have garnered the " best in heritage " title .
the european heritage association awards the designation once a year in dubrovnik , to the world 's best museums and cultural heritage projects . the national-socialist documentation center and the buddenbrook museum in lübeck are the only two german museums to have won the prize .
the anne frank house in the netherlands has received it , as have museums in britain , croatia , cyprus , finland , greece and russia . josefa martens -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

many are reluctant to take on new members the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement . eu foreign ministers will be joined by their counterparts from serbia and montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania and croatia for informal talks on progress in preparing the former war-torn region for eu entry . " at the heart of our meeting will be strengthening these countries ' european perspective , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , hosting the talks as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency . " of course we are not talking about rushing things ... but we do n't want either to put our foot on the brake arbitrarily , " she added , saying the eu can not go back on promises because of " enlargement fatigue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2003 eu summit in greece - the mood was better back then the promises in question were made at an eu summit in greece in 2003 , when the then 15-nation bloc was flushed with eager anticipation of the addition of 10 new members , with its single currency project just coming to fruition . big bang headache what a difference three years makes : since the " big bang " expansion in may 2004 eu enthusiasm has gone from bad to worse , hitting rock bottom with a double referendum rejection of a long-hailed eu constitution last year . in the balkans , reforms have gone on nonetheless , and with them eu hopes . croatia is furthest advanced , opening eu entry talks last october ; macedonia was given candidate status in december while macedonia is hoping to conclude an association and stabilization accord with the eu in the coming months . moving somewhat slower , serbia and montenegro and bosnia-hercegovina began talks on association accords , the first step on the eu road , late last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato in macedonia " changing our mind would create a real risk of instability , " said one eu source , warning that the prospect of joining the mainstream was the " glue " which keeps the balkans from collapsing into chaos again . but at least two upcoming events risk reviving tensions : talks on the final status of the un-run serb province of kosovo , and a referendum on independence in montenegro in may . promises vs. reality eu governments are watching closely ; and some , without formally opposing their eu hopes , are increasingly insisting that the bloc ensures a careful balance between its promises and the demands that it makes of the balkans nations . " everything is a question of language , of degrees of enthusiasm , " said the eu source , adding that traditional eu heavyweights france and germany in particular are pushing for a touch on the brakes . " we have to be realistic , restate the european perspective , but also underline certain criteria like the eu 's absorption capacity , " said a french diplomat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the enlargement party , the hangnover has set in " absorption capacity " is a phrase with growing weight in eu capitals since last year 's annus horribilis , which highlighted the gulf between the eu elite 's ambitions and public doubts over the half-century old project . with that skepticism mounting , the conditions set for each eu hopeful are being more closely watched : for belgrade and sarajevo they include in particular the demand to cooperate with un war crimes prosecutors . serbia came under a spotlight last month when hopes surged for the capture of former bosnian serb army leader ratko mladic , who along with his boss radovan karadzic is one of the " biggest fish " evading capture in the balkans . unfortunately for belgrade , the hopes came to nothing and mladic slipped through the net again . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia celebrates eu candidate status the balkan country of macedonia with a fledgling economy and unemployment of more than 30 percent is hoping that becoming a candidate for eu membership will bring more investors .

the ibm-built machine will allow physicists , chemists , biologists and medical researchers to do highly complex calculations . the four man-high black boxes separated by narrow aisles are deceptively modest-looking .
but inside , they 're chock full of electronics which allow blue gene , as the ibm-built supercomputer is known , to be compared to the human brain , said the head of jülich research center , thomas lippert . " the computer has 16,384 processors , " lippert said .
" these 16,000 processors have to work in a synchronized fashion to allow the computer 's high performance to be applied to a problem . " the version of blue gene at the jülich research center has managed processing speeds of 46 teraflops , equivalent to 46 trillion operations a second .
that 's a tantalizing proposition for scientists and researchers all over europe who will be able to use the supercomputer to do highly complex calculations . supercomputing is considered to be the key technology of the 21st century , said lippert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lippert of the jülich center with the high speed computer jubl " we need supercomputers to support the huge scientific tasks facing us today with simulations , " he said .
" simulations can really only be done on supercomputers , because normal computers would take years , decades or even centuries to do the kind of calculations that supercomputers can finish in a matter of hours or days . " ibm says possible applications are forecasting the weather or predicting the movements of stock markets . " all projects welcome " peter schäfer of the jülich center , which is situated near the western german cities of aachen and cologne , heads a committee which will decide which projects can use the computer at the center - the biggest facility of its kind in europe . " all projects are welcome to apply , providing they have a peaceful aim , " he told afp . ninety percent of the funding came from the german federal state , with the remaining 10 percent contributed by the state of north rhine-westphalia where jülich is situated . according to the respected www.top500.org website , which provides a ranking of supercomputers , the jülich-based machine beats a machine in barcelona , which was considered to be the most powerful computer in europe . however , the french atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- claims it has the most powerful machine in europe , a 50-teraflop machine built by bull which has recently been installed . the www.top500.org list is to be updated in june . the world 's most powerful computer is a more advanced version of the blue gene , based at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy laboratory in california .

" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time .

" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" i am enjoying the job and it is possible that i will carry on after the world cup .

it is hoped that the cps prosecutors ’ evidence will lead to travel banning orders when the hooligans arrive back on british soil . it will be the first time that members of the cps will work alongside british police in a foreign country . " the cps will work closely with police and german prosecutors to collect good quality evidence to build good quality cases , " nick hawkins , the cps chief for soccer issues , said in a statement .
" we will use evidence collected in germany to make sure any english fans who cause trouble there will receive a football banning order when they return home . " " this initiative solves the legal complications which prevented action being taken against trouble makers returning from previous tournaments abroad . " evidence gathered in germany to be used to ban hooligans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information from germany will lead to arrests back in britain evidence collected by the cps in germany will be sent back to a network of specialist prosecutors in england and wales .
a change in legislation , under the violent crime reduction bill currently before the uk parliament , will allow those specialist prosecutors to use the packages of evidence to apply for banning orders in english courts . the proposals being considered will increase the maximum length of these banning orders from three years to five years and also give prosecutors the facility to appeal any decisions by magistrates to refuse their applications . suspects arriving back in britain will be arrested and put before a cps specialist prosecutor and even if they manage to avoid arrest at entry ports , the police and cps in their home areas will now be able to arrest them and ban them from football after they have returned home , the cps stated on its web site . british courts have already banned more than 3,200 people from traveling overseas to watch england play , and german authorities have agreed to help screen travelers at british ports from may 30 .

germany 's der spiegel magazine reported in january that about 300,000 polish fans will cross the border for the tournament . polish fans looking to achieve notoriety at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish hooligans want to make a name for themselves polish hooligans are aiming to cause mayhem and achieve a notoriety equal to that of the traditional sources of violence such as england and the netherlands , the report said . " the hooligans want to use the world cup to show that they are just as dangerous as their english , dutch or german counterparts .
we must quite simply expect the worst , " jacek purski from the warsaw-based supporters ' initiative nigdy wiecey -lrb- never again -rrb- told der spiegel . a report in the magazine in december described how polish and german hooligans took part in an organized 100-man mass brawl in a forest near the polish border in east germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swift punishment awaits world cup offenders a german plan to deal with lawbreakers at this summer 's world cup includes high-speed trials , fines and expulsions .

but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .

" i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west . " i 'm proud for everything i did in defending my country and my people , " he told us television network fox news in a phone interview in 2001 from his jail outside the hague while he was awaiting trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn poster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on a wall downtown belgrade " all my decisions are legitimate and legal , based on the constitution of yugoslavia and based on the rights to self-defense . " milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists . " the wily serb matched bluff and cockiness with what one commentator called " a machiavellian flare for shedding identities which are of no more use to him . " born the son of an orthodox priest , he started his career as a faceless communist minion , later fashioned himself into a successful businessman and technocrat , and bullied his way into political prominence as a ruthless champion of the serbian cause . " man of the past " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday that former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic was a " man of the past , " but whose legacy still clouds the balkans .
" the consequences are still with us today .
that was clear today in the talks between eu foreign ministers and representatives of the western balkans , " he said after talks with counterparts from five balkan states hoping for eu entry .
" this death should not prevent us from this .
on the contrary , it should revitalize our efforts to ensure peace and stability in the balkans . "

many are reluctant to take on new members the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement . eu foreign ministers will be joined by their counterparts from serbia and montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania and croatia for informal talks on progress in preparing the former war-torn region for eu entry . " at the heart of our meeting will be strengthening these countries ' european perspective , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , hosting the talks as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency . " of course we are not talking about rushing things ... but we do n't want either to put our foot on the brake arbitrarily , " she added , saying the eu can not go back on promises because of " enlargement fatigue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2003 eu summit in greece - the mood was better back then the promises in question were made at an eu summit in greece in 2003 , when the then 15-nation bloc was flushed with eager anticipation of the addition of 10 new members , with its single currency project just coming to fruition . big bang headache what a difference three years makes : since the " big bang " expansion in may 2004 eu enthusiasm has gone from bad to worse , hitting rock bottom with a double referendum rejection of a long-hailed eu constitution last year . in the balkans , reforms have gone on nonetheless , and with them eu hopes . croatia is furthest advanced , opening eu entry talks last october ; macedonia was given candidate status in december while macedonia is hoping to conclude an association and stabilization accord with the eu in the coming months . moving somewhat slower , serbia and montenegro and bosnia-hercegovina began talks on association accords , the first step on the eu road , late last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato in macedonia " changing our mind would create a real risk of instability , " said one eu source , warning that the prospect of joining the mainstream was the " glue " which keeps the balkans from collapsing into chaos again . but at least two upcoming events risk reviving tensions : talks on the final status of the un-run serb province of kosovo , and a referendum on independence in montenegro in may . promises vs. reality eu governments are watching closely ; and some , without formally opposing their eu hopes , are increasingly insisting that the bloc ensures a careful balance between its promises and the demands that it makes of the balkans nations . " everything is a question of language , of degrees of enthusiasm , " said the eu source , adding that traditional eu heavyweights france and germany in particular are pushing for a touch on the brakes .

amsterdam 's anne frank museum has one - and cologne 's nazi documentation center does too . the building that is now the nazi documentation center , in downtown cologne , was meant to be the place of business for jeweler leopold dahmen .
the museum , officially the national-socialist documentation center , gets its second name - el-de haus - from dahmen 's initials , l.d. in 1934 , the nazis seized the building from dahmen , and turned it into the headquarters for the state secret police .
prisoners were forced to build their own torture cells in the basement of the building , while gestapo officers carried out business as usual on the upper floors . cellar interrogations by a twist of fate , the building survived the bombing of cologne - which destroyed some 90 percent of the buildings standing in the city 's downtown .
afterward , the basement torture cells were used as storage rooms for wartime files and paperwork . an exhibit at the el-de haus features martha mense , a communist and resistance fighter during the nazi era who herself was interrogated there .
she spent five months in the el-de haus , and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for " preparation for treason " for printing anti-hitler leaflets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing of cologne flattened most of the city in her chilling words , mense explains how it was at the time : " there were office rooms , where the gestapo men sat .
they had different rooms where interrogations were held , like mine .
the men were interrogated downstairs .
mostly they were brought to the cellar .
we could hear the screams .
they opened the cell doors , so i could really hear those screams .
it was supposed to affect me . " after the war , mense led school groups through the tiny torture cells .
she died in 1998 . award is ' honor and incentive ' since the beginning of the 1980s , the number of visitors and school groups has grown .
they are interested in the center 's wealth of historical information on national socialism , such as eyewitness interviews , a media center and various exhibits . the museum 's director , werner jung , said it is a " special honor and also an incentive " to have garnered the " best in heritage " title .
the european heritage association awards the designation once a year in dubrovnik , to the world 's best museums and cultural heritage projects . the national-socialist documentation center and the buddenbrook museum in lübeck are the only two german museums to have won the prize .
the anne frank house in the netherlands has received it , as have museums in britain , croatia , cyprus , finland , greece and russia . josefa martens -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to build memorial to gays persecuted by nazis the berlin government has given the go-ahead for a memorial designed by a scandinavian artist-duo in central berlin commemorating thousands of homosexuals persecuted by nazi germany .

" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .

" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .

" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .

the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the continuing struggle against soccer violence soccer heads set up anti-violence task force " nobody comes from england to cause trouble " red card for england fans in stuttgart england fans score a goal for good behavior at world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 11.03.2006 british lawyers to work alongside cops at world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyers will collect evidence on english hooligans in germany for cases back in the uk in the strongest showing yet of cross-border cooperation at the world cup , british prosecutors will travel to germany to collect evidence on hooligans which will be used in trials back in the uk . four " flying prosecutors " from the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- will travel with 48 uniformed and 31 plain-clothed police officers to the tournament and will be on hand to collect evidence on offenders for use in uk courts while the host nation will set up courts that can expel english trouble-makers within 24 hours .
it is hoped that the cps prosecutors ’ evidence will lead to travel banning orders when the hooligans arrive back on british soil . it will be the first time that members of the cps will work alongside british police in a foreign country . " the cps will work closely with police and german prosecutors to collect good quality evidence to build good quality cases , " nick hawkins , the cps chief for soccer issues , said in a statement .
" we will use evidence collected in germany to make sure any english fans who cause trouble there will receive a football banning order when they return home . " " this initiative solves the legal complications which prevented action being taken against trouble makers returning from previous tournaments abroad . " evidence gathered in germany to be used to ban hooligans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information from germany will lead to arrests back in britain evidence collected by the cps in germany will be sent back to a network of specialist prosecutors in england and wales .
a change in legislation , under the violent crime reduction bill currently before the uk parliament , will allow those specialist prosecutors to use the packages of evidence to apply for banning orders in english courts . the proposals being considered will increase the maximum length of these banning orders from three years to five years and also give prosecutors the facility to appeal any decisions by magistrates to refuse their applications . suspects arriving back in britain will be arrested and put before a cps specialist prosecutor and even if they manage to avoid arrest at entry ports , the police and cps in their home areas will now be able to arrest them and ban them from football after they have returned home , the cps stated on its web site . british courts have already banned more than 3,200 people from traveling overseas to watch england play , and german authorities have agreed to help screen travelers at british ports from may 30 . " the objective is very clearly to radiate a message of zero tolerance of the kind of violence that has brought english football and its fans into disrepute , " british culture secretary tessa jowell told reporters in london this week . police on high alert as organized violence fears heighten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are on high alert for trouble at the world cup fears of organized violence are growing as the world cup gets nearer .
according to a report in the times of london this week , police in both germany and the uk are concerned that fans are using text messages to arrange a confrontation at england 's june 10 match against paraguay in frankfurt . at the european championships in holland and belgium in 2000 , 800 people were arrested when supporters fought in charleroi before the england-germany game . german police are also concerned about the threat of violence from supporters of the dutch and polish teams at the world cup .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reported in january that about 300,000 polish fans will cross the border for the tournament . polish fans looking to achieve notoriety at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish hooligans want to make a name for themselves polish hooligans are aiming to cause mayhem and achieve a notoriety equal to that of the traditional sources of violence such as england and the netherlands , the report said . " the hooligans want to use the world cup to show that they are just as dangerous as their english , dutch or german counterparts .
we must quite simply expect the worst , " jacek purski from the warsaw-based supporters ' initiative nigdy wiecey -lrb- never again -rrb- told der spiegel . a report in the magazine in december described how polish and german hooligans took part in an organized 100-man mass brawl in a forest near the polish border in east germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swift punishment awaits world cup offenders a german plan to deal with lawbreakers at this summer 's world cup includes high-speed trials , fines and expulsions .

it is hoped that the cps prosecutors ’ evidence will lead to travel banning orders when the hooligans arrive back on british soil . it will be the first time that members of the cps will work alongside british police in a foreign country . " the cps will work closely with police and german prosecutors to collect good quality evidence to build good quality cases , " nick hawkins , the cps chief for soccer issues , said in a statement .
" we will use evidence collected in germany to make sure any english fans who cause trouble there will receive a football banning order when they return home . " " this initiative solves the legal complications which prevented action being taken against trouble makers returning from previous tournaments abroad . " evidence gathered in germany to be used to ban hooligans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : information from germany will lead to arrests back in britain evidence collected by the cps in germany will be sent back to a network of specialist prosecutors in england and wales .
a change in legislation , under the violent crime reduction bill currently before the uk parliament , will allow those specialist prosecutors to use the packages of evidence to apply for banning orders in english courts . the proposals being considered will increase the maximum length of these banning orders from three years to five years and also give prosecutors the facility to appeal any decisions by magistrates to refuse their applications . suspects arriving back in britain will be arrested and put before a cps specialist prosecutor and even if they manage to avoid arrest at entry ports , the police and cps in their home areas will now be able to arrest them and ban them from football after they have returned home , the cps stated on its web site . british courts have already banned more than 3,200 people from traveling overseas to watch england play , and german authorities have agreed to help screen travelers at british ports from may 30 .

according to a report in the times of london this week , police in both germany and the uk are concerned that fans are using text messages to arrange a confrontation at england 's june 10 match against paraguay in frankfurt . at the european championships in holland and belgium in 2000 , 800 people were arrested when supporters fought in charleroi before the england-germany game . german police are also concerned about the threat of violence from supporters of the dutch and polish teams at the world cup .
germany 's der spiegel magazine reported in january that about 300,000 polish fans will cross the border for the tournament . polish fans looking to achieve notoriety at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish hooligans want to make a name for themselves polish hooligans are aiming to cause mayhem and achieve a notoriety equal to that of the traditional sources of violence such as england and the netherlands , the report said . " the hooligans want to use the world cup to show that they are just as dangerous as their english , dutch or german counterparts .
we must quite simply expect the worst , " jacek purski from the warsaw-based supporters ' initiative nigdy wiecey -lrb- never again -rrb- told der spiegel . a report in the magazine in december described how polish and german hooligans took part in an organized 100-man mass brawl in a forest near the polish border in east germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swift punishment awaits world cup offenders a german plan to deal with lawbreakers at this summer 's world cup includes high-speed trials , fines and expulsions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 11.03.2006 klinsi critics offer grudging support but effe wants the sack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and beckenbauer backed klinsi this week but an old adversary put the boot in germany coach jürgen klinsmann got some much-needed support this week but it was tempered by harsh words from ex-colleague stefan effenberg who called for his head and for former bayern boss ottmar hitzfeld to take over . after it looked conceivable that jürgen klinsmann may be ousted even before a ball was kicked in anger at the world cup in germany this summer , it appears that the under-fire coach has had a stay of execution with prominent detractors now pledging their support , albeit with conditions . german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer , who publicly rebuked klinsmann for heading back to his california home after the 4-1 defeat by italy last week instead of attending a world cup workshop in düsseldorf two days later , has now changed his position . the kaiser , speaking from belgrade this week , now believes germany can win the world cup this summer with klinsmann at the helm .
" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" i am enjoying the job and it is possible that i will carry on after the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.03.2006 former yugoslav president milosevic dies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic never showed any regret for his actions in office former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said . " today , saturday , march 11 , slobodan milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the united nations detention unit in scheveningen , " said a statement by the court in the hague . " the guard immediately alerted the detention unit officer in command and the medical officer .
the latter confirmed that slobodan milosevic was dead , " the court said in a statement . the court launched an inquiry into the death . a full autopsy and a toxicological report have been ordered , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia said . milosevic 's family were informed of his death , it added .
but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .
he was facing separate genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic showed only contempt for the un war crimes tribunal milosevic , who defended himself , never recognized the court 's legitimacy and refused to even to make written submissions . lead to reconciliation ? europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west . " i 'm proud for everything i did in defending my country and my people , " he told us television network fox news in a phone interview in 2001 from his jail outside the hague while he was awaiting trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn poster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on a wall downtown belgrade " all my decisions are legitimate and legal , based on the constitution of yugoslavia and based on the rights to self-defense . " milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists .

" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" i am enjoying the job and it is possible that i will carry on after the world cup .

eventually all were shot and killed on a remote farm and buried in a mass grave . milosevic also faced 22 counts of war crimes related to the same atrocities . bosnia -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- milosevic faced two counts of genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the 1995 serb massacre of more than 7,000 muslim boys and men at srebrenica and the detention of thousands of bosnian muslims and croats in camps in inhumane conditions . he was further charged with 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including persecution , murder and torture . the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide , adopted by the united nations general assembly in december 1948 , defines genocide as " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . " the genocide charge specifically listed " the widespread killing of thousands of bosnian muslims during and after the take-over of territories " , specifically naming the 1995 massacre of srebrenica , the only period in the balkan wars officially ruled to constitute genocide by the un court . milosevic was also cited for the killing of thousands of non-serbs in detention camps , such as the infamous omarska and keraterm camps in northwestern bosnia . the indictment listed more than 9,000 dead and stated that the former president participated in a " joint criminal enterprise " , the purpose of which was the " forcible and permanent removal of the majority of non-serbs " from certain areas in bosnia . in all more than 200,000 people were killed during the bosnian war . kosovo -lrb- 1998-1999 -rrb- milosevic , together with four of his allies in a " joint criminal enterprise " , was accused of having " planned , instigated , ordered , committed or otherwise aided and abetted in a deliberate and widespread or systematic campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians . " there were four charges of crimes against humanity and one of war crimes against milosevic , including deportation , forcible transfer , murder and persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds . in 1998-1999 the yugoslav government cracked down on ethnic albanians living in the serbian province of kosovo .
during the conflict more than 10,000 people lost their lives . the prosecution alleged that milosevic , yugoslav president at the time , was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " and also had superior responsibility for the acts of his subordinates . by june 1999 , approximately 800,000 kosovo albanians , or about a third of the entire kosovo albanian population , had been expelled from kosovo .
the indictment listed 900 known dead , killed in separate incidents or mass killings such as the january 1999 massacre in racak which cost 45 lives . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former yugoslav president milosevic dies former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said .

the ibm-built machine will allow physicists , chemists , biologists and medical researchers to do highly complex calculations . the four man-high black boxes separated by narrow aisles are deceptively modest-looking .
but inside , they 're chock full of electronics which allow blue gene , as the ibm-built supercomputer is known , to be compared to the human brain , said the head of jülich research center , thomas lippert . " the computer has 16,384 processors , " lippert said .
" these 16,000 processors have to work in a synchronized fashion to allow the computer 's high performance to be applied to a problem . " the version of blue gene at the jülich research center has managed processing speeds of 46 teraflops , equivalent to 46 trillion operations a second .
that 's a tantalizing proposition for scientists and researchers all over europe who will be able to use the supercomputer to do highly complex calculations . supercomputing is considered to be the key technology of the 21st century , said lippert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lippert of the jülich center with the high speed computer jubl " we need supercomputers to support the huge scientific tasks facing us today with simulations , " he said .
" simulations can really only be done on supercomputers , because normal computers would take years , decades or even centuries to do the kind of calculations that supercomputers can finish in a matter of hours or days . " ibm says possible applications are forecasting the weather or predicting the movements of stock markets . " all projects welcome " peter schäfer of the jülich center , which is situated near the western german cities of aachen and cologne , heads a committee which will decide which projects can use the computer at the center - the biggest facility of its kind in europe . " all projects are welcome to apply , providing they have a peaceful aim , " he told afp . ninety percent of the funding came from the german federal state , with the remaining 10 percent contributed by the state of north rhine-westphalia where jülich is situated . according to the respected www.top500.org website , which provides a ranking of supercomputers , the jülich-based machine beats a machine in barcelona , which was considered to be the most powerful computer in europe . however , the french atomic energy commission -lrb- cea -rrb- claims it has the most powerful machine in europe , a 50-teraflop machine built by bull which has recently been installed . the www.top500.org list is to be updated in june . the world 's most powerful computer is a more advanced version of the blue gene , based at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , a us department of energy laboratory in california .

the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .

they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" i am enjoying the job and it is possible that i will carry on after the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.03.2006 former yugoslav president milosevic dies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic never showed any regret for his actions in office former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said . " today , saturday , march 11 , slobodan milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the united nations detention unit in scheveningen , " said a statement by the court in the hague . " the guard immediately alerted the detention unit officer in command and the medical officer .
the latter confirmed that slobodan milosevic was dead , " the court said in a statement . the court launched an inquiry into the death . a full autopsy and a toxicological report have been ordered , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia said . milosevic 's family were informed of his death , it added .
but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .
he was facing separate genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic showed only contempt for the un war crimes tribunal milosevic , who defended himself , never recognized the court 's legitimacy and refused to even to make written submissions . lead to reconciliation ? europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west . " i 'm proud for everything i did in defending my country and my people , " he told us television network fox news in a phone interview in 2001 from his jail outside the hague while he was awaiting trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn poster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on a wall downtown belgrade " all my decisions are legitimate and legal , based on the constitution of yugoslavia and based on the rights to self-defense . " milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists . " the wily serb matched bluff and cockiness with what one commentator called " a machiavellian flare for shedding identities which are of no more use to him . " born the son of an orthodox priest , he started his career as a faceless communist minion , later fashioned himself into a successful businessman and technocrat , and bullied his way into political prominence as a ruthless champion of the serbian cause . " man of the past " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday that former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic was a " man of the past , " but whose legacy still clouds the balkans .
" the consequences are still with us today .
that was clear today in the talks between eu foreign ministers and representatives of the western balkans , " he said after talks with counterparts from five balkan states hoping for eu entry .
" this death should not prevent us from this .
on the contrary , it should revitalize our efforts to ensure peace and stability in the balkans . "

eventually all were shot and killed on a remote farm and buried in a mass grave . milosevic also faced 22 counts of war crimes related to the same atrocities . bosnia -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- milosevic faced two counts of genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the 1995 serb massacre of more than 7,000 muslim boys and men at srebrenica and the detention of thousands of bosnian muslims and croats in camps in inhumane conditions . he was further charged with 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including persecution , murder and torture . the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide , adopted by the united nations general assembly in december 1948 , defines genocide as " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . " the genocide charge specifically listed " the widespread killing of thousands of bosnian muslims during and after the take-over of territories " , specifically naming the 1995 massacre of srebrenica , the only period in the balkan wars officially ruled to constitute genocide by the un court . milosevic was also cited for the killing of thousands of non-serbs in detention camps , such as the infamous omarska and keraterm camps in northwestern bosnia . the indictment listed more than 9,000 dead and stated that the former president participated in a " joint criminal enterprise " , the purpose of which was the " forcible and permanent removal of the majority of non-serbs " from certain areas in bosnia . in all more than 200,000 people were killed during the bosnian war . kosovo -lrb- 1998-1999 -rrb- milosevic , together with four of his allies in a " joint criminal enterprise " , was accused of having " planned , instigated , ordered , committed or otherwise aided and abetted in a deliberate and widespread or systematic campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians . " there were four charges of crimes against humanity and one of war crimes against milosevic , including deportation , forcible transfer , murder and persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds . in 1998-1999 the yugoslav government cracked down on ethnic albanians living in the serbian province of kosovo .
during the conflict more than 10,000 people lost their lives . the prosecution alleged that milosevic , yugoslav president at the time , was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " and also had superior responsibility for the acts of his subordinates . by june 1999 , approximately 800,000 kosovo albanians , or about a third of the entire kosovo albanian population , had been expelled from kosovo .
the indictment listed 900 known dead , killed in separate incidents or mass killings such as the january 1999 massacre in racak which cost 45 lives . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former yugoslav president milosevic dies former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said .

" today , saturday , march 11 , slobodan milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the united nations detention unit in scheveningen , " said a statement by the court in the hague . " the guard immediately alerted the detention unit officer in command and the medical officer .
the latter confirmed that slobodan milosevic was dead , " the court said in a statement . the court launched an inquiry into the death . a full autopsy and a toxicological report have been ordered , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia said . milosevic 's family were informed of his death , it added .
but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .
he was facing separate genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic showed only contempt for the un war crimes tribunal milosevic , who defended himself , never recognized the court 's legitimacy and refused to even to make written submissions . lead to reconciliation ? europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west . " i 'm proud for everything i did in defending my country and my people , " he told us television network fox news in a phone interview in 2001 from his jail outside the hague while he was awaiting trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn poster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on a wall downtown belgrade " all my decisions are legitimate and legal , based on the constitution of yugoslavia and based on the rights to self-defense . " milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists . " the wily serb matched bluff and cockiness with what one commentator called " a machiavellian flare for shedding identities which are of no more use to him . " born the son of an orthodox priest , he started his career as a faceless communist minion , later fashioned himself into a successful businessman and technocrat , and bullied his way into political prominence as a ruthless champion of the serbian cause . " man of the past " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday that former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic was a " man of the past , " but whose legacy still clouds the balkans .
" the consequences are still with us today .
that was clear today in the talks between eu foreign ministers and representatives of the western balkans , " he said after talks with counterparts from five balkan states hoping for eu entry .
" this death should not prevent us from this .
on the contrary , it should revitalize our efforts to ensure peace and stability in the balkans . "
" milosevic is and was a man of the past , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de after milosevic , serbia struggles to reform on wednesday , belgrade marks the fifth anniversary of the protests that drove slobodan milosevic from office and ended a decade of violence .

they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .

" today , saturday , march 11 , slobodan milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the united nations detention unit in scheveningen , " said a statement by the court in the hague . " the guard immediately alerted the detention unit officer in command and the medical officer .
the latter confirmed that slobodan milosevic was dead , " the court said in a statement . the court launched an inquiry into the death . a full autopsy and a toxicological report have been ordered , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia said . milosevic 's family were informed of his death , it added .
but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .
he was facing separate genocide charges related to the 1992-95 war in bosnia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic showed only contempt for the un war crimes tribunal milosevic , who defended himself , never recognized the court 's legitimacy and refused to even to make written submissions . lead to reconciliation ? europe reacted with hope that his death might lead to reconciliation in the region . " i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west . " i 'm proud for everything i did in defending my country and my people , " he told us television network fox news in a phone interview in 2001 from his jail outside the hague while he was awaiting trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn poster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic on a wall downtown belgrade " all my decisions are legitimate and legal , based on the constitution of yugoslavia and based on the rights to self-defense . " milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists . " the wily serb matched bluff and cockiness with what one commentator called " a machiavellian flare for shedding identities which are of no more use to him . " born the son of an orthodox priest , he started his career as a faceless communist minion , later fashioned himself into a successful businessman and technocrat , and bullied his way into political prominence as a ruthless champion of the serbian cause . " man of the past " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday that former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic was a " man of the past , " but whose legacy still clouds the balkans .
" the consequences are still with us today .
that was clear today in the talks between eu foreign ministers and representatives of the western balkans , " he said after talks with counterparts from five balkan states hoping for eu entry .
" this death should not prevent us from this .
on the contrary , it should revitalize our efforts to ensure peace and stability in the balkans . "

amsterdam 's anne frank museum has one - and cologne 's nazi documentation center does too . the building that is now the nazi documentation center , in downtown cologne , was meant to be the place of business for jeweler leopold dahmen .
the museum , officially the national-socialist documentation center , gets its second name - el-de haus - from dahmen 's initials , l.d. in 1934 , the nazis seized the building from dahmen , and turned it into the headquarters for the state secret police .
prisoners were forced to build their own torture cells in the basement of the building , while gestapo officers carried out business as usual on the upper floors . cellar interrogations by a twist of fate , the building survived the bombing of cologne - which destroyed some 90 percent of the buildings standing in the city 's downtown .
afterward , the basement torture cells were used as storage rooms for wartime files and paperwork . an exhibit at the el-de haus features martha mense , a communist and resistance fighter during the nazi era who herself was interrogated there .
she spent five months in the el-de haus , and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for " preparation for treason " for printing anti-hitler leaflets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing of cologne flattened most of the city in her chilling words , mense explains how it was at the time : " there were office rooms , where the gestapo men sat .
they had different rooms where interrogations were held , like mine .
the men were interrogated downstairs .
mostly they were brought to the cellar .
we could hear the screams .
they opened the cell doors , so i could really hear those screams .
it was supposed to affect me . " after the war , mense led school groups through the tiny torture cells .
she died in 1998 . award is ' honor and incentive ' since the beginning of the 1980s , the number of visitors and school groups has grown .
they are interested in the center 's wealth of historical information on national socialism , such as eyewitness interviews , a media center and various exhibits . the museum 's director , werner jung , said it is a " special honor and also an incentive " to have garnered the " best in heritage " title .

eventually all were shot and killed on a remote farm and buried in a mass grave . milosevic also faced 22 counts of war crimes related to the same atrocities . bosnia -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- milosevic faced two counts of genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the 1995 serb massacre of more than 7,000 muslim boys and men at srebrenica and the detention of thousands of bosnian muslims and croats in camps in inhumane conditions . he was further charged with 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including persecution , murder and torture . the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide , adopted by the united nations general assembly in december 1948 , defines genocide as " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . " the genocide charge specifically listed " the widespread killing of thousands of bosnian muslims during and after the take-over of territories " , specifically naming the 1995 massacre of srebrenica , the only period in the balkan wars officially ruled to constitute genocide by the un court . milosevic was also cited for the killing of thousands of non-serbs in detention camps , such as the infamous omarska and keraterm camps in northwestern bosnia . the indictment listed more than 9,000 dead and stated that the former president participated in a " joint criminal enterprise " , the purpose of which was the " forcible and permanent removal of the majority of non-serbs " from certain areas in bosnia . in all more than 200,000 people were killed during the bosnian war . kosovo -lrb- 1998-1999 -rrb- milosevic , together with four of his allies in a " joint criminal enterprise " , was accused of having " planned , instigated , ordered , committed or otherwise aided and abetted in a deliberate and widespread or systematic campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians . " there were four charges of crimes against humanity and one of war crimes against milosevic , including deportation , forcible transfer , murder and persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds . in 1998-1999 the yugoslav government cracked down on ethnic albanians living in the serbian province of kosovo .
during the conflict more than 10,000 people lost their lives . the prosecution alleged that milosevic , yugoslav president at the time , was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " and also had superior responsibility for the acts of his subordinates . by june 1999 , approximately 800,000 kosovo albanians , or about a third of the entire kosovo albanian population , had been expelled from kosovo .
the indictment listed 900 known dead , killed in separate incidents or mass killings such as the january 1999 massacre in racak which cost 45 lives . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former yugoslav president milosevic dies former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said .

many are reluctant to take on new members the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement . eu foreign ministers will be joined by their counterparts from serbia and montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania and croatia for informal talks on progress in preparing the former war-torn region for eu entry . " at the heart of our meeting will be strengthening these countries ' european perspective , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , hosting the talks as current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency . " of course we are not talking about rushing things ... but we do n't want either to put our foot on the brake arbitrarily , " she added , saying the eu can not go back on promises because of " enlargement fatigue . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2003 eu summit in greece - the mood was better back then the promises in question were made at an eu summit in greece in 2003 , when the then 15-nation bloc was flushed with eager anticipation of the addition of 10 new members , with its single currency project just coming to fruition . big bang headache what a difference three years makes : since the " big bang " expansion in may 2004 eu enthusiasm has gone from bad to worse , hitting rock bottom with a double referendum rejection of a long-hailed eu constitution last year . in the balkans , reforms have gone on nonetheless , and with them eu hopes . croatia is furthest advanced , opening eu entry talks last october ; macedonia was given candidate status in december while macedonia is hoping to conclude an association and stabilization accord with the eu in the coming months . moving somewhat slower , serbia and montenegro and bosnia-hercegovina began talks on association accords , the first step on the eu road , late last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british nato in macedonia " changing our mind would create a real risk of instability , " said one eu source , warning that the prospect of joining the mainstream was the " glue " which keeps the balkans from collapsing into chaos again . but at least two upcoming events risk reviving tensions : talks on the final status of the un-run serb province of kosovo , and a referendum on independence in montenegro in may . promises vs. reality eu governments are watching closely ; and some , without formally opposing their eu hopes , are increasingly insisting that the bloc ensures a careful balance between its promises and the demands that it makes of the balkans nations . " everything is a question of language , of degrees of enthusiasm , " said the eu source , adding that traditional eu heavyweights france and germany in particular are pushing for a touch on the brakes . " we have to be realistic , restate the european perspective , but also underline certain criteria like the eu 's absorption capacity , " said a french diplomat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the enlargement party , the hangnover has set in " absorption capacity " is a phrase with growing weight in eu capitals since last year 's annus horribilis , which highlighted the gulf between the eu elite 's ambitions and public doubts over the half-century old project . with that skepticism mounting , the conditions set for each eu hopeful are being more closely watched : for belgrade and sarajevo they include in particular the demand to cooperate with un war crimes prosecutors . serbia came under a spotlight last month when hopes surged for the capture of former bosnian serb army leader ratko mladic , who along with his boss radovan karadzic is one of the " biggest fish " evading capture in the balkans . unfortunately for belgrade , the hopes came to nothing and mladic slipped through the net again . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de macedonia celebrates eu candidate status the balkan country of macedonia with a fledgling economy and unemployment of more than 30 percent is hoping that becoming a candidate for eu membership will bring more investors .

" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .

it is hoped that the cps prosecutors ’ evidence will lead to travel banning orders when the hooligans arrive back on british soil . it will be the first time that members of the cps will work alongside british police in a foreign country . " the cps will work closely with police and german prosecutors to collect good quality evidence to build good quality cases , " nick hawkins , the cps chief for soccer issues , said in a statement .

we must quite simply expect the worst , " jacek purski from the warsaw-based supporters ' initiative nigdy wiecey -lrb- never again -rrb- told der spiegel . a report in the magazine in december described how polish and german hooligans took part in an organized 100-man mass brawl in a forest near the polish border in east germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swift punishment awaits world cup offenders a german plan to deal with lawbreakers at this summer 's world cup includes high-speed trials , fines and expulsions .

" today , saturday , march 11 , slobodan milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell at the united nations detention unit in scheveningen , " said a statement by the court in the hague .

but russia 's interfax news agency quoted the brother of milosevic - borislav milosevic - as saying the tribual in the hague " carries full responsibility " for the death . milosevic , 64 , had been on trial before the un court since february 2002 on more than 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1990s balkan wars .

" i hope very much this event , the death of milosevic will help serbia to look definitely to the future , " said european union foreign policy chief javier solana , in salzburg for eu talks with balkans policymakers . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , also at the eu talks , said milosevic 's death made no change politically to the history of the region and in particular for belgrade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister vuk draskovic " that is a pity he did n't face the justice in belgrade , " serbia-montenegro foreign minister vuk draskovic -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters at the talks .
milosevic " ordered a few times assassination attempts against my life , " he added . milosevic defied international sanctions and nato bombs over nearly a decade of strife in the former yugoslavia and was unmoved by the accusations against him . he stoked conflicts that left more than 200,000 people dead , up to three million homeless and the yugoslav economy in ruins . no apologies but the burly firebrand made no apologies for his actions in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , where his drive for a greater serbia " cleansed " of croats and muslims sparked a rash of grisly massacres and finally a showdown with the west .

" milosevic was the first former head of state to appear before an international criminal court and faced life in jail if convicted .
but he portrayed himself as a besieged statesman who struggled to keep the crumbling yugoslav federation intact against separatists and " terrorists . " the wily serb matched bluff and cockiness with what one commentator called " a machiavellian flare for shedding identities which are of no more use to him . " born the son of an orthodox priest , he started his career as a faceless communist minion , later fashioned himself into a successful businessman and technocrat , and bullied his way into political prominence as a ruthless champion of the serbian cause . " man of the past " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday that former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic was a " man of the past , " but whose legacy still clouds the balkans .
" the consequences are still with us today .
that was clear today in the talks between eu foreign ministers and representatives of the western balkans , " he said after talks with counterparts from five balkan states hoping for eu entry .
" this death should not prevent us from this .
on the contrary , it should revitalize our efforts to ensure peace and stability in the balkans . "

eventually all were shot and killed on a remote farm and buried in a mass grave . milosevic also faced 22 counts of war crimes related to the same atrocities . bosnia -lrb- 1992-1995 -rrb- milosevic faced two counts of genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the 1995 serb massacre of more than 7,000 muslim boys and men at srebrenica and the detention of thousands of bosnian muslims and croats in camps in inhumane conditions . he was further charged with 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity including persecution , murder and torture . the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide , adopted by the united nations general assembly in december 1948 , defines genocide as " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . " the genocide charge specifically listed " the widespread killing of thousands of bosnian muslims during and after the take-over of territories " , specifically naming the 1995 massacre of srebrenica , the only period in the balkan wars officially ruled to constitute genocide by the un court . milosevic was also cited for the killing of thousands of non-serbs in detention camps , such as the infamous omarska and keraterm camps in northwestern bosnia . the indictment listed more than 9,000 dead and stated that the former president participated in a " joint criminal enterprise " , the purpose of which was the " forcible and permanent removal of the majority of non-serbs " from certain areas in bosnia . in all more than 200,000 people were killed during the bosnian war . kosovo -lrb- 1998-1999 -rrb- milosevic , together with four of his allies in a " joint criminal enterprise " , was accused of having " planned , instigated , ordered , committed or otherwise aided and abetted in a deliberate and widespread or systematic campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians . " there were four charges of crimes against humanity and one of war crimes against milosevic , including deportation , forcible transfer , murder and persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds . in 1998-1999 the yugoslav government cracked down on ethnic albanians living in the serbian province of kosovo .
during the conflict more than 10,000 people lost their lives . the prosecution alleged that milosevic , yugoslav president at the time , was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " and also had superior responsibility for the acts of his subordinates . by june 1999 , approximately 800,000 kosovo albanians , or about a third of the entire kosovo albanian population , had been expelled from kosovo .
the indictment listed 900 known dead , killed in separate incidents or mass killings such as the january 1999 massacre in racak which cost 45 lives . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former yugoslav president milosevic dies former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , known as the " butcher of the balkans , " was found dead in his cell room bed saturday , the un tribunal judging him for war crimes and genocide said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 11.03.2006 klinsi critics offer grudging support but effe wants the sack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and beckenbauer backed klinsi this week but an old adversary put the boot in germany coach jürgen klinsmann got some much-needed support this week but it was tempered by harsh words from ex-colleague stefan effenberg who called for his head and for former bayern boss ottmar hitzfeld to take over . after it looked conceivable that jürgen klinsmann may be ousted even before a ball was kicked in anger at the world cup in germany this summer , it appears that the under-fire coach has had a stay of execution with prominent detractors now pledging their support , albeit with conditions . german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer , who publicly rebuked klinsmann for heading back to his california home after the 4-1 defeat by italy last week instead of attending a world cup workshop in düsseldorf two days later , has now changed his position . the kaiser , speaking from belgrade this week , now believes germany can win the world cup this summer with klinsmann at the helm .
" there is no question that germany can win the world cup .
they are a young if inexperienced team and their strength lies in the support they need and surely will get from the home crowd , " he told reporters . der kaiser does a u-turn and backs his coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer was left seething by klinsmann 's no-show " i am optimistic that jürgen klinsmann will be able to put together a very good team for the world cup and because of the home advantage , germany can win it , " he added . this was in direct contrast to his statements last week : " at the beginning it worked out very well and klinsmann was able to change a few things but now there 's not much left of all that . " " we are back where we were a few years ago and time is running out . " klinsmann also got some word of support from theo zwanziger , the chief executive of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . dfb chief zwanziger supports stay-away klinsmann " he 's not an easy character but easy characters do n't win the world cup , " zwanziger said of the germany coach .
" we need people who go their own way and do n't change their minds all the time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger wants klinsmann to come home however , the main point of contention at the moment , klinmann 's refusal to relocate from his california home to germany , still obviously rankled with zwanziger who told reporters after a dfb meeting in düsseldorf this week that he believed he could convince klinsmann to come back to live in his native country .
" i am certain that we can convince klinsmann that the people want to have him here , " zwanziger said . while german soccer figures are now publicly backing klinsmann , however grudgingly , there is a danger that the fans have already started to turn against him .
germany play the united states in dortmund on march 22 and there are fears that klinsmann might face a hostile reception after he announced that borussia dortmund players christian wörns and sebastian kehl would play no part in his world cup plans . fan backlash feared ahead of crucial us test game " i can understand how the fans in dortmund feel but they must accept the coach 's decisions , " zwanziger said .
" we must all support the national team .
we must go into this world cup believing that we can win it . " " i am not the coach and it is not my duty to pick the team but it is important that , despite the depressing game in italy , we all support our young players , " he said . one person without a vested interest in smoothing things over for the sake of world cup appearances is former german international stefan effenberg who has come out publicly to say what a lot of fans , and even possibly soccer insiders , believe by urging the dfb to sack manager klinsmann immediately and replace him with former bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld . effenberg would sack klinsi now and install hitzfeld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effe wants a change at the top sooner rather than later " if i was in charge then i would get rid of klinsmann right away and get ottmar hitzfeld in , " effenberg told bild daily .
" i would even suggest doing that before the united states game . " " i know klinsmann and he will not give an inch .
the rest of the world is laughing at us and the others are losing respect , " effenberg said . effenberg , who played with the current german manager in the early 1990 's , believes a change is needed even though the finals begin in just three months time .
not content with calling for klinsmann 's dismissal , effenberg called for his old bayern munich boss hitzfeld to take over the reins . hitzfeld turned down the german job after the euro 2004 finals , as did greece manager otto rehhagel , before klinsmann agreed to succeed rudi völler .
" i do not think he would say no a second time if you asked him , " declared effenberg . hitzfeld , who won four german titles , two german cups and the 2001 champions league crown with bayern , is currently a free agent working as an expert on german television . klinsmann hints at contract extension beyond world cup klinsmann has so far refused to comment on all the speculation surrounding his future saying his future hinges on the world cup .
" no i would not say that my job is on the us game , " klinsmann told kicker magazine .
" i am enjoying the job and it is possible that i will carry on after the world cup .

tom fox 's body was found on thursday in the affluent mansour district , iraqi police said .
there were signs that he had been beaten before being killed .
mr fox was seized last november , along with briton norman kember and canadians james loney and harmeet singh sooden .
a video tape showing the other three men was released on tuesday , but mr fox did not feature on it .
mr fox , 54 , had been working with iraqi human rights organisations for the past two years .
his parent organisation , christian peacemaker teams , said it mourned his loss .
" tom fox ... combined a lightness of spirit , a firm opposition to all oppression and the recognition of god in everyone , " it said in a statement .
the organisation 's co-directors , doug pritchard and carol rose , appealed to people to " set aside inclinations to vilify or demonise others , no matter what they have done " .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said he was saddened by the news and remained very concerned about the fate of the other hostages .
" this clearly raises the anxiety about the other hostages and we have been in contact with mr kember 's family . "
cause of death unclear us state department spokesman noel clay said the body had been identified as that of mr fox by the fbi .
timeline of abduction 26 november : tom fox and three other peace workers abducted 30 november : video footage of the hostages aired on al-jazeera 2 december : second video of the hostages aired .
their captors threaten to kill them unless their demands are met by 8 december 8 december : third video is aired on al-jazeera showing tom fox and uk hostage norman kember wearing orange jumpsuits , blindfolded and shackled .
the captors ' deadline is extended to 10 december 28 january : new video of hostages , dated 21 january , aired on al-jazeera 5 march : vigils are held to mark 100 days since the kidnappings 7 march : new video of three of the hostages , dated 28 february , aired on al-jazeera - tom fox does not appear on the tape 10 march : tom fox confirmed dead " while additional forensics will be completed in the united states , they believe this is the body of tom fox .
" the family has been notified and our heartfelt condolences go out to the family . "
mr clay added that it was not immediately known how mr fox had died .
iraqi security officials said on saturday that his body had been found with his hands tied , and injuries to the back .
the four men were travelling with canadian-based international peace group christian peacemaker teams when they were seized by a group calling itself the swords of truth .
mr fox , 54 , came from clearbrook , virginia , and had two children .
after seizing the four , the kidnappers demanded the release of all prisoners being held in iraq , and have so far released four videos of the hostages .
however , mr fox did not appear on the last one , which was shown by al-jazeera tv on tuesday , and dated 28 february .
the silent video appeared to show the other three men pleading for their governments to secure their release .
there has been no further word on the condition or whereabouts of the remaining three hostages .
british muslim spokesman anas al tikriti told the bbc the news of mr fox 's death came as a serious blow to the hopes of securing the release of the others .
" we were hoping in light of the fact that wave after wave of detainees were being released that maybe the abductors would see that in a good way and hopefully release the hostages . "

mr fox was seized last november , along with briton norman kember and canadians james loney and harmeet singh sooden .
a video tape showing the other three men was released on tuesday , but mr fox did not feature on it .
mr fox , 54 , had been working with iraqi human rights organisations for the past two years .
his parent organisation , christian peacemaker teams , said it mourned his loss .
" tom fox ... combined a lightness of spirit , a firm opposition to all oppression and the recognition of god in everyone , " it said in a statement .
the organisation 's co-directors , doug pritchard and carol rose , appealed to people to " set aside inclinations to vilify or demonise others , no matter what they have done " .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said he was saddened by the news and remained very concerned about the fate of the other hostages .
" this clearly raises the anxiety about the other hostages and we have been in contact with mr kember 's family . "
cause of death unclear us state department spokesman noel clay said the body had been identified as that of mr fox by the fbi .
timeline of abduction 26 november : tom fox and three other peace workers abducted 30 november : video footage of the hostages aired on al-jazeera 2 december : second video of the hostages aired .
their captors threaten to kill them unless their demands are met by 8 december 8 december : third video is aired on al-jazeera showing tom fox and uk hostage norman kember wearing orange jumpsuits , blindfolded and shackled .
the captors ' deadline is extended to 10 december 28 january : new video of hostages , dated 21 january , aired on al-jazeera 5 march : vigils are held to mark 100 days since the kidnappings 7 march : new video of three of the hostages , dated 28 february , aired on al-jazeera - tom fox does not appear on the tape 10 march : tom fox confirmed dead profile of the peace group " while additional forensics will be completed in the united states , they believe this is the body of tom fox .
" the family has been notified and our heartfelt condolences go out to the family . "
mr clay added that it was not immediately known how mr fox had died .
iraqi security officials said on saturday that his body had been found with his hands tied , and injuries to the back .
the four men were travelling with canadian-based international peace group christian peacemaker teams when they were seized by a group calling itself the swords of truth .
mr fox , 54 , came from clearbrook , virginia , and had two children .
after seizing the four , the kidnappers demanded the release of all prisoners being held in iraq , and have so far released four videos of the hostages .
however , mr fox did not appear on the last one , which was shown by al-jazeera tv on tuesday , and dated 28 february .
the silent video appeared to show the other three men pleading for their governments to secure their release .
there has been no further word on the condition or whereabouts of the remaining three hostages .
british muslim spokesman anas al tikriti told the bbc the news of mr fox 's death came as a serious blow to the hopes of securing the release of the others .
" we were hoping in light of the fact that wave after wave of detainees were being released that maybe the abductors would see that in a good way and hopefully release the hostages . "

the ttc group runs education courses in mid and north wales , and thinks many drivers do not know how long it takes for the body to get rid of alcohol .
the firm said up to a fifth of people on its courses had been arrested the morning after they had been drinking .
director jenny wynn said the increase in licensing opening hours was " most probably " part of the issue .
she said : " because pubs are opening later , people are drinking into the early hours .
" while getting a taxi home at night , they are still over the limit when driving to work the next morning . "
the home office is still assessing the full impact of the changes in licensing laws in november last year , which allowed for extended drinking hours .
in the run-up to christmas , south wales police said they caught nearly 100 drink drivers during the first 10 days of their festive anti-drink drive campaign .
the force warned revellers not to drive for 24 hours after a heavy night 's drinking .
but ms wynn thinks many people are still ignoring the warning not to drink and drive .
she said : " drink-driving is not going away .
people are still getting behind the wheel of a car after drinking alcohol . "
driving ban a spokeswoman for the company added : " we reckon that more people will be drinking for longer and later at night , which will then cause problems in the morning . "
the ttc group 's own figures showed 1,086 people were convicted of drink-driving in north and mid wales last year , 11 cases more than in 2004 .

but it says the department of trade and industry was allowing the eu to push through a deal that would harm poorer countries by offering no substantial cuts in agricultural subsidies while demanding poor countries open their industrial markets to unfair competition .
