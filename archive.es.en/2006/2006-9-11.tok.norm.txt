" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .
19 , 2005 .
marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .
tasteful souvenirs ?
it didn ’ t take long for dozens of souvenirs to appear in window displays of virtually every store in town .
" the pope caps - that ’ s what it all started with on april 20 , 2005 , " said roswitha leukert , pointing to a tray with pastries in her bakery , which sits just a few houses down the street from the birth house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local bakeries in marktl are busy baking pope goodies since then , leukert ’ s husband wolfgang has come up with many new products to celebrate the pope .
while benediktschnitten , or benedict slices , are also sold at another bakery , the leukerts have copyrighted their signature miter pastries , roswitha leukert said .
" we just wanted a symbol that looks good and tastes great , " she said , adding that she feels martkl ’ s papal memorabilia are much more tasteful than those she saw during a pilgrimage to rome earlier this year .
besides , why shouldn ’ t marktl cater to its new-found visitors ?
" it ’ s really quite normal to present oneself a little , " leukert said , adding that she was looking forward to wave to the pope from outside her shop .
" i still don ’ t understand why people made such a big fuss about it . "
getting a piece of the cake others saw things slightly differently .
" everyone ’ s trying to get a piece of the cake , " said a 29-year-old man , who recently moved to marktl and asked not to be named .
" some here are more catholic than the pope . "
but even he said that he was going to see the pope come home on monday - just like virtually all other villagers who had already decked out their houses in the vatican ’ s national colors of white and yellow and were flying papal flags from everything , including tractors .
" i thought about it for a long time , but if it happens in front of my doorstep , why shouldn ’ t i go ? " he said .
benedikt dittmann said he will also welcome his namesake - and not just because he ’ s volunteering as a red cross worker during the visit .
" it ’ s all a little exaggerated , but it doesn ’ t hurt marktl and helps a little to make the town look nicer , " said the 16-year-old as he observed the commotion on the village ’ s market square , where tv teams and police officers were finishing up their preparations . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope warns of " deafness to god " in first mass on german visit pope benedict xvi warned on sunday that the modern world was becoming " deaf " to god 's message , as he gave the first open-air mass of his visit to his native region of bavaria in germany .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .

" as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.

" muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .

" if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 11.09.2006 opinion : modernity and progess will triumph in the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after 9/11 , the civilized and free world is still sorely tested in its battle against terror and backwardness , according to deutsche welle 's miodrag soric . time , as the ancient romans put it , is the master of everything .
it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.09.2006 european press review : five years after 9/11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new yorkers marked the fith anniversary of sept .
11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .
udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .
" we have to get to the root of the problem .

five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .

now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .
udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .
" we have to get to the root of the problem .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .

11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .
udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .
" we have to get to the root of the problem .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

"
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around . elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis . the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 . in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels . in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .

marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .

11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware . " interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures september 11 , 2001 - september 11 , 2006 feedback how has your life changed after the attacks on sept .

11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .

udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .

11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .
the truth is that the enemies of the internet keep it under control , says julien pain of reporters without borders .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.

it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .

or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.
" the islam summit is a good start to recognizing the 3.5 million muslims as discussion partners .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .

11 by reaffirming their commitment to defeat terrorism .
but some expressed reservations about how the united states has battled the threats . in a veiled criticism of us policies , german chancellor angela merkel warned on monday that human rights must be respected and that " even in the fight against terrorism , the end does not justify the means . " " our battle against islamic terrorism will only succeed if we strengthen democratic and economic development in crisis regions and cultivate respect for human rights , " merkel said in a statement .

it said any anti-terrorism measures " must comply with obligations under international law , in particular international humanitarian law . "

us-french relations soured after the us invaded iraq , but chirac said france is committed to fighting terrorism . " during these days of sad commemoration , i want to express the friendship and solidarity of the french people with the american people , " chirac wrote .
" together , we pursue our determined struggle against this blight that nothing can ever justify . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and britain 's prince andrew , attending separate commemoration ceremonies in the united states , offered words of unity and sympathy . " the heinous attack upon america was an attack upon us all .
with america , britain stands in the front line against islamic fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens , " thatcher was slated to tell a ceremony in washington dc . remembering those who died in new york , prince andrew praised the bravery of the families of the victims .
" it is incredible to see the strength of character these families have shown in the face of such adversity , " he told britain 's domestic news agency , the press association . memorial services were planned in several european cities , including berlin and london . in rome , the city 's mayor said several sites in italy 's capital would be dedicated to the sept .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .
the truth is that the enemies of the internet keep it under control , says julien pain of reporters without borders .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .

" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .
19 , 2005 .
marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .
tasteful souvenirs ?
it didn ’ t take long for dozens of souvenirs to appear in window displays of virtually every store in town .
" the pope caps - that ’ s what it all started with on april 20 , 2005 , " said roswitha leukert , pointing to a tray with pastries in her bakery , which sits just a few houses down the street from the birth house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local bakeries in marktl are busy baking pope goodies since then , leukert ’ s husband wolfgang has come up with many new products to celebrate the pope .
while benediktschnitten , or benedict slices , are also sold at another bakery , the leukerts have copyrighted their signature miter pastries , roswitha leukert said .
" we just wanted a symbol that looks good and tastes great , " she said , adding that she feels martkl ’ s papal memorabilia are much more tasteful than those she saw during a pilgrimage to rome earlier this year .
besides , why shouldn ’ t marktl cater to its new-found visitors ?
" it ’ s really quite normal to present oneself a little , " leukert said , adding that she was looking forward to wave to the pope from outside her shop .
" i still don ’ t understand why people made such a big fuss about it . "
getting a piece of the cake others saw things slightly differently .
" everyone ’ s trying to get a piece of the cake , " said a 29-year-old man , who recently moved to marktl and asked not to be named .
" some here are more catholic than the pope . "
but even he said that he was going to see the pope come home on monday - just like virtually all other villagers who had already decked out their houses in the vatican ’ s national colors of white and yellow and were flying papal flags from everything , including tractors .
" i thought about it for a long time , but if it happens in front of my doorstep , why shouldn ’ t i go ? " he said .
benedikt dittmann said he will also welcome his namesake - and not just because he ’ s volunteering as a red cross worker during the visit .
" it ’ s all a little exaggerated , but it doesn ’ t hurt marktl and helps a little to make the town look nicer , " said the 16-year-old as he observed the commotion on the village ’ s market square , where tv teams and police officers were finishing up their preparations . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope warns of " deafness to god " in first mass on german visit pope benedict xvi warned on sunday that the modern world was becoming " deaf " to god 's message , as he gave the first open-air mass of his visit to his native region of bavaria in germany .

" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .
19 , 2005 .
marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .
tasteful souvenirs ?
it didn ’ t take long for dozens of souvenirs to appear in window displays of virtually every store in town .
" the pope caps - that ’ s what it all started with on april 20 , 2005 , " said roswitha leukert , pointing to a tray with pastries in her bakery , which sits just a few houses down the street from the birth house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local bakeries in marktl are busy baking pope goodies since then , leukert ’ s husband wolfgang has come up with many new products to celebrate the pope .
while benediktschnitten , or benedict slices , are also sold at another bakery , the leukerts have copyrighted their signature miter pastries , roswitha leukert said .
" we just wanted a symbol that looks good and tastes great , " she said , adding that she feels martkl ’ s papal memorabilia are much more tasteful than those she saw during a pilgrimage to rome earlier this year .
besides , why shouldn ’ t marktl cater to its new-found visitors ?
" it ’ s really quite normal to present oneself a little , " leukert said , adding that she was looking forward to wave to the pope from outside her shop .
" i still don ’ t understand why people made such a big fuss about it . "
getting a piece of the cake others saw things slightly differently .
" everyone ’ s trying to get a piece of the cake , " said a 29-year-old man , who recently moved to marktl and asked not to be named .
" some here are more catholic than the pope . "
but even he said that he was going to see the pope come home on monday - just like virtually all other villagers who had already decked out their houses in the vatican ’ s national colors of white and yellow and were flying papal flags from everything , including tractors .
" i thought about it for a long time , but if it happens in front of my doorstep , why shouldn ’ t i go ? " he said .
benedikt dittmann said he will also welcome his namesake - and not just because he ’ s volunteering as a red cross worker during the visit .
" it ’ s all a little exaggerated , but it doesn ’ t hurt marktl and helps a little to make the town look nicer , " said the 16-year-old as he observed the commotion on the village ’ s market square , where tv teams and police officers were finishing up their preparations . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope warns of " deafness to god " in first mass on german visit pope benedict xvi warned on sunday that the modern world was becoming " deaf " to god 's message , as he gave the first open-air mass of his visit to his native region of bavaria in germany .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .

11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .

11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .

11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .

after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .

she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .

you bet ! after parking in downtown munich near the english garden , the first sign of surfing was a discarded wrapper from a stick of australian surfing wax .
just ahead , a couple of guys in black neoprene were jogging across the road , surf boards under their arms . ask any local in munich and they 'll tell you they 've got great beer and , with the highest annual number of sunny days in the country , they 're practically germany 's california . the absence of the pacific ocean and malibu beach is n't holding locals like rolf back from catching some waves . " when you compare it to the ocean , everything happens much faster because you have to do radical turns , like 180 degrees in a few seconds .
and the water comes out of the tunnel at five meters per hour , which is like 36 kilometers per hour , so it 's not too slow , " said ralf . the real thing - almost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's easy , anyone could have a go at it , " said ralf the tunnel ralf mentioned is on the eisbach , a tributary of the isar river that flows through the middle of munich .
as the waters of the eisbach emerge from an underground tunnel , they produce a small wave about 12 meters -lrb- 39 feet -rrb- wide with a clean face - almost as good as the real thing . only one person can surf at a time and , since it 's not possible to paddle upriver to the crest of the wave , regulars have worked out a number of ways to catch it , said rolf .
many sit on the riverbank , set their feet on the surfboard , stand up and slide down the face of the wave . others simply throw the board into the water and jump on . surfers come from near and far word on the eisbach wave has spread and it now attracts more than just the locals - like adam brown , an australian surfing instructor from the east coast surf mecca of byron bay . " it 's quite fast and there 's a hole in front of the wave , so it gives you the feeling of a much faster wave .
it 's got a lot of potential for a small wave , " said brown , who decided to check out the famed munich wave on a recent visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warning sign remains unheeded while surfing at eisbach may be fun for tourists and locals , it 's actually illegal .
not everyone seems to pay attention to the signs , though . no surfing allowed " we 've refrained from fines to far , but it there is a serious accident it 's going to become a problem , " said rainer herzog , garden director for the bavarian palace , garden and lake administration . nevertheless , on any given day at least a dozen surfers can be seen testing their skills on the eisbach wave .
and if you ask the right local , they might let you in on some other good surf spots nearby . in fact , surfing is popular enough that a munich company has started making producing special river boards . munich 's city river wave may not be up there with hawaii 's pipeline or bells beach in australia , but for many land-locked surfers in germany it 's the next best thing . guy degen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .

i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .

we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : five years on : how sept .
11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set .

" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room . "
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around . elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis . the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 . in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels . in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

" lebanon has made the request to the united nations at the weekend and it has been passed on to us , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press briefing . wilhelm said berlin was now waiting for lebanon and the united nations to finalize an " operations plan and the rules of engagement " before it sends ships to the middle east . germany has offered to lead the naval component of the mission and is expected to contribute 2,000 men , but the bundeswehr 's intervention has been mired in confusion about its mandate and timing . berlin frustrated by uncertain mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's navy is still waiting for sailing orders to lebanon berlin last week delayed an announcement about the size of its contribution because of tension between lebanon and israel about what should come first - ending the sea blockade of lebanon or deploying german vessels . israel on friday lifted the blockade it imposed on its northern neighbor at the start of its 34-day offensive to rout hezbollah militia in southern lebanon . this paved the way for beirut to make a formal request for the deployment of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- along its coast to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah by sea . but german politicians and the press said beirut and berlin were now struggling to agree about whether foreign forces could enter lebanon 's waters . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said germany wanted to be sure that its navy could stop and search any suspect ships off lebanon 's coast . " we need a clear mandate that will give us the possibility to fulfill our orders .
and this means a mandate to control the coastline and to stop arms smuggling , " he said . the party 's parliamentary spokesman for defense , bernd siebert , said beirut did not want to allow foreign ships within seven miles -lrb- 13 kilometers -rrb- of its coast , rendering the planned intervention " pointless . " possible compromise ? german daily die welt reported in an advance extract of its tuesday edition that germany was mulling a compromise whereby its ships could pursue suspect vessels into lebanese waters only if asked by beirut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon 's coastline has been devastated by the war the süddeutsche zeitung also said that lebanese prime minister fuad siniora was insisting that lebanon would patrol its own seaways , but should be able to fall back onto the help of the un forces . german chancellor angela merkel has appeared increasingly impatient with the difficulty in reaching a deal with beirut .
she said last week that without a strong mandate there was no justification for sending german troops into danger . the united nations said at the weekend it hoped an agreement could be reached to allow german vessels to deploy under un command within two weeks .
in the meanwhile a un-backed flotilla of french , greek and italian ships have begun patrolling the lebanese coast on a temporary basis . german opposition resists mideast mission there is considerable resistance within german political circles to sending the navy to the middle east . the left party , consisting of social democrat defectors and former communists , has warned that it would open germany to terrorist attacks , coming just weeks after a failed plot to blow up german trains .
four lebanese suspects and a syrian have been charged in connection with the plot . the liberal free democrats have for their part warned that the mission could compromise germany 's neutrality in the middle east . denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden have also offered to contribute patrol vessels to unifil .

" lebanon has made the request to the united nations at the weekend and it has been passed on to us , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told a press briefing . wilhelm said berlin was now waiting for lebanon and the united nations to finalize an " operations plan and the rules of engagement " before it sends ships to the middle east . germany has offered to lead the naval component of the mission and is expected to contribute 2,000 men , but the bundeswehr 's intervention has been mired in confusion about its mandate and timing . berlin frustrated by uncertain mandate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's navy is still waiting for sailing orders to lebanon berlin last week delayed an announcement about the size of its contribution because of tension between lebanon and israel about what should come first - ending the sea blockade of lebanon or deploying german vessels . israel on friday lifted the blockade it imposed on its northern neighbor at the start of its 34-day offensive to rout hezbollah militia in southern lebanon . this paved the way for beirut to make a formal request for the deployment of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- along its coast to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah by sea . but german politicians and the press said beirut and berlin were now struggling to agree about whether foreign forces could enter lebanon 's waters . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said germany wanted to be sure that its navy could stop and search any suspect ships off lebanon 's coast . " we need a clear mandate that will give us the possibility to fulfill our orders .
and this means a mandate to control the coastline and to stop arms smuggling , " he said . the party 's parliamentary spokesman for defense , bernd siebert , said beirut did not want to allow foreign ships within seven miles -lrb- 13 kilometers -rrb- of its coast , rendering the planned intervention " pointless . " possible compromise ? german daily die welt reported in an advance extract of its tuesday edition that germany was mulling a compromise whereby its ships could pursue suspect vessels into lebanese waters only if asked by beirut . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanon 's coastline has been devastated by the war the süddeutsche zeitung also said that lebanese prime minister fuad siniora was insisting that lebanon would patrol its own seaways , but should be able to fall back onto the help of the un forces . german chancellor angela merkel has appeared increasingly impatient with the difficulty in reaching a deal with beirut .
she said last week that without a strong mandate there was no justification for sending german troops into danger . the united nations said at the weekend it hoped an agreement could be reached to allow german vessels to deploy under un command within two weeks .
in the meanwhile a un-backed flotilla of french , greek and italian ships have begun patrolling the lebanese coast on a temporary basis . german opposition resists mideast mission there is considerable resistance within german political circles to sending the navy to the middle east . the left party , consisting of social democrat defectors and former communists , has warned that it would open germany to terrorist attacks , coming just weeks after a failed plot to blow up german trains .
four lebanese suspects and a syrian have been charged in connection with the plot . the liberal free democrats have for their part warned that the mission could compromise germany 's neutrality in the middle east . denmark , the netherlands , norway and sweden have also offered to contribute patrol vessels to unifil .
these nations have received the same request from lebanon via the united nations as germany has , defense spokesman thomas raabe said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanese naval force takes shape germany has come closer to deploying its navy in the middle east following israel 's lifting of its crippling three-week naval blockade of lebanon on friday .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .
19 , 2005 .
marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .
tasteful souvenirs ?
it didn ’ t take long for dozens of souvenirs to appear in window displays of virtually every store in town .
" the pope caps - that ’ s what it all started with on april 20 , 2005 , " said roswitha leukert , pointing to a tray with pastries in her bakery , which sits just a few houses down the street from the birth house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local bakeries in marktl are busy baking pope goodies since then , leukert ’ s husband wolfgang has come up with many new products to celebrate the pope .
while benediktschnitten , or benedict slices , are also sold at another bakery , the leukerts have copyrighted their signature miter pastries , roswitha leukert said .
" we just wanted a symbol that looks good and tastes great , " she said , adding that she feels martkl ’ s papal memorabilia are much more tasteful than those she saw during a pilgrimage to rome earlier this year .
besides , why shouldn ’ t marktl cater to its new-found visitors ?
" it ’ s really quite normal to present oneself a little , " leukert said , adding that she was looking forward to wave to the pope from outside her shop .
" i still don ’ t understand why people made such a big fuss about it . "
getting a piece of the cake others saw things slightly differently .
" everyone ’ s trying to get a piece of the cake , " said a 29-year-old man , who recently moved to marktl and asked not to be named .
" some here are more catholic than the pope . "
but even he said that he was going to see the pope come home on monday - just like virtually all other villagers who had already decked out their houses in the vatican ’ s national colors of white and yellow and were flying papal flags from everything , including tractors .
" i thought about it for a long time , but if it happens in front of my doorstep , why shouldn ’ t i go ? " he said .
benedikt dittmann said he will also welcome his namesake - and not just because he ’ s volunteering as a red cross worker during the visit .
" it ’ s all a little exaggerated , but it doesn ’ t hurt marktl and helps a little to make the town look nicer , " said the 16-year-old as he observed the commotion on the village ’ s market square , where tv teams and police officers were finishing up their preparations . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope warns of " deafness to god " in first mass on german visit pope benedict xvi warned on sunday that the modern world was becoming " deaf " to god 's message , as he gave the first open-air mass of his visit to his native region of bavaria in germany .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room . "
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around . elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis . the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 . in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels . in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .

udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .

the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .

11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .

11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .

problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .

the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.
" the islam summit is a good start to recognizing the 3.5 million muslims as discussion partners .

it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .

we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : five years on : how sept .
11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware . " interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures september 11 , 2001 - september 11 , 2006 feedback how has your life changed after the attacks on sept .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room . "
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around . elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis . the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 . in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels . in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .
the entire museum will open to the public on sept .

it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware .

it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .

but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .

this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware . " interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures september 11 , 2001 - september 11 , 2006 feedback how has your life changed after the attacks on sept .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.

britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism .

sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .

" they ’ re not very well organized if they still have to work on a sunday , " said the 45-year-old pilgrim , who had biked 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- from western bavaria with his wife and friends to see the pope celebrate mass in nearby altötting on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl residents clean the birth house of the pope after a color attack what frohnwieser didn ’ t know was that village officials were trying to deal with a last-minute act of vandalism : someone had thrown blue paint on the freshly renovated house the night before .
though it 's still unclear who was responsible , authorities in marktl are confident they will be done before the pope arrives .
" we ’ re finishing up here and will be ready , " said mayor hubert gschwender as he observed the repairs .
" everything began here " the house is now owned by the catholic church and will open for visitors just after the pope ’ s visit .
benedict is not scheduled to enter it during his 15-minute visit that will include a quick drive through town , where he will be able to see the new column erected in his honor and stop for prayer in marktl ’ s church , where he was baptized .
" everything began here , " josef kaiser , the town ’ s catholic pastor , recently told dw-radio .
" here his -lrb- the pope 's -rrb- parents gave him the gift of life , here he learned to speak and walk , " kaiser said .
" the family was only here for two years , but this was the foundation .
without marktl , he wouldn ’ t be here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl children wave in front of benedict 's birth house in 2005 after he was elected pope a sleepy bavarian village with some 2,700 residents , marktl was catapulted into the global limelight when cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope on aug .
19 , 2005 .
marktl was immediately swarming with journalists , who were soon followed by pilgrims eager to see where benedict was from .
tasteful souvenirs ?
it didn ’ t take long for dozens of souvenirs to appear in window displays of virtually every store in town .
" the pope caps - that ’ s what it all started with on april 20 , 2005 , " said roswitha leukert , pointing to a tray with pastries in her bakery , which sits just a few houses down the street from the birth house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local bakeries in marktl are busy baking pope goodies since then , leukert ’ s husband wolfgang has come up with many new products to celebrate the pope .
while benediktschnitten , or benedict slices , are also sold at another bakery , the leukerts have copyrighted their signature miter pastries , roswitha leukert said .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .

italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .

likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.
" the islam summit is a good start to recognizing the 3.5 million muslims as discussion partners .

11 by reaffirming their commitment to defeat terrorism .
but some expressed reservations about how the united states has battled the threats . in a veiled criticism of us policies , german chancellor angela merkel warned on monday that human rights must be respected and that " even in the fight against terrorism , the end does not justify the means . " " our battle against islamic terrorism will only succeed if we strengthen democratic and economic development in crisis regions and cultivate respect for human rights , " merkel said in a statement .
" besides firmness and international unity , our motto in this fight should be respect for international law and respect and tolerance for other cultures . " one of us president george w. bush 's closest european allies , merkel nonetheless has criticized american human-rights policies .
on saturday , she took aim at bush 's acknowledgement that the cia operated secret prisons to detain terrorism suspects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel stressed international unity " we must be fair as well as tough " government and rights groups have criticized us policy since sept .
11 for trampling international law and formenting further attacks . terry davis , head of the council of europe , said in an earlier statement , " to be effective we must be fair as well as tough … when they kill , they hope to provoke a disproportionate , indiscriminate and unfair reaction … but they are afraid of justice . "
a statement from the 25-member european union bloc also stressed the importance of legal rights .
it said any anti-terrorism measures " must comply with obligations under international law , in particular international humanitarian law . "
the eu also commemorated the sept .
11 attacks as a reminder that " terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples … no cause , no grievance , can justify acts of terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac says france stands together with the us on sunday , french president jacques chirac sent a handwritten letter to bush pledging france 's solidarity .
us-french relations soured after the us invaded iraq , but chirac said france is committed to fighting terrorism . " during these days of sad commemoration , i want to express the friendship and solidarity of the french people with the american people , " chirac wrote .
" together , we pursue our determined struggle against this blight that nothing can ever justify . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and britain 's prince andrew , attending separate commemoration ceremonies in the united states , offered words of unity and sympathy . " the heinous attack upon america was an attack upon us all .

" together , we pursue our determined struggle against this blight that nothing can ever justify . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and britain 's prince andrew , attending separate commemoration ceremonies in the united states , offered words of unity and sympathy . " the heinous attack upon america was an attack upon us all .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 11.09.2006 opinion : modernity and progess will triumph in the end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after 9/11 , the civilized and free world is still sorely tested in its battle against terror and backwardness , according to deutsche welle 's miodrag soric . time , as the ancient romans put it , is the master of everything .
it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .
in the war against terror and backwardness , the civilized world will have to undergo an extreme test of endurance . miodrag soric is editor-in-chief for dw-radio 's foreign languages . -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bali was a very important wake-up call " dw-world.de spoke with rohan gunaratna , the head of terrorism research at the institute of defense and strategic studies in singapore , about how australia has changed since sept.11 and the bali bombings .

" together , we pursue our determined struggle against this blight that nothing can ever justify . " former british prime minister margaret thatcher and britain 's prince andrew , attending separate commemoration ceremonies in the united states , offered words of unity and sympathy . " the heinous attack upon america was an attack upon us all .
with america , britain stands in the front line against islamic fanatics who hate our beliefs , our liberties and our citizens , " thatcher was slated to tell a ceremony in washington dc . remembering those who died in new york , prince andrew praised the bravery of the families of the victims .
" it is incredible to see the strength of character these families have shown in the face of such adversity , " he told britain 's domestic news agency , the press association . memorial services were planned in several european cities , including berlin and london . in rome , the city 's mayor said several sites in italy 's capital would be dedicated to the sept .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .

11 with somber ceremonies many european papers strongly criticized us president bush 's response to sept .
11 , accusing it of bungling its " war on terror " and squandering global goodwill by invading iraq . reflecting france 's vocal opposition to the us-led war against iraq , left-leaning french daily liberation said president bush 's leadership over the past five years was " disastrous . "
" the bush administration has succeeded in destroying the huge pool of compassion and solidarity which gripped the world after sept .
11 , " the paper said . "
-lrb- bush -rrb- is helping to turn the planet into a vast battleground , precipitating the clash of civilizations to which the most radical jihadists aspire " , it wrote .
britain 's independent also remembered the goodwill of five years ago when there were " images of a world briefly united in sympathy for an america reeling and grieving from the attack on the twin towers and the deaths of almost 3,000 new yorkers . "
" how moving but dated they seem today , " the paper said .
summing up the mood in the british press , the financial times said : " the way the bush administration has trampled on the international rule of law and geneva conventions , while abrogating civil liberties and expanding executive power at home , has done huge damage not only to america 's reputation but , more broadly , to the attractive power of western values . "
austria 's der standard pinpointed the war in iraq as a turning point which almost caused the trans-atlantic partnership to break up .
" the world of today has been molded by self-willed decisions in the white house and not by the collapse of the twin towers " , it said .
italy 's la stampa , which sees no end to the war on terror , said : " there is no victory in sight , no indication about how the undertaking might finish .
-lrb- instead we see -rrb- a proliferation of ethnic-religious wars , of terrorist attacks in various parts of the globe . "
likewise in spain , el pais said the bush administration was using the september 11 attacks to pursue the agenda of the " neo-cons , " whom it accused of " pursuing unilateral policies , abandoning diplomacy in favour of military might , eroding civil liberaties and expanding presidential powers . "
" the result , five years after , is a more dangerous world , " the paper said .
" but the worst is that the methods of the terrorists contaminated the spirit of the democracies which fight them . "
germany 's conservative die welt on the other hand , did defend the use of military action in the fighting terrorism , but with the following proviso , " the terror principle can and must be countered by military means , but security policy measures must be taken without betraying one 's democratic principles , " it said .
the paper was referring to last week 's disclosures by president bush that the cia held high level operatives of al-qaeda in secret prisons , unleashing a flurry of criticism in many european countries , including germany .
berlin 's left leaning tagesspiegel urged cooperation between america and europe .
" they should open up a dialogue with the islamic world , but there are certain principles where there is no compromise : democracy , freedom of religion and opinion , equal rights for women , the security of israel , are only a few examples .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .
whoever denies the core of humanness , fails .
that was true for east-block communism as well as for nazism .
and it is also true for all other totalitarian ideologies and regimes , including islamism . osama bin laden may be hiding along the afghan-pakistani border region , while his diffuse ideas and conspiracy theories are being spread throughout the virtual world .

it puts things in their place .
for many politicians , the terrorist attacks on september 11 , 2001 , are considered a " historical caesura . "
they speak of a " change in the course of time . "
or it was the " day that changed the world . " indeed , the murder of thousands of innocent people in new york captured on the world 's television screens has dramatically affected the emotions of the american population .
the united states is at war , and that is what george w. bush always repeats whenever he demands more money for the department of defense or infringes on americans ' civil liberties . more than ever before , the us has taken on an active role in shaping the so-called muslim world .
american troops drove the taliban regime in afghanistan from power .
after all , it was the islamists in kabul who had provided shelter to al-qaeda to plan and prepare the 9/11 attacks .
now , washington and its western allies , including germany , are helping the afghans rebuild their country .
at the same time , the bush administration tries to propagate democracy in other muslim countries . it is exactly this push that many muslims perceive as aggression .
they distrust western democracies and their way of life .
in their eyes , the secularism of the west is blasphemy . muslims are enduring more suffering than " infidels " in addition , the us is an ally of the muslim world 's arch enemy , israel .
therefore , americans encounter rejection , antipathy , and occasionally hatred , in most parts of the muslim world .
whenever someone like osama bin laden declares war on america , he can count on the sympathies of many muslims . the top terrorist 's attacks five years ago set a wheel of violence in motion that seems to be spinning faster and faster , reaching almost every continent on earth .
the terror feeds on itself , and it is not only directed against the so-called " infidels , " christians and jews .
for the most part , 90 percent of terror victims are muslims , primarily in iraq .
sunnis battle against shiites , radical against moderate muslims . fanaticism loses to progress it seems then even more incomprehensible , that in arab states the numbers of those who approve of mass murderers are increasing .
they are crowned with an aura of martyrdom for their acts.good and evil , as categories , are dissipating .
fanaticism and irrationality go hand in hand . the origins of such developments can be found in the 1990s .
the choice of words in bin laden 's 1998 declaration of war against , what he called the " alliance of zionist crusaders , " speaks volumes .
apparently , he is only able to apply a simplified , template-like understanding to the world .
the complicated processes accompanying globalization seem to demand too much from him as well as his supporters . it is entirely possible that the terrorist attacks on september 11 will go down in history books as a revolt against modernity , as an attempt to pulverize the values of the civilized world with airplanes .
yet this experiment is doomed to fail .
and not because the us is a powerful country that is able to defend itself .
no , but rather because history has shown that in the end , progress prevails , modernity wins . history also teaches something else .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .
the truth is that the enemies of the internet keep it under control , says julien pain of reporters without borders .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism . " as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.
" muslims make up the second largest religious group after christianity and they should be just as accepted in germany as the jewish community and be considered a component of the religious infrastructure here . " muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step . " i assume that all the muslim groups will be invited , that all of them will participate in discussions and that their suggestions will be accepted , " said sen.

and the water comes out of the tunnel at five meters per hour , which is like 36 kilometers per hour , so it 's not too slow , " said ralf . the real thing - almost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's easy , anyone could have a go at it , " said ralf the tunnel ralf mentioned is on the eisbach , a tributary of the isar river that flows through the middle of munich .
as the waters of the eisbach emerge from an underground tunnel , they produce a small wave about 12 meters -lrb- 39 feet -rrb- wide with a clean face - almost as good as the real thing . only one person can surf at a time and , since it 's not possible to paddle upriver to the crest of the wave , regulars have worked out a number of ways to catch it , said rolf .
many sit on the riverbank , set their feet on the surfboard , stand up and slide down the face of the wave . others simply throw the board into the water and jump on . surfers come from near and far word on the eisbach wave has spread and it now attracts more than just the locals - like adam brown , an australian surfing instructor from the east coast surf mecca of byron bay . " it 's quite fast and there 's a hole in front of the wave , so it gives you the feeling of a much faster wave .
it 's got a lot of potential for a small wave , " said brown , who decided to check out the famed munich wave on a recent visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warning sign remains unheeded while surfing at eisbach may be fun for tourists and locals , it 's actually illegal .
not everyone seems to pay attention to the signs , though . no surfing allowed " we 've refrained from fines to far , but it there is a serious accident it 's going to become a problem , " said rainer herzog , garden director for the bavarian palace , garden and lake administration . nevertheless , on any given day at least a dozen surfers can be seen testing their skills on the eisbach wave .
and if you ask the right local , they might let you in on some other good surf spots nearby . in fact , surfing is popular enough that a munich company has started making producing special river boards . munich 's city river wave may not be up there with hawaii 's pipeline or bells beach in australia , but for many land-locked surfers in germany it 's the next best thing . guy degen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .

11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .

11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .
udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .
" we have to get to the root of the problem .

11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware . " interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures september 11 , 2001 - september 11 , 2006 feedback how has your life changed after the attacks on sept .

" the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room . "

the entire museum will open to the public on sept .

" as a society , we should start giving islam political and social recognition , " said sen.

" muslim community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist acts by islamic fundamentalists have led to a one-sided image of the religion , said sen an impediment to dialogue is the absence of a political spokesperson for the larger muslim community .
sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .
experts say , however , that they only speak for a small number of muslims and that the groups have no plans to merge . expectations of germany and the muslim community in addition to receiving political , social and legal recognition , muslim organizations should be financially supported by the government , said sen. the construction of a mosque in duisburg , sponsored in part by the state of north rhine-westphalia , is an indication that this is already happening is some places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these cologne fifth-graders are participants in a pilot islam lesson another of sen 's wishes is the integration of islam in schools ' religion curriculum . " if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .

11 current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 " on that day , i just ran " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life goes on in manhattan , but not without deep scars dw-world.de talked with new yorkers working near the twin towers about what that day was like , how things have changed since then . gary , a psychotherapist o n broadway : " it 's impossible to put into a sound byte .
it 's very painful to continue to work with people who are still suffering and trying to come to terms with what happened that day . sometimes people have moved on ; sometimes people definitely have not .
at anniversaries these experiences can come back with strong intensity . everybody who walks past the world trade center site has a profound sense of the change .
there 's customarily been a sense that people who live below 14th street have a more nuanced sense of how sept.11 was and are more sensitive to glib commentary about it .
if you were down here in the morass of smoke and debris , there 's a vivid imprint of it on your mind . i do n't walk around with fear that i 'm not safe , but i think there are probably more heightened sensitivities .
people are more alert to things that do n't seem ordinary .
but the goal is for things to feel ordinary .
that comes and goes with the day , with the character of alerts , with the sound of loud noises . there are a lot of police training programs in lower manhattan so when you see the police massing you do n't know if it 's a training program or not .
you have a lack of clarity . " david , ow n er of a shoe repair shop o n broadway : " there was a big line of people in my store to use my phone because cell phones were n't working at that time .
it was a terrible experience .
i saw fire , i saw body parts .
on that day , i just ran .
i did n't even close my business .
everything was covered in dust when the building collapsed .
there was n't time to close the door . after 9/11 , customers came to me from all around - from new jersey and other parts - even if they did n't need repairs .
they just came to support me and keep me busy .
i was only able to pay my rent , nothing else .
this area used to have more businesses but it 's become more residential .
businesses left for other locations after 9/11 .
now business is picking up a little bit . i 'm afraid sometimes , especially in the subway .
you never know what might happen .
when you come near manhattan by subway , it gets you thinking .
but life goes on . " carl , a jeweler o n tri n ity place : " it was a shocking day .
it was something that you never expect .
i still think about it up to this day and it bothers me . i was especially proud to see the response from not just the general public but from the civil servants , the firemen and the police .
they were willing to do so much .
there was still order even in spite of the chaos .
they were trying to normalize the situation as best as possible by performing their task of direction , help and concern . i 've been down here 30 years and i know the area very well .
we 've lost a lot of people due to the incident .
a lot of companies have moved away and it 's been a constant uphill fight to bring my business back to where it was before .
things have improved .
even though it 's slow i do expect it to continue improving - i have a positive feeling about that . " magali , a medical secretary o n fulto n street : " people are more careful now .
everybody 's a little paranoid .
i think it 's easier now after so long .
at the beginning it was very hectic - every noise , every siren - you were always paying attention .
yes , i feel safe now .
i really try not to think about it . " na n cy , a bookstore ow n er o n chambers street : " it was surreal at the least .
there was extreme pandemonium throughout the streets .
people were just utterly confused .
they really did n't know what was going on at the beginning .
as the first building fell , people were still on the streets and they did n't know what to do .
they were just running north . we were in the store at the time .
we 're a college bookstore and it was our back-to-school season .
eventually , we had to lock the store and head north ourselves because it was just overwhelming - the dust and the amount of smoke and everything . we re-opened in the first week of october , but there are some businesses near us that never recovered because they lost out on so much business and could never regain that revenue again .
we have n't seen much of a rise in business ; it 's been a slight decline .
but we 're a different kind of market than a restaurant or a person who sells clothing . i think that the people are not as open now as they used to be - but people in new york were never that open to begin with .
they 're a little bit more wary of each other .
i do n't see people smile as much .
it 's a different mood , a different tone .
it could happen anywhere .
you just need to be aware . " interviews conducted by kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic pictures september 11 , 2001 - september 11 , 2006 feedback how has your life changed after the attacks on sept .

director faruk sen shared his thoughts with deutsche welle . the discussion on islamic terrorism in the past several years has raised interest in islam , said faruk sen , director of the center for turkish studies in essen , but attention has been limited to security matters , even though the overwhelming majority of germany 's 3.5 million muslims have nothing to do with terrorism .

sen said he would like to see an islamic council founded in germany , based on the french example .
it should consist of 20 to 25 representatives and serve as a kind of umbrella organization , he added . but with 2,300 different mosque associations in germany alone , establishing a common council wo n't be an easy task . three major umbrella organizations - the central council of muslims in germany , the islamic council for the republic of germany and the ditib , an organization for mosques in germany controlled by the secular turkish state - do already exist .

" if we want to reduce the influence of the various quran schools , we should include lessons on islam in german schools - which now have nearly 900,000 muslim children , " said sen. as for the muslim community , the director of the turkish center said he would like to see greater efforts toward social integration as well as equal treatment of men and women . countdown to the islam summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble is heading the islam summit minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble has invited representatives of the muslim community in germany to attend an islam summit in late september . its aim is to make progress toward constructive co-existence between muslims and christians in germany , but the conference has already taken heat from the muslim community .
ali kizilkaya , chairmen of the islamic council , said in a zdf television broadcast that he had not been invited and criticized the general invitation process for the event . sen sees the summit as a positive first step .

11 changed the world germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " current affairs -pipe- 11.09.2006 more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .
the truth is that the enemies of the internet keep it under control , says julien pain of reporters without borders .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it .

11 changed the world more than images : sept .
11 as a key event for online media daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .
11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .

11 " we americans now feel uncomfortable abroad " " on that day , i just ran " germany -pipe- 11.09.2006 germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a failed bomb plot on two trains in august 2006 rekindled the security debate in germany after the attacks on the usa in 2001 , germany 's readiness to help knew no limits .
five years later , this is no longer the case .
the feeling of security in germany , however , remains strong . former german chancellor gerhard schröder promised " unlimited solidarity " to the us after the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 - all the more so as it would soon turn out that three terrorists who took part in the attacks had previously lived in peace in the german city of hamburg . because there have been no grave terrorist attacks in germany , germans do not feel threatened .
according to a poll that studied german fears in aug .
2006 , cuts in the social welfare system and unemployment are very high on the list .
only one quarter of the germans polled are worried about the possibility of a terrorist attack .
climate changes , on the other hand , are troublesome to many more . defe n se i n hi n dukush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany refused to participate in the us-lead war in iraq germany 's seeming security is often explained with the country 's opposition to the iraq war - a popular decision , which is generally believed to have won schröder a re-election in 2004 .
pulling out of the " coalition of the willing " lead to a period of icy us-german relations , but at the same time germany 's voice in international relations gained in importance - especially after german soldiers got engaged in the fight against terror elsewhere . hardly anybody could have imagined before sept .
11 that large contingents of german soldiers would be stationed over years in afghanistan or the horn of africa .
now , however , germany is being defended " in hindukush , too , " as former german defense minister peter struck said .
resistance to this fact is mostly visible on the outer edges of the political spectrum . but germany 's apparent security turned out to be deceptive - at the latest in aug .
2006 , as suitcase bombs were discovered in koblenz and dortmund .
thanks to the badly constructed detonators and pure luck , two regional trains were not blown up .
but germany 's intelligence had no idea that attacks were being planned .
that is by no means a good sign for german anti-terror measures . taki n g measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shock of sept .
11 brought about changes in germany as well five years after sept .
11 , politicians are still trying to figure out a clear security concept .
after the shock of the terrorist attacks in the us , the coalition of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party set in motion a series of measures . then interior minister otto schilly tried his best to fulfill the wishes of germany 's intelligence agencies - whether they had to do with granting access to social , banking and travel data , surveillance of public and private spaces , freedom restrictions or the possibility of taking measures against foreign terrorist organizations in germany . the air safety law of 2005 once again stepped up the personnel , cargo and passenger checks .
originally , it even contained a paragraph allowing preventative mass murder as a prevention measure against an even grater mass murder - the shooting down of a kidnapped airplane .
germany 's highest court , however , decided that this stipulation was unconstitutional . security holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security measures on all german airports had to be tightened police sources say that in the months following sept .
11 , it was enough to slide a suggestion under the door of the interior minister in the evening to find it as a bill initiative the next morning . " since the attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , so many comprehensive safety packages were agreed on that we really ca n't say that there are security holes left in germany , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger of the opposition free-market , liberal fdp party . leutheusser-schnarrenberger was germany 's minister of justice from 1992 to 1996 .
she resigned in 1996 in protest of what she saw as the state 's excessive rights in fighting crime .
she has been fighting for the rights of the individual ever since . " unfortunately , these rights no longer have too many defenders in our liberal democracy , even though they represent for us the indispensable constitutional foundations , " she said . not only after terrorist plans are discovered or attacks carried out , but also before every state parliament election , it has become a matter of political ritual to make further demands for giving more authority to the police and intelligence agencies or for making penalties tougher .
the army , not to mention the country 's unemployed , should - according to some members of the government - get involved in the war on terror . i n efficie n t tools bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not efficient when it comes to war on terror but improvements are actually needed elsewhere . " we have many tools for fighting terrorism , " said klaus jansen , president of the german association of police investigators .
" but most of them are useless . "
problems lie in the area of cooperation and coordination . five years after sept .
11 , the bundling of competences and exchange of information has not been decisively pushed forward - that is the " curse " of the federal system .
seventeen agencies for the protection of the constitution still do not have a common database for investigating terror suspects because german federal states can not agree on what data should be shared .
an efficient federal police organization - similar to the fbi - is also missing . according to jansen , there are altogether 37 institutions in germany that are responsible for fighting terrorism .
the newly established common anti-terror center -lrb- gtaz -rrb- , which is supposed to pull all the strings together , has been fulfilling its role in a highly unsatisfactory manner .
internationally , this has been met with disbelief .
an efficient european - let alone transatlantic cooperation - in the fight against terror seems impossible if information can not flow even within germany itself . disbelief i n the usa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir al motassadeq ended up with a six-year sentence for belonging to a terrorist cell germany 's justice system is also not seen in a positive light abroad .
above all , from an american perspective , it seems slow , all too legalistic and mild as far as sentencing is concerned . applying the european arrest warrant has been , for instance , classified in germany as unconstitutional : one terror suspect sought after by spain had to be set free .
germany 's chief federal prosecutor at any rate pressed charges in 11 cases and achieved seven convictions against islamic terrorists .
most noteworthy was above all the process against members of the hamburg group , which were close to the attackers of sept .
11 . the washi n gto n post was not the only voice of doubt that " anybody will be sentenced here eventually " in this lengthy process .
mounir al motassadeq was in the end sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to more than 3,000 counts of murder and membership in a terrorist organization .
but the federal constitutional court annulled the sentence and the defendant got in the end a six-year sentence for his membership in the hamburg cell .
abdelghani mzoudi , who was on trial for the same charges , was acquitted . in 2004 , germany passed a new immigration law .
since then , it has become easier , for instance , to extradite extremist foreigners .
according to political scientist christoph butterwege , this is indicative of the way in which migration and security have become connected in the aftermath of sept .
11 . " the immigration debate got intertwined with discussions about terrorism and inner security , " said the author of " mass media , migration and integration . "
" that 's a dangerous combination . " i n tegratio n i n stead of exclusio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration of german muslims is a security concern since the attacks of sept .
11 , muslims have complained that they have been treated with general suspicion as if every religious muslim were a potential mass murderer .
debates about head scarves , honor killings and integration in germany - which partially bordered on hysteria - often overlooked the fact that experts see the composition of the muslim community in germany as one reason for the country 's relative safety : three quarters of the three million muslims in germany come from secular turkey and not , like they do in britain , mostly from pakistan or bangladesh , where fundamentalist islamic currents are much more influential . but exclusion because of generalized suspicion seems in the case of german muslims to be leading to a return to religion : a study by the center for turkish studies in essen has concluded that the importance of religion for germany 's immigrants has significantly increased since sept .
11 .
udo ulfkotte , an expert on terrorism , said he believes that avoiding a radicalization of the muslim community in germany must be a matter of priority for counter-terrorist policies . " we can not deal with terrorism only by installing addition 10,000 video cameras , " ulfkotte said .

" this is a meaningful moment for our entire country , and a good day for europe , " she said , accompanied by france 's european minister catherine colonna .
" more than six decades after its destruction in world war two , one of europe 's most meaningful vaults has returned to its original location . " the green vault - or g rünes gewölbe , as it is known to germans - was founded in 1723 by august ii , the prince-elector of saxony and little-loved king of poland who collected rare , glittering objects like johann melchior dinglinger 's 18th-century jewel-encrusted figurines titled " court of the grand moghul of delhi " and his " golden coffee set . " collecting instead of killing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxon electors found the shine of jewels more alluring than that of armor " with the long-awaited return of the saxon prince-electors ' and kings ' baroque vault to their first location has closed the worst wound in germany ' museum history , " said martin roth , the general director of dresden 's state art collections . the vault , named for the pale green hue of its domed ceiling , eventually housed more than 3,000 medieval , renaissance and early baroque works . " the house of saxony did not waste its time and money on wars , which it mostly lost anyway , but preferred to invest in great works of art , " georg milbradt , the premier of the eastern german state , told journalists on thursday . sparkle returns to lost treasures the green vault 's contents are the biggest surviving princely art collection in europe but languished in relative obscurity behind the iron curtain for decades .
the wealth of objects now back on display include an 18th century amber cabinet and theologian martin luther 's ring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors have been looking into the museum 's windows for the past few days the works are spread out in 10 connecting rooms bearing the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of and have been restored with photographs taken in 1933 used as a template . the rooms bear the names of the materials the objects they showcase are made of , such as ivory , white gold and amber , and culminate in the domed " precious room . "
while the museum 's walls are still marble , decorated with mirrors and gilt , the ceiling has not been painted green this time around . elaborate entrances its treasures escaped destruction in the allied fire-bombing of dresden in world war ii because they had been put into storage in a nearby fortress by the nazis . the collection was found by the red army before the end of the war and taken to moscow , from where it was only returned to dresden in 1958 and housed in dresden 's albertinum fine arts museum since 1974 . in order to be sure the collection retains its impressive gleam , only 100 visitors will be allowed into the museum at once and all will have to pass through " dust doors , " a type of airlock to keep out particles that could smudge the shine on the exhibitions ' jewels . in september 2004 , a part of the collection was moved into the so-called new green vault , on the first floor of the palace , which was finally restored after german reunification in 1990 , and attracted some 1.2 million visitors .

11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .

you bet ! after parking in downtown munich near the english garden , the first sign of surfing was a discarded wrapper from a stick of australian surfing wax .
just ahead , a couple of guys in black neoprene were jogging across the road , surf boards under their arms . ask any local in munich and they 'll tell you they 've got great beer and , with the highest annual number of sunny days in the country , they 're practically germany 's california . the absence of the pacific ocean and malibu beach is n't holding locals like rolf back from catching some waves . " when you compare it to the ocean , everything happens much faster because you have to do radical turns , like 180 degrees in a few seconds .
and the water comes out of the tunnel at five meters per hour , which is like 36 kilometers per hour , so it 's not too slow , " said ralf . the real thing - almost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's easy , anyone could have a go at it , " said ralf the tunnel ralf mentioned is on the eisbach , a tributary of the isar river that flows through the middle of munich .
as the waters of the eisbach emerge from an underground tunnel , they produce a small wave about 12 meters -lrb- 39 feet -rrb- wide with a clean face - almost as good as the real thing . only one person can surf at a time and , since it 's not possible to paddle upriver to the crest of the wave , regulars have worked out a number of ways to catch it , said rolf .
many sit on the riverbank , set their feet on the surfboard , stand up and slide down the face of the wave . others simply throw the board into the water and jump on . surfers come from near and far word on the eisbach wave has spread and it now attracts more than just the locals - like adam brown , an australian surfing instructor from the east coast surf mecca of byron bay . " it 's quite fast and there 's a hole in front of the wave , so it gives you the feeling of a much faster wave .
it 's got a lot of potential for a small wave , " said brown , who decided to check out the famed munich wave on a recent visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warning sign remains unheeded while surfing at eisbach may be fun for tourists and locals , it 's actually illegal .
not everyone seems to pay attention to the signs , though . no surfing allowed " we 've refrained from fines to far , but it there is a serious accident it 's going to become a problem , " said rainer herzog , garden director for the bavarian palace , garden and lake administration . nevertheless , on any given day at least a dozen surfers can be seen testing their skills on the eisbach wave .
and if you ask the right local , they might let you in on some other good surf spots nearby . in fact , surfing is popular enough that a munich company has started making producing special river boards . munich 's city river wave may not be up there with hawaii 's pipeline or bells beach in australia , but for many land-locked surfers in germany it 's the next best thing . guy degen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

11 changed the world germany 's solidarity with us waning after sept .
11 daily life has n't changed for americans since sept .

11 as a key event for online media großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 was a key event for online journalism the first images of sept.11 were seen on tv .
but those who wanted to find out more went online .
sept.11 stands for the breakthrough of the internet as a news medium and a platform for new forms of reporting . was the net going to break down ?
as soon as the first news of the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 in new york and washington , d.c. , made their rounds , the websites of large news providers experienced a previously unknown user invasion . whether cnn , bbc or dw-world.de , everybody had in a few hours more page hits than they would otherwise get in a whole week .
the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 were the first truly global event for which the public used not only television but also the internet as a major source of information .
at least in retrospect , sept .
11 can be seen as a " key event for the young news media of online journalism , " as the title of a study at the university of leipzig has suggested . this key event has left traces on the internet to this day .
you can still revisit the web pages from sept .
11 , 2001 at interactivepublishing.net.
the screenshots of news coverage from all over the world reflect the dramatic aspect of the unfolding events .
the burning towers of the world trade center and continuously updated texts dominated the initial reports .
but reporting in real time was just the beginning .
background information , timelines , picture galleries and videos soon complemented the picture of reality . letting users choose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eyewitnesses shared their experiences on the internet it turned out that the online media had something to offer that television and radio could not - users could namely choose what they wanted to read .
the need to know more about the unimaginable events in new york and washington , d.c. was better satisfied online , or , at least , that was what many users felt , even though the online editors were in no way better informed than their colleagues from radio or tv .
after all and despite the live coverage , there were still more questions than answers . on sept .
11 , this vacuum was quickly filled on the internet , if not necessarily by the established media .
while tv channels all over the world showed endless loops of oppressive images and while the webmasters of large online providers were getting new servers , first eyewitness accounts made it to the web .
new yorkers who were living in the proximity of the world trade center and who happened to be there , described what they saw , thought or simply felt .
calls for help and rumors started making rounds .
online forums developed into news platforms and virtual lists of condolences . the birth of civic journalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : september 11 marked the beginning of civic journalism this had always been the case with the internet .
but only in the exceptional situation of sept .
11 did these private and often journal-like pages find for the first time their larger even worldwide audience , becoming themselves a topic for reporters to cover .
ever since then , there has been talk about civic journalism beyond cnn.com & co .
the concept of a " weblog " or " blog " stands for this type of internet publishing , which emerges outside the framework of a media company and remains , above all , subjective .
that is what is so stimulating about it , but also what makes it vulnerable .
after all , the internet also offers a platform for numerous sept.11 conspiracy theorists . nowadays , more than a billion people have internet access .
with sept .
11 at the latest , the world wide web established itself as a mass medium for news and information .
but sept .
11 also marked the point at which users of this medium also became active .
some journalist may see in this a lamentable loss of their power , but people have already decided that they want both . holger hank -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : everyone 's interested in the net - especially dictators the internet allows people to write and read what anyone in the world has to say - theoretically .
the truth is that the enemies of the internet keep it under control , says julien pain of reporters without borders .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- germany plans tough measures for stopping terror on the web since the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , the number of internet sites promoting violent jihad have soared .
germany wants to crack down on such sites and will change the law to do it .

you bet ! after parking in downtown munich near the english garden , the first sign of surfing was a discarded wrapper from a stick of australian surfing wax .
just ahead , a couple of guys in black neoprene were jogging across the road , surf boards under their arms . ask any local in munich and they 'll tell you they 've got great beer and , with the highest annual number of sunny days in the country , they 're practically germany 's california . the absence of the pacific ocean and malibu beach is n't holding locals like rolf back from catching some waves . " when you compare it to the ocean , everything happens much faster because you have to do radical turns , like 180 degrees in a few seconds .
and the water comes out of the tunnel at five meters per hour , which is like 36 kilometers per hour , so it 's not too slow , " said ralf . the real thing - almost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's easy , anyone could have a go at it , " said ralf the tunnel ralf mentioned is on the eisbach , a tributary of the isar river that flows through the middle of munich .
as the waters of the eisbach emerge from an underground tunnel , they produce a small wave about 12 meters -lrb- 39 feet -rrb- wide with a clean face - almost as good as the real thing . only one person can surf at a time and , since it 's not possible to paddle upriver to the crest of the wave , regulars have worked out a number of ways to catch it , said rolf .
many sit on the riverbank , set their feet on the surfboard , stand up and slide down the face of the wave . others simply throw the board into the water and jump on . surfers come from near and far word on the eisbach wave has spread and it now attracts more than just the locals - like adam brown , an australian surfing instructor from the east coast surf mecca of byron bay . " it 's quite fast and there 's a hole in front of the wave , so it gives you the feeling of a much faster wave .
it 's got a lot of potential for a small wave , " said brown , who decided to check out the famed munich wave on a recent visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warning sign remains unheeded while surfing at eisbach may be fun for tourists and locals , it 's actually illegal .
not everyone seems to pay attention to the signs , though . no surfing allowed " we 've refrained from fines to far , but it there is a serious accident it 's going to become a problem , " said rainer herzog , garden director for the bavarian palace , garden and lake administration . nevertheless , on any given day at least a dozen surfers can be seen testing their skills on the eisbach wave .
and if you ask the right local , they might let you in on some other good surf spots nearby . in fact , surfing is popular enough that a munich company has started making producing special river boards . munich 's city river wave may not be up there with hawaii 's pipeline or bells beach in australia , but for many land-locked surfers in germany it 's the next best thing . guy degen -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a river runs through it river-faring vessels have access to more than 7,000 kilometers -lrb- 4,350 miles -rrb- of inland waterways in germany .

twenty-five-year-old heidi king is one of the first british patients to try it .
heidi is the life and soul of any party .
intelligent and vivacious , she has a wide circle of friends .
she loves to socialise and is a keen tango dancer .
but when heidi opens her mouth to speak , her voice instantly commands the attention of everyone in the room .
a few simple sentences can take severe stammerer heidi an age to get out .
it 's painful to listen to and exhausting for her .
she 's no victim though and she does n't want pity .
in fact the only time her smile fades is if you try to finish off her sentences .
heidi began stammering around the age of three .
growing up in billericay in essex , she had all the therapies , none really worked . "
it will change the way i communicate " heidi 's diary but she has n't let it hold her back - her outgoing personality is testament to that - so too is a first class honours degree in psychology from the university of kent .
she has a good job too - working on an older carers project for age concern in norwich .
despite not seeing her severe stammer as an impediment , heidi volunteered for the pioneering treatment in america .
she is one of the first britons to try it .
she says : " i suppose deep down i would love a cure or something which helps my stammer . "
the treatment is not available on the nhs and costs over £ 5,000 , and there are no guarantees it will even work .
the ' choral effect ' her speech therapist mary kingston says it will not be a miracle cure .
" i do n't think we should look at it as a cure .
" it is much more like a pair of glasses .
it will hopefully ease it .
that is what we are both hoping for . "
heidi travelled to america where she was fitted with the electronic implant called speecheasy .
it looks like an advanced hearing aid .
like most stammerers , heidi can sing in unison without stuttering .
the implant mimics that " choral effect " by sending out an echo of heidi 's voice .
it tricks her brain into thinking she is talking along with someone else and unblocks the impediment .
heidi 's initial response was very promising .
for an hour she talked fluently - practising reading pages of text ; recounting the days of the week , the months of the year .
" i do n't feel like heidi because i am not stammering , " she said .
" it is almost as if i am detached .
that is a strange person speaking , it is n't me .
" i feel as if i am on a drug because it is making me so relaxed .
i am listening to a little man in my ear .
i am just not struggling as much .
it is just so strange to speak without stammering . "
emotional adjustments it 's not a total cure , says speech pathologist john haskell who treated her in new york .
" heidi is starting to hear herself differently .
she heard her voice with a slight delay and with a higher pitch speaking with her .
she will have to expect moments of stuttering or blocks , but she is going to learn to deal with it .
people around her will have to expect that she is not going to be 100 % . "
there have been emotional adjustments to make too .
heidi admits she 's scared of using the device .
" it will change the way i communicate .
it is almost like i have lost my control . "
" now i am more self-conscious .
today it is almost like i am a different person .
i know i am not .
" i am trying to listen to the little man in my ear .
it is quite hard .
" i go through life and i do n't ever have to think about my speech .
now i am having to concentrate .
" it has been a long journey .
i am still on that journey .
it seems too much now .
too scary to look at what i can do with it .
it 's still me , whether i stammer or not . "

twenty-five-year-old heidi king is one of the first british patients to try it .
heidi is the life and soul of any party .
intelligent and vivacious , she has a wide circle of friends .
she loves to socialise and is a keen tango dancer .
but when heidi opens her mouth to speak , her voice instantly commands the attention of everyone in the room .
a few simple sentences can take severe stammerer heidi an age to get out .
it 's painful to listen to and exhausting for her .
she 's no victim though and she does n't want pity .
in fact the only time her smile fades is if you try to finish off her sentences .
heidi began stammering around the age of three .
growing up in billericay in essex , she had all the therapies , none really worked .
it will change the way i communicate heidi 's diary but she has n't let it hold her back - her outgoing personality is testament to that - so too is a first class honours degree in psychology from the university of kent .
she has a good job too - working on an older carers project for age concern in norwich .
despite not seeing her severe stammer as an impediment , heidi volunteered for the pioneering treatment in america .
she is one of the first britons to try it .
she says : " i suppose deep down i would love a cure or something which helps my stammer . "
the treatment is not available on the nhs and costs over £ 5,000 , and there are no guarantees it will even work .
the ' choral effect ' her speech therapist mary kingston says it will not be a miracle cure .
" i do n't think we should look at it as a cure .
" it is much more like a pair of glasses .
it will hopefully ease it .
that is what we are both hoping for . "
heidi travelled to america where she was fitted with the electronic implant called speecheasy .
it looks like an advanced hearing aid .
gareth gates is a famous example of someone whose stammer stops when he sings like most stammerers , heidi can sing in unison without stuttering .
the implant mimics that " choral effect " by sending out an echo of heidi 's voice .
it tricks her brain into thinking she is talking along with someone else and unblocks the impediment .
heidi 's initial response was very promising .
for an hour she talked fluently - practising reading pages of text ; recounting the days of the week , the months of the year .
" i do n't feel like heidi because i am not stammering , " she said .
" it is almost as if i am detached .
that is a strange person speaking , it is n't me .
" i feel as if i am on a drug because it is making me so relaxed .
i am listening to a little man in my ear .
i am just not struggling as much .
it is just so strange to speak without stammering . "
emotional adjustments it 's not a total cure , says speech pathologist john haskell who treated her in new york .
" heidi is starting to hear herself differently .
she heard her voice with a slight delay and with a higher pitch speaking with her .
she will have to expect moments of stuttering or blocks , but she is going to learn to deal with it .
people around her will have to expect that she is not going to be 100 % . "
there have been emotional adjustments to make too .
heidi admits she 's scared of using the device .
" it will change the way i communicate .
it is almost like i have lost my control . "
" now i am more self-conscious .
today it is almost like i am a different person .
i know i am not .
" i am trying to listen to the little man in my ear .
it is quite hard .
" i go through life and i do n't ever have to think about my speech .
now i am having to concentrate .
" it has been a long journey .
i am still on that journey .
it seems too much now .
too scary to look at what i can do with it .
it 's still me , whether i stammer or not . "

a team in vietnam compared people infected with the different flus .
the nature medicine research found that the bird flu virus triggers a massive inflammatory response , which often proved fatal .
a uk expert said the study provided vital information about how best to treat people infected with the virus .
there have been 241 cases of people being infected with h5n1 since the outbreak started in 2003 .
over half died from the disease .
the team from the oxford university clinical research unit at the hospital for tropical diseases in ho chi minh city , vietnam , looked at 18 people who had had h5n1 and eight who had had normal human flu .
they looked at the level of the viral load - the concentration of the relevant virus in a person 's blood , and at how the person 's immune system had responded to infection .
blood cells it was found that the patients infected with h5n1 had much higher viral loads in the throat than those patients infected with the human flu virus .
and the markers of viral load were highest in the h5n1 patients who had died .
virus could also frequently be detected in the blood of h5n1 patients , but only in those who died .
the researchers noted that the presence of high levels of h5n1 virus triggered a release of proteins called cytokines which should control a body 's response to infection .
the highest levels of cytokines were seen in those with the highest viral loads- who were those who had died .
in these cases there was also an associated loss of lymphocytes -lrb- types of white blood cell -rrb- in the peripheral blood .
the team suggests it is these factors which lead to lung damage and , on many occasions , death .
dr menno de jong and his colleagues wrote in nature medicine : " the focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response , by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment . "
professor john oxford , a virus expert based at barts and the london nhs trust in the uk , said : " this clearly puts the emphasis on the level of virus a person has .
" the higher it is , the higher the chance of death . "
he said it showed people infected with h5n1 should be treated with antiviral drugs - tamiflu , relenza or amantadine - in order to reduce the amount of virus in their systems .
professor oxford said the information would also help if the virus mixed with a human flu and mutated into a form which was easily transmitted between people .
he added : " we are lucky this is happening now .
if it had been the 1970s or 80s , we would not have had these antiviral drugs to turn to . "

a team in vietnam compared people infected with the different flus .
the nature medicine research found that the bird flu virus triggers a massive inflammatory response , which often proved fatal .
a uk expert said the study provided vital information about how best to treat people infected with the virus .
there have been 241 cases of people being infected with h5n1 since the outbreak started in 2003 .
over half died from the disease .
the team from the oxford university clinical research unit at the hospital for tropical diseases in ho chi minh city , vietnam , looked at 18 people who had had h5n1 and eight who had had normal human flu .
they looked at the level of the viral load - the concentration of the relevant virus in a person 's blood , and at how the person 's immune system had responded to infection .
blood cells it was found that the patients infected with h5n1 had much higher viral loads in the throat than those patients infected with the human flu virus .
and the markers of viral load were highest in the h5n1 patients who had died .
virus could also frequently be detected in the blood of h5n1 patients , but only in those who died .
the researchers noted that the presence of high levels of h5n1 virus triggered a release of proteins called cytokines which should control a body 's response to infection .
the highest levels of cytokines were seen in those with the highest viral loads- who were those who had died .
in these cases there was also an associated loss of lymphocytes -lrb- types of white blood cell -rrb- in the peripheral blood .
the team suggests it is these factors which lead to lung damage and , on many occasions , death .
dr menno de jong and his colleagues wrote in nature medicine : " the focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response , by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment . "
professor john oxford , a virus expert based at barts and the london nhs trust in the uk , said : " this clearly puts the emphasis on the level of virus a person has .
" the higher it is , the higher the chance of death . "
he said it showed people infected with h5n1 should be treated with antiviral drugs - tamiflu , relenza or amantadine - in order to reduce the amount of virus in their systems .
professor oxford said the information would also help if the virus mixed with a human flu and mutated into a form which was easily transmitted between people .
he added : " we are lucky this is happening now .
if it had been the 1970s or 80s , we would not have had these antiviral drugs to turn to . "

japan began its intelligence-gathering satellite programme following north korea 's test launch of a long-range missile that flew over japan in 1998 .
this launch follows a series of missile tests by pyongyang in july , which included a new weapon , the taepodong-2 , which is potentially capable of hitting parts of the united states .

" this plan is to ensure safety and defend ourselves from foreign countries , " an official from the cabinet office 's satellite intelligence office told the french news agency afp .
" but it will also be used generally for grand-scale catastrophes and is not directly linked to the specific issue of north korea and its missile launches , " he added .

eight corpses have been found on either side of the polden hills - six of them were discovered in just one month .
somerset wildlife trust is not certain if the deaths are linked to a parasite which is known to affect otters .
spokesman james williams said : " it is extremely worrying and unusual because this is the time of year when we do n't get much trouble from dead otters . "
report deaths he added : " we get a steady trickle of otter deaths scattered all over the county - a fluctuating amount , with july normally being a very low month .
we do n't know why it 's happening . "
the marked increase in deaths in somerset comes at a time when the species is under increasing pressure , said mr williams .
the creatures are vulnerable to a fluke , believed to have come from eastern european ornamental fish released into the county 's watercourses .
the parasite does not kill the otters , but causes liver disease and jaundice , which weakens them .
the trust is encouraging people to report deaths of otters - and mink , which carry the same parasite - so that corpses can be examined .

eight corpses have been found on either side of the polden hills - six of them were discovered in just one month .
somerset wildlife trust is not certain if the deaths are linked to a parasite which is known to affect otters .
spokesman james williams said : " it is extremely worrying and unusual because this is the time of year when we do n't get much trouble from dead otters . "
report deaths he added : " we get a steady trickle of otter deaths scattered all over the county - a fluctuating amount , with july normally being a very low month .
we do n't know why it 's happening . "
the marked increase in deaths in somerset comes at a time when the species is under increasing pressure , said mr williams .
the creatures are vulnerable to a fluke , believed to have come from eastern european ornamental fish released into the county 's watercourses .
the parasite does not kill the otters , but causes liver disease and jaundice , which weakens them .
the trust is encouraging people to report deaths of otters - and mink , which carry the same parasite - so that corpses can be examined .

but one of london 's oldest pubs - the intrepid fox in soho - is facing closure , inspiring 5,000 people to back a campaign to save it .
bbc news explores its colourful past .
these days those seeking a night of rock and alternative music are the ones most likely to be seen flocking to the intrepid fox , in soho 's wardour street .
motorhead 's singer lemmy and ex-sex pistols manager malcolm maclaren have been known to drink there .
it is even said to be the place where mick jagger talked ronnie wood in to joining the stones .
but the fox , which dates back to 1784 , has its roots in somewhat loftier reaches .
it was originally named after charles james fox by its first owner , samuel house .
its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene patrick begent , pub manager but it now faces being turned into trendy apartments .
this is a real blow , according to manager patrick begent , who has been running the establishment for 15 years .
" i was given a week 's notice to vacate the place with the understanding that a property developer has purchased the building , " he said .
" it 's devastating .
the fox is an integral part of the alternative music scene in london and one of the few remaining . "
recounting its history , mr begent said that during an election campaign for charles james fox , original owner mr house was not averse to promoting his friend 's cause .
" according to a story , during an election campaign mr house had offered anybody who walked into the tavern a free drink and a kiss from the duchess of devonshire , if they voted for mr fox , " he said .
the pub had a reputation as a haven of goth culture " the pub has also witnessed music history in the making .
apparently , rock star mick jagger convinced ronnie wood to join the rolling stones in this pub . "
in a bid to retain the watering hole , robin canon , a regular for the past two years , has launched a petition to save the pub .
he gathered 5,000 signatures in nine days .
" this pub has character and it makes you feel welcome , whatever your appearance , " he said .
" its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene and loss of cultural diversity , which is important to london 's development . "
according to its former owners , mitchells & butlers , it is just one in a package of 21 pubs across the city that were sold last month for £ 53m .
but the " spirit of the fox will live on " , said mr begent , who plans to relocate the pub to another venue .
" we 'll ensure the fox survives the hunt . "

but one of london 's oldest pubs - the intrepid fox in soho - is facing closure , inspiring 5,000 people to back a campaign to save it .
bbc news explores its colourful past .
these days those seeking a night of rock and alternative music are the ones most likely to be seen flocking to the intrepid fox , in soho 's wardour street .
motorhead 's singer lemmy and ex-sex pistols manager malcolm maclaren have been known to drink there .
it is even said to be the place where mick jagger talked ronnie wood in to joining the stones .
but the fox , which dates back to 1784 , has its roots in somewhat loftier reaches .
it was originally named after charles james fox by its first owner , samuel house .
its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene patrick begent , pub manager but it now faces being turned into trendy apartments .
this is a real blow , according to manager patrick begent , who has been running the establishment for 15 years .
" i was given a week 's notice to vacate the place with the understanding that a property developer has purchased the building , " he said .
" it 's devastating .
the fox is an integral part of the alternative music scene in london and one of the few remaining . "
recounting its history , mr begent said that during an election campaign for charles james fox , original owner mr house was not averse to promoting his friend 's cause .
" according to a story , during an election campaign mr house had offered anybody who walked into the tavern a free drink and a kiss from the duchess of devonshire , if they voted for mr fox , " he said .

in a bid to retain the watering hole , robin canon , a regular for the past two years , has launched a petition to save the pub .
he gathered 5,000 signatures in nine days .
" this pub has character and it makes you feel welcome , whatever your appearance , " he said .
" its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene and loss of cultural diversity , which is important to london 's development . "

these days those seeking a night of rock and alternative music are the ones most likely to be seen flocking to the intrepid fox , in soho 's wardour street .
motorhead 's singer lemmy and ex-sex pistols manager malcolm maclaren have been known to drink there .
it is even said to be the place where mick jagger talked ronnie wood in to joining the stones .
but the fox , which dates back to 1784 , has its roots in somewhat loftier reaches .
it was originally named after charles james fox by its first owner , samuel house .
its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene patrick begent , pub manager but it now faces being turned into trendy apartments .
this is a real blow , according to manager patrick begent , who has been running the establishment for 15 years .
" i was given a week 's notice to vacate the place with the understanding that a property developer has purchased the building , " he said .
" it 's devastating .
the fox is an integral part of the alternative music scene in london and one of the few remaining . "
recounting its history , mr begent said that during an election campaign for charles james fox , original owner mr house was not averse to promoting his friend 's cause .
" according to a story , during an election campaign mr house had offered anybody who walked into the tavern a free drink and a kiss from the duchess of devonshire , if they voted for mr fox , " he said .
the pub had a reputation as a haven of goth culture " the pub has also witnessed music history in the making .
apparently , rock star mick jagger convinced ronnie wood to join the rolling stones in this pub . "
in a bid to retain the watering hole , robin canon , a regular for the past two years , has launched a petition to save the pub .
he gathered 5,000 signatures in nine days .
" this pub has character and it makes you feel welcome , whatever your appearance , " he said .
" its closure will mean sanitisation of the city 's pub scene and loss of cultural diversity , which is important to london 's development . "
according to its former owners , mitchells & butlers , it is just one in a package of 21 pubs across the city that were sold last month for £ 53m .
but the " spirit of the fox will live on " , said mr begent , who plans to relocate the pub to another venue .
" we 'll ensure the fox survives the hunt . "

such findings may come as little surprise to the workers hired to clean the dust and debris from the buildings surrounding ground zero .
one such was 54-year-old volodymyr khomik .
a lawyer in his native ukraine , he was forced to take a manual labour job when he arrived in the us because of his lack of english language skills .
his employer joined the clean-up operation at ground zero on 12 september , 2001 and that afternoon volodymyr set to work there .
" the first few days were emotionally devastating , " he says , bowing and shaking his head .
" there were so many things going on at the time , there was fire and body parts all over the place .
" it was extremely difficult for us to work there during the first few days and weeks because we were not prepared for this kind of job . "
' suffocating ' the work was physically very demanding , often 16 hours a day , seven days a week for the first three months .
conditions on the site were extremely difficult , says mr khomik .
" we had to work with our bare hands and we did not have the right equipment , right masks and nobody cared at that time .
" there were places in ground zero where we could not breathe at all , we were suffocating and we could n't hold our breath .
so we had to wait for some time until the smoke went away . "
he says it took a serious toll on his health , evident from the wheezing cough and the difficulty he has catching his breath .
" after two or three months working there , i started to have health problems and the situation just got worse and worse . "
a cat scan in 2002 showed dust in his lungs .
" my doctor asked me why i had been smoking so much , " says mr khomik .
" when i told him that i was working at ground zero he stopped asking questions .
" i have problems breathing now .
i was also diagnosed with heart problems and my blood circulation is not working properly . "
future fears unable to work since 2002 , and without insurance , the ukrainian faces hefty medical bills and fears he has become a burden on his family . "
i believe that more workers will actually die from the effects of the toxic substances that they were cleaning up than people who were actually killed on 9/11 " lawyer gregory cannata his vision of the future is bleak .
" i am like an old man now .
i do n't know what will happen to me ...
i am thinking about whether i will live or pass away , it is the number one question for me now . "
lawyer gregory cannata says the scale of the health problems linked to 9/11 is enormous .
thousands of people - firemen , policemen , residents and clean-up workers , both illegal and legal - have begun legal action , notably a class-action lawsuit against the environmental protection agency .
volodymyr is among a number who are suing the owners of the buildings they were employed to clean up , on the grounds that workers were not provided with adequate protective equipment on the premises .
mr cannata , who is acting for 60 workers , thinks there are still more lawsuits to come .
" we 're talking about tens of thousands of workers .
thousands of them are ill and thousands of them are becoming ill , " he says .
" i believe that more workers will actually die from the effects of the toxic substances that they were cleaning up than people who were actually killed on 9/11 . "
constant medication the dust that was left behind after the twin towers collapsed contained small particles of substances such as asbestos , lead , glass , and cement .
breathing this in left people vulnerable to lung injuries .
many started with a chronic cough , referred to at the time as ' world trade center cough ' .
others developed obstructive lung disease , nodules in their lungs , and scar tissue which all make it more difficult for the lungs to get oxygen into the bloodstream .
and as the lungs become more damaged , the knock-on effect has been circulation and heart problems .
some of the workers have developed cancers , although it is yet to be proven that these are related .
a study by the mount sinai medical center , based on the screening of 9,500 rescue and clean-up workers - the largest programme of its kind - said nearly 70 % have had trouble breathing and many are likely to be affected for the rest of their lives .
" these were people who had been gainfully employed all their lives and now ca n't work and they 're sick , " says mr cannata .
" they are taking numerous medications - they are disabled as a result of this , they ca n't breathe , they ca n't catch their breath , they are constantly coughing - they 're very uncomfortable and it 's really destroyed and crippled their lives . "

" i believe that more workers will actually die from the effects of the toxic substances that they were cleaning up than people who were actually killed on 9/11 . "
constant medication the dust that was left behind after the twin towers collapsed contained small particles of substances such as asbestos , lead , glass , and cement .
breathing this in left people vulnerable to lung injuries .
many started with a chronic cough , referred to at the time as ' world trade center cough ' .
smoke and dust lingered over manhattan for days after the attack others developed obstructive lung disease , nodules in their lungs , and scar tissue which all make it more difficult for the lungs to get oxygen into the bloodstream .
and as the lungs become more damaged , the knock-on effect has been circulation and heart problems .
some of the workers have developed cancers , although it is yet to be proven that these are related .
a study by the mount sinai medical center , based on the screening of 9,500 rescue and clean-up workers - the largest programme of its kind - said nearly 70 % have had trouble breathing and many are likely to be affected for the rest of their lives .
" these were people who had been gainfully employed all their lives and now ca n't work and they 're sick , " says mr cannata .
" they are taking numerous medications - they are disabled as a result of this , they ca n't breathe , they ca n't catch their breath , they are constantly coughing - they 're very uncomfortable and it 's really destroyed and crippled their lives . "

by nick hawton bbc news , podgorica as his supporters cheered and waved red and gold montenegro flags , milo djukanovic smiled confidently and strode to the platform .
the great survivor of balkan politics was making another victory speech , congratulating his supporters and promising a brighter future .
" this is not just a victory , it is a triumph , " he told the hundreds who had crammed themselves into a hall in the main government building in podgorica .
many seemed in a trance of admiration for their great leader .
" this election proves that montenegro is politically very stable and on the european track , " he added .
outside , young men raced their cars along the capital 's tree-lined boulevards , hanging out of the windows and sounding their horns .
it is a sign of mr djukanovic 's supreme confidence that he was declaring " absolute victory " before any official results had actually been announced .
but perhaps such confidence can be forgiven after 15 years of uninterrupted power , serving as either prime minister or president the entire time .
after all , this was just another election victory - apparently .
amicable divorce but this was something special - the first general election in an independent montenegro after it broke away from its union with serbia earlier this year. it was the icing on the cake for mr djukanovic who had championed the independence cause . "
i did n't care about independence and i do n't care about this election " a montenegrin citizen the main serbian opposition parties , who had opposed independence in the first place , were left licking their wounds after what appears to be their second mauling in less than five months .
the only apparent change on the political landscape is the emergence of a think-tank turned political party called the movement for change which has only been going a few months but achieved around 15 % of the vote .
led by the charismatic nebojsa medojevic , it has campaigned on policies of tackling corruption and reforming the political system .
a force for the future , perhaps .
and so what of the future ?
montenegro is now truly on its own since its amicable divorce with serbia .
there is no more hiding behind the coattails of big brother serbia and all the dodgy political baggage that comes with .
it now has to try to charter the waters towards the european union membership and international respectability .
developing tourism and continuing the privatisation process are likely to be central features of economic policy .
negative views but montenegro is a small country with a population of less than 700,000 and a political and economic elite that has dominated the country for the best part of two decades .
the opposition feels alienated and the allegations of corruption against that embedded elite remain strong .
" i did n't care about independence and i do n't care about this election , " said one man to me in podgorica 's main square on election day .
" i just do n't believe in our politicians , what they do or the system they run .
i just prefer to get on with my own life . "
such negative views can not be welcomed by any of montenegro 's political figures .
milo djukanovic has helped guide montenegro through a traumatic period in modern balkan history , avoiding much of the horror and devastation that has visited other republics of the former yugoslavia .
but now comes the real test .
can montenegro make it on its own ?

over 1,000 body parts were plundered by gangs in new york and then sold for transplants , it has been claimed .
biomedical tissue services , the firm at the centre of the scandal , exported 77 body parts to the uk last year .
nhs regulator , the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency , said it had alerted 20 nhs trusts . "
we would say any risk is minimum and this is just a precautionary measure " mhra spokeswoman late last year , the us food and drug administration ordered a recall of the potentially tainted products and warned that many patients could have been exposed to hiv and other diseases , but insisted the risk of infection was minimal .
new york investigators say death certificates were doctored to make the dead out to have been younger and healthier than they actually were .
the tissue , in the form of skin , bone and tendons , was later sold for use in procedures like dental implants and hip replacements .
four people have pleaded not guilty to the charges .
the body of veteran bbc broadcaster alistair cooke , who died of cancer aged 95 in march 2004 , was reported to have been caught up in the case .
infected a spokeswoman for the mhra said : " it 's not to say that the 77 body parts that were brought in came from stolen cadavers or were infected .
" but they did come from biomedical tissue services and we alerted hospitals of this earlier in the year . "
she added it was up to individual doctors to decide what to do in regards to removing the implants or deciding it was less risk to leave them in .
the body parts were all pieces of bone which were grafted on to patients needing hip or jaw operations .
the mhra would not say exactly where in the uk the imported parts were sent because the procedures were unusual enough that the patients involved could be identified .
and the spokeswoman added : " we would say any risk is minimum and this is just a precautionary measure . "
