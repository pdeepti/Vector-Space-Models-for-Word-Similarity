the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either . " of course , one of the effects of this conference is that our society takes more note of the fact that muslims are part of this society , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish center in germany has high hopes for islam summit the center for turkish studies in essen sees the upcoming islam summit as an opportunity to improve the religion 's standing in germany .

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either . " of course , one of the effects of this conference is that our society takes more note of the fact that muslims are part of this society , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish center in germany has high hopes for islam summit the center for turkish studies in essen sees the upcoming islam summit as an opportunity to improve the religion 's standing in germany .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.09.2006 political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddha , mohammed , poseidon and jesus all appear in the opera a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .
the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

" now we need to crank it up , " said former porto midfielder deco , who has won the title twice in the past three seasons .
" we want to win in bremen like we did last year and that would be a great start to the champions league defense . " while barcelona already have the comfort of three points on the board , bremen have yet to register after losing their opening fixture 2-0 to chelsea . defeat to spanish champions barcelona would leave bremen with a mountain to climb to qualify for the knockout stage with frank rijkaard 's team and chelsea already having a head start . bremen 's strike force struggling for fitness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose may be risked despite injury the fitness of german international attacker miroslav klose , the golden boot winner at the world cup , is crucial for bremen and they are praying he is fit for barcelona after missing the last two league matches with an ankle injury . " first our defense was the topic of debate , now it is our attack , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . the goals have dried up for werder with croat marksman ivan klasnic and klose injured and schaaf may gamble on the latter . " it is possible that he -lrb- klose -rrb- could play , " schaaf said . bremen are also without brazilian playmaker diego who injured his knee in saturday 's 1-1 draw with hamburg . bremen 's suspect defense will certainly be tested by brazilian maestro ronaldinho and cameroon star samuel eto 'o , with the intelligent deco supplying the ammunition , but bremen 's german international tim borowksi is not afraid . " we need to have more confidence in ourselves against barcelona , " borowski said .
" we must go in with no fear . " if bremen 's players want to achieve that they would be well advised not to watch the tape of barcelona 's 4-0 drubbing of their league rivals bayern munich in a recent friendly match . bayern look to build on moscow win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern thrashed spartak 4-0 in their opening game bayern themselves will face a tough time in milan against an inter side fielding a rejuvenated and in-form hernan crespo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2006 opinion : beware the slippery slope ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worried about possible islamic hostility , the deutsche oper wiped its rendition of mozart 's " idomeneo " from its current season .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

what is an rss feed ?
rss is the abbreviation for really simple syndication .
files created in rss format are usually called feeds .

at its simplest , a feed is like a web page that is readable by computers instead of humans since it does not contain any design or graphic details .
bloggers are largely responsible for making rss feeds popular . what can i do with rss ?
rss makes it possible for you to subscribe web sites content - or the parts of a web site - and get all of the site 's most recent stories automatically delivered to you .
when you subscribe to an rss feed , you make sure you get the most up-to-date information - whether it 's text , audio or video . what technical requirements do i have to meet to use rss ?
you need an rss reader before you can subscribe to an rss feed .
the reader , also sometimes called a news reader , is what checks your subscriptions for the newest items .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either .

the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2006 opinion : beware the slippery slope ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worried about possible islamic hostility , the deutsche oper wiped its rendition of mozart 's " idomeneo " from its current season .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .

" now we need to crank it up , " said former porto midfielder deco , who has won the title twice in the past three seasons .
" we want to win in bremen like we did last year and that would be a great start to the champions league defense . " while barcelona already have the comfort of three points on the board , bremen have yet to register after losing their opening fixture 2-0 to chelsea . defeat to spanish champions barcelona would leave bremen with a mountain to climb to qualify for the knockout stage with frank rijkaard 's team and chelsea already having a head start . bremen 's strike force struggling for fitness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose may be risked despite injury the fitness of german international attacker miroslav klose , the golden boot winner at the world cup , is crucial for bremen and they are praying he is fit for barcelona after missing the last two league matches with an ankle injury . " first our defense was the topic of debate , now it is our attack , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . the goals have dried up for werder with croat marksman ivan klasnic and klose injured and schaaf may gamble on the latter . " it is possible that he -lrb- klose -rrb- could play , " schaaf said . bremen are also without brazilian playmaker diego who injured his knee in saturday 's 1-1 draw with hamburg . bremen 's suspect defense will certainly be tested by brazilian maestro ronaldinho and cameroon star samuel eto 'o , with the intelligent deco supplying the ammunition , but bremen 's german international tim borowksi is not afraid . " we need to have more confidence in ourselves against barcelona , " borowski said .
" we must go in with no fear . " if bremen 's players want to achieve that they would be well advised not to watch the tape of barcelona 's 4-0 drubbing of their league rivals bayern munich in a recent friendly match . bayern look to build on moscow win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern thrashed spartak 4-0 in their opening game bayern themselves will face a tough time in milan against an inter side fielding a rejuvenated and in-form hernan crespo . " at the moment things are going well for me and , most of all , for inter , " crespo told inter 's website .
" -lrb- the bayern game -rrb- will be hard match , but a nice one to play in . " bayern general manager uli hoeness said inter were strong favorites to win the tie . " they 're a class above us this season , " he said . podolski out of form ; hargreaves injured lukas podolski , the pin-up boy of german football who has failed to score a league goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne , is expected to start on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has n't replicated his cologne form at bayern the german international , whose stock rose dramatically after his impressive world cup performances , was dropped for saturday 's match at alemannia aachen , which bayern won 2-1 . however , despite his poor form , the determined 21-year-old believes he will soon start hitting the net . " things are not going how i thought they would , " podolski said .
" of course i am disappointed not to be playing .
it irritates me - otherwise i would not be a real footballer .
but my time will come and i will score my goals here .
i am not gripped by fear of failing at bayern . " bayern 's most notable absentee will be owen hargreaves .
the england midfielder suffered a fractured left leg earlier this month and is unlikely to return for several weeks . bayern , who like inter are top of their domestic league , began their champions league campaign with a 4-0 win over spartak moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed fortunes for german clubs in champions league draw bayern munich will be quietly confident , sv hamburg will fancy their chances as an underdog , and werder bremen will be cursing their luck after the european champions league draw .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .

the government wants the talks to result in a contract between the two sides that will improve integration in germany and quell the growing influence of islamist extremists . the meeting was overshadowed by controversy about a berlin opera house that cancelled a production showing decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed and jesus .
the deutsche oper said it had been worried it might be attacked by muslim extremists . schäuble said the meeting 's participants had all told him the controversial production of mozart 's " idomeneo " should go ahead . " we want this production to be performed as soon as possible , " he said , adding that they would then go together to watch it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble and ayyub köhler , one of the muslim leaders his talks with the german muslim community were " not always harmonious " but proceeded " in a tolerant tone , " schäuble said .
there was disagreement over the questions of who were appropriate representatives of the muslim community , women 's rights and whether girls should be allowed to take part in school swimming lessons , but the participants had gotten along , he added . " it will be difficult and it will be a lot of work , " schäuble said of the talks , which are to be resumed by three working groups on values , religious questions as well as business and the media on nov .

an additional group will discuss questions of domestic security and preventing islamist violence .
regulating relations badr mohammed , a secular turkish leader who heads the european integration center in berlin , said the meeting had the nearly three-hour meeting had been " a historic breakthrough in the intercultural opening of society . " the leaders of islamic religious groups who took part were more cautious in welcoming the talks , but stressed their devotion to germany 's democratic constitution . the ditib , which is associated with turkey 's religious affairs ministry , said it and three other national islamic associations in germany had agreed to work more closely with one another in future .
bildunterschrift : the talks took place in charlottenburg palace this is the first time federal authorities have ever launched a dialogue with the country 's muslim minority .
muslims make up more than 4 percent of germany 's 82-million-strong population .
they are not only divided into secular and religious camps , but also by country of origin and theological differences . the government has been calling for all muslims in germany to adopt the german language , affirm their support for democracy and help catch violent islamists .
some muslim leaders hope their faith can win equal treatment to that given in germany to christian churches .
germany 's jewish community has also negotiated an agreement with the government regulating their relations . religious groups complained before the meeting that they were only allocated five of the 15 muslim seats at the table , with the rest distributed among secular and other groups . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens dialogue with country 's muslim community germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners .

" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .
however , it is also expected to call for a separate area for smokers even in restaurants of this size . these recommendations precisely correspond to those put forward by the german federation of the cigarette industry -lrb- vdc -rrb- . coalition accused of profit before health bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staff in restaurants are at risk from passive smoking bärbel höhn , acting leader of the green party 's parliamentary faction , accused the coalition of " kneeling before the tobacco lobby " and told the süddeutsche zeitung that " it is obvious the health of employees no longer plays a role " in the government 's policies .
a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .

he insisted that he stands by his message and " believes in " the product .
a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.09.2006 opinion : beware the slippery slope ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worried about possible islamic hostility , the deutsche oper wiped its rendition of mozart 's " idomeneo " from its current season .
dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .
the lesson to be learned is this : beware the slippery slope ! marcel fürstenau is a political correspondent for dw-radio in berlin -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mozart opera dropped due to terror threat german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision " crazy " and producer hans neuenfels protested , but mozart 's " idomeneo " will not be performed at the deutsche oper because it could upset muslims .

he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

" germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate .

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either .

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either . " of course , one of the effects of this conference is that our society takes more note of the fact that muslims are part of this society , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish center in germany has high hopes for islam summit the center for turkish studies in essen sees the upcoming islam summit as an opportunity to improve the religion 's standing in germany .

" ali larijani is in berlin with his delegation to meet javier solana , " an iranian source close to the negotiations told afp news service ahead of the talks , which state television said would be getting under way sometime wednesday afternoon . the discussions have been billed as a last opportunity for iran to agree to a suspension of sensitive uranium enrichment activities as demanded by the un security council and stave off the threat of un sanctions . the deal offered by the five permanent council members plus germany asks iran to accept a package of incentives in exchange for it freezing enrichment work the west fears could be channeled into producing nuclear arms . iran " optimistic , " minister says " the third round of talks between solana and larijani was supposed to be held today in new york but due to visa problems for mr. larijani it will be held today in one of the european countries , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has been meeting on the subject of iran for months " since there is an atmosphere of understanding between iran and europe , we can be optimistic on the results of the meeting , " mottaki was quoted as saying by iranian state television . the official news agency irna said that larijani could also use the occasion to meet german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the question of whether iran is prepared to suspend uranium enrichment for a limited period of time before or even during full negotiations with world powers remains key to the success of wednesday 's talks . suspension under debate however there was confusion over whether iran is considering such a step .
european diplomats said larijani made an offer at his last talks with solana but several iranian officials have denied any suspension is on the cards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 27.09.2006 government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government will submit an application for a partial , not full , smoking ban in restaurants after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby . germany 's ruling coalition is under fire from the green party after it was revealed tuesday that the conservatives and social democrats have decided against a blanket ban on smoking in restaurants across the country .
the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .
however , it is also expected to call for a separate area for smokers even in restaurants of this size . these recommendations precisely correspond to those put forward by the german federation of the cigarette industry -lrb- vdc -rrb- . coalition accused of profit before health bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staff in restaurants are at risk from passive smoking bärbel höhn , acting leader of the green party 's parliamentary faction , accused the coalition of " kneeling before the tobacco lobby " and told the süddeutsche zeitung that " it is obvious the health of employees no longer plays a role " in the government 's policies .
a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .
-lrb- 09.08.2006 -rrb- german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .
-lrb- 31.07.2006 -rrb- german minister wants public smoking ban in 2007 germany 's minister for consumer affairs has said he expects a ban on smoking in public places to take effect sometime in 2007 .
whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .

should there be areas in public spaces for smokers or should it be banned completely ?

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .
however , it is also expected to call for a separate area for smokers even in restaurants of this size . these recommendations precisely correspond to those put forward by the german federation of the cigarette industry -lrb- vdc -rrb- . coalition accused of profit before health bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staff in restaurants are at risk from passive smoking bärbel höhn , acting leader of the green party 's parliamentary faction , accused the coalition of " kneeling before the tobacco lobby " and told the süddeutsche zeitung that " it is obvious the health of employees no longer plays a role " in the government 's policies .
a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .
-lrb- 09.08.2006 -rrb- german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .

" ali larijani is in berlin with his delegation to meet javier solana , " an iranian source close to the negotiations told afp news service ahead of the talks , which state television said would be getting under way sometime wednesday afternoon . the discussions have been billed as a last opportunity for iran to agree to a suspension of sensitive uranium enrichment activities as demanded by the un security council and stave off the threat of un sanctions . the deal offered by the five permanent council members plus germany asks iran to accept a package of incentives in exchange for it freezing enrichment work the west fears could be channeled into producing nuclear arms . iran " optimistic , " minister says " the third round of talks between solana and larijani was supposed to be held today in new york but due to visa problems for mr. larijani it will be held today in one of the european countries , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has been meeting on the subject of iran for months " since there is an atmosphere of understanding between iran and europe , we can be optimistic on the results of the meeting , " mottaki was quoted as saying by iranian state television . the official news agency irna said that larijani could also use the occasion to meet german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the question of whether iran is prepared to suspend uranium enrichment for a limited period of time before or even during full negotiations with world powers remains key to the success of wednesday 's talks . suspension under debate however there was confusion over whether iran is considering such a step .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .
" brief , fitting , pithy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth says the trial is a gift for the far right for his part , the mail-order salesman said he did n't really understand why he was being tried .
he insisted that he stands by his message and " believes in " the product .
a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "
she even brought charges against herself in protest , accusing herself of publicly wearing a button sporting a struck-through swastika .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .

you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam .

" it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

" while barcelona already have the comfort of three points on the board , bremen have yet to register after losing their opening fixture 2-0 to chelsea . defeat to spanish champions barcelona would leave bremen with a mountain to climb to qualify for the knockout stage with frank rijkaard 's team and chelsea already having a head start . bremen 's strike force struggling for fitness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose may be risked despite injury the fitness of german international attacker miroslav klose , the golden boot winner at the world cup , is crucial for bremen and they are praying he is fit for barcelona after missing the last two league matches with an ankle injury .

" we need to have more confidence in ourselves against barcelona , " borowski said .
" we must go in with no fear .

" of course i am disappointed not to be playing .
it irritates me - otherwise i would not be a real footballer .
but my time will come and i will score my goals here .
i am not gripped by fear of failing at bayern . " bayern 's most notable absentee will be owen hargreaves .

" ali larijani is in berlin with his delegation to meet javier solana , " an iranian source close to the negotiations told afp news service ahead of the talks , which state television said would be getting under way sometime wednesday afternoon . the discussions have been billed as a last opportunity for iran to agree to a suspension of sensitive uranium enrichment activities as demanded by the un security council and stave off the threat of un sanctions . the deal offered by the five permanent council members plus germany asks iran to accept a package of incentives in exchange for it freezing enrichment work the west fears could be channeled into producing nuclear arms . iran " optimistic , " minister says " the third round of talks between solana and larijani was supposed to be held today in new york but due to visa problems for mr. larijani it will be held today in one of the european countries , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has been meeting on the subject of iran for months " since there is an atmosphere of understanding between iran and europe , we can be optimistic on the results of the meeting , " mottaki was quoted as saying by iranian state television . the official news agency irna said that larijani could also use the occasion to meet german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the question of whether iran is prepared to suspend uranium enrichment for a limited period of time before or even during full negotiations with world powers remains key to the success of wednesday 's talks . suspension under debate however there was confusion over whether iran is considering such a step .
european diplomats said larijani made an offer at his last talks with solana but several iranian officials have denied any suspension is on the cards . " such issues will not be addressed in the next negotiations , " atomic energy organization deputy head mohammad saeedi told the iranian student news agency isna on tuesday . but the washington times newspaper also reported tuesday that iran was close to agreeing to a secret deal that would have it suspend uranium enrichment for 90 days in order for additional talks to take place with european nations . diplomatic effort the us state department spokesman meanwhile spoke of " hopeful " signs from iran but warned sanctions were still on tap if diplomacy failed . the repeated delays for the latest larijani-solana meeting - they last met sept .
9-10 in vienna - appear to reflect intense diplomatic efforts to ensure the nuclear dossier does not go to the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad , addressing the un general assembly iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile again hit out at the west for what he described as its failure to allow iran access to peaceful nuclear technology . controversial policy " today the people will not accept that some countries have warehouses full of nuclear weapons and then tell others that you can not have a -lrb- nuclear -rrb- fuel cycle since you may deviate , " he said in a speech . iran 's uranium enrichment is particularly controversial as it can be used to make fuel for a nuclear power station but in highly enriched form can also be employed to make the explosive core of a nuclear bomb . iran insists that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful energy needs , vehemently rejecting us allegations that it is seeking to manufacture nuclear weapons . the negotiations were given a last chance after washington , under pressure from europe and china , backed down on its demand for immediate sanctions against iran for failing to meet an aug .
31 un deadline to freeze enrichment . according to european diplomats , western powers have set the start of october as a final deadline for iran to give its definitive response to the security council offer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran : eu nuke talks " step in the right direction " a sudden change of venue from paris to geneva failed to smooth over the discord at iran-eu nuclear talks .

" ali larijani is in berlin with his delegation to meet javier solana , " an iranian source close to the negotiations told afp news service ahead of the talks , which state television said would be getting under way sometime wednesday afternoon . the discussions have been billed as a last opportunity for iran to agree to a suspension of sensitive uranium enrichment activities as demanded by the un security council and stave off the threat of un sanctions . the deal offered by the five permanent council members plus germany asks iran to accept a package of incentives in exchange for it freezing enrichment work the west fears could be channeled into producing nuclear arms . iran " optimistic , " minister says " the third round of talks between solana and larijani was supposed to be held today in new york but due to visa problems for mr. larijani it will be held today in one of the european countries , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has been meeting on the subject of iran for months " since there is an atmosphere of understanding between iran and europe , we can be optimistic on the results of the meeting , " mottaki was quoted as saying by iranian state television . the official news agency irna said that larijani could also use the occasion to meet german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the question of whether iran is prepared to suspend uranium enrichment for a limited period of time before or even during full negotiations with world powers remains key to the success of wednesday 's talks . suspension under debate however there was confusion over whether iran is considering such a step .
european diplomats said larijani made an offer at his last talks with solana but several iranian officials have denied any suspension is on the cards . " such issues will not be addressed in the next negotiations , " atomic energy organization deputy head mohammad saeedi told the iranian student news agency isna on tuesday . but the washington times newspaper also reported tuesday that iran was close to agreeing to a secret deal that would have it suspend uranium enrichment for 90 days in order for additional talks to take place with european nations . diplomatic effort the us state department spokesman meanwhile spoke of " hopeful " signs from iran but warned sanctions were still on tap if diplomacy failed . the repeated delays for the latest larijani-solana meeting - they last met sept .
9-10 in vienna - appear to reflect intense diplomatic efforts to ensure the nuclear dossier does not go to the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad , addressing the un general assembly iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile again hit out at the west for what he described as its failure to allow iran access to peaceful nuclear technology . controversial policy " today the people will not accept that some countries have warehouses full of nuclear weapons and then tell others that you can not have a -lrb- nuclear -rrb- fuel cycle since you may deviate , " he said in a speech . iran 's uranium enrichment is particularly controversial as it can be used to make fuel for a nuclear power station but in highly enriched form can also be employed to make the explosive core of a nuclear bomb . iran insists that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful energy needs , vehemently rejecting us allegations that it is seeking to manufacture nuclear weapons . the negotiations were given a last chance after washington , under pressure from europe and china , backed down on its demand for immediate sanctions against iran for failing to meet an aug .
31 un deadline to freeze enrichment . according to european diplomats , western powers have set the start of october as a final deadline for iran to give its definitive response to the security council offer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran : eu nuke talks " step in the right direction " a sudden change of venue from paris to geneva failed to smooth over the discord at iran-eu nuclear talks .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .

a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

" we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .

but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

" ali larijani is in berlin with his delegation to meet javier solana , " an iranian source close to the negotiations told afp news service ahead of the talks , which state television said would be getting under way sometime wednesday afternoon . the discussions have been billed as a last opportunity for iran to agree to a suspension of sensitive uranium enrichment activities as demanded by the un security council and stave off the threat of un sanctions . the deal offered by the five permanent council members plus germany asks iran to accept a package of incentives in exchange for it freezing enrichment work the west fears could be channeled into producing nuclear arms . iran " optimistic , " minister says " the third round of talks between solana and larijani was supposed to be held today in new york but due to visa problems for mr. larijani it will be held today in one of the european countries , " foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has been meeting on the subject of iran for months " since there is an atmosphere of understanding between iran and europe , we can be optimistic on the results of the meeting , " mottaki was quoted as saying by iranian state television . the official news agency irna said that larijani could also use the occasion to meet german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the question of whether iran is prepared to suspend uranium enrichment for a limited period of time before or even during full negotiations with world powers remains key to the success of wednesday 's talks . suspension under debate however there was confusion over whether iran is considering such a step .
european diplomats said larijani made an offer at his last talks with solana but several iranian officials have denied any suspension is on the cards . " such issues will not be addressed in the next negotiations , " atomic energy organization deputy head mohammad saeedi told the iranian student news agency isna on tuesday . but the washington times newspaper also reported tuesday that iran was close to agreeing to a secret deal that would have it suspend uranium enrichment for 90 days in order for additional talks to take place with european nations . diplomatic effort the us state department spokesman meanwhile spoke of " hopeful " signs from iran but warned sanctions were still on tap if diplomacy failed . the repeated delays for the latest larijani-solana meeting - they last met sept .
9-10 in vienna - appear to reflect intense diplomatic efforts to ensure the nuclear dossier does not go to the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president ahmadinejad , addressing the un general assembly iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile again hit out at the west for what he described as its failure to allow iran access to peaceful nuclear technology . controversial policy " today the people will not accept that some countries have warehouses full of nuclear weapons and then tell others that you can not have a -lrb- nuclear -rrb- fuel cycle since you may deviate , " he said in a speech . iran 's uranium enrichment is particularly controversial as it can be used to make fuel for a nuclear power station but in highly enriched form can also be employed to make the explosive core of a nuclear bomb . iran insists that its nuclear program is solely for peaceful energy needs , vehemently rejecting us allegations that it is seeking to manufacture nuclear weapons . the negotiations were given a last chance after washington , under pressure from europe and china , backed down on its demand for immediate sanctions against iran for failing to meet an aug .
31 un deadline to freeze enrichment . according to european diplomats , western powers have set the start of october as a final deadline for iran to give its definitive response to the security council offer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran : eu nuke talks " step in the right direction " a sudden change of venue from paris to geneva failed to smooth over the discord at iran-eu nuclear talks .

" now we need to crank it up , " said former porto midfielder deco , who has won the title twice in the past three seasons .
" we want to win in bremen like we did last year and that would be a great start to the champions league defense . " while barcelona already have the comfort of three points on the board , bremen have yet to register after losing their opening fixture 2-0 to chelsea . defeat to spanish champions barcelona would leave bremen with a mountain to climb to qualify for the knockout stage with frank rijkaard 's team and chelsea already having a head start . bremen 's strike force struggling for fitness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroslav klose may be risked despite injury the fitness of german international attacker miroslav klose , the golden boot winner at the world cup , is crucial for bremen and they are praying he is fit for barcelona after missing the last two league matches with an ankle injury . " first our defense was the topic of debate , now it is our attack , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf . the goals have dried up for werder with croat marksman ivan klasnic and klose injured and schaaf may gamble on the latter . " it is possible that he -lrb- klose -rrb- could play , " schaaf said . bremen are also without brazilian playmaker diego who injured his knee in saturday 's 1-1 draw with hamburg . bremen 's suspect defense will certainly be tested by brazilian maestro ronaldinho and cameroon star samuel eto 'o , with the intelligent deco supplying the ammunition , but bremen 's german international tim borowksi is not afraid . " we need to have more confidence in ourselves against barcelona , " borowski said .
" we must go in with no fear . " if bremen 's players want to achieve that they would be well advised not to watch the tape of barcelona 's 4-0 drubbing of their league rivals bayern munich in a recent friendly match . bayern look to build on moscow win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern thrashed spartak 4-0 in their opening game bayern themselves will face a tough time in milan against an inter side fielding a rejuvenated and in-form hernan crespo . " at the moment things are going well for me and , most of all , for inter , " crespo told inter 's website .
" -lrb- the bayern game -rrb- will be hard match , but a nice one to play in . " bayern general manager uli hoeness said inter were strong favorites to win the tie . " they 're a class above us this season , " he said . podolski out of form ; hargreaves injured lukas podolski , the pin-up boy of german football who has failed to score a league goal for bayern since his summer move from fc cologne , is expected to start on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has n't replicated his cologne form at bayern the german international , whose stock rose dramatically after his impressive world cup performances , was dropped for saturday 's match at alemannia aachen , which bayern won 2-1 . however , despite his poor form , the determined 21-year-old believes he will soon start hitting the net . " things are not going how i thought they would , " podolski said .
" of course i am disappointed not to be playing .
it irritates me - otherwise i would not be a real footballer .
but my time will come and i will score my goals here .
i am not gripped by fear of failing at bayern . " bayern 's most notable absentee will be owen hargreaves .
the england midfielder suffered a fractured left leg earlier this month and is unlikely to return for several weeks . bayern , who like inter are top of their domestic league , began their champions league campaign with a 4-0 win over spartak moscow . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed fortunes for german clubs in champions league draw bayern munich will be quietly confident , sv hamburg will fancy their chances as an underdog , and werder bremen will be cursing their luck after the european champions league draw .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .

" we have known for a long time that the security concept contained big holes , which will require more money to put right than was earlier suggested , " ude told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" we were especially concerned about the security situation in the planned three-kilometer-long -lrb- 1.9-mile-long -rrb- tunnel which the transrapid would go through at top speed .
we asked about the rescue possibilities in the emergency plan , but we did not receive a satisfactory answer . " ude added he would prefer to see the city invest in an ordinary high-speed train for the planned line which would link the city center to munich 's international airport . mourners gather to remember dead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff speaks at the memorial service german president horst köhler was among the dignitaries attending the memorial service for those who were killed in the accident , along with christian wulff , the leader of the state of lower saxony . wulff spoke at the service at the st. vitus church and told the attending relatives that the whole country was thinking of them in their grief . " the pictures from lathen are fresh in all our minds , " he said .
" death came to them suddenly , tearing husbands and wives , mothers and fathers away from their loved ones . " the 23 victims of the collision included 10 employees from the rwe energy company who were riding on the train as part of a business trip .
two americans were also killed . the collision , which investigators believe was caused by human error , has cast a shadow over efforts to market the revolutionary train which floats above its track and can travel at up to 450 kilometers -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- per hour . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high hopes for transrapid 's future dw-world.de 's readers expressed the hope that the magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train crash that killed 23 people on friday would not spell the end for the transrapid project .

the symbol has come to stand for anti-nazi sentiment .
" every citizen should take a stand against the extreme right , " he said . the prosecution argued that german law strictly forbids the use of symbols associated with the nazi regime , no matter in what context they are used in . the social democrats , which make up one half of the power-sharing government , have accused the stuttgart authorities of prosecuting someone whose actions were " a useful support to the democratic ethos . " germany 's federal court of justice ruled in 1973 that it was not illegal to produce a swastika providing it had clearly been altered for the purposes of protesting against nazism . during the trial , state prosecutor bernhard häussler said the businessman was guilty of using symbols from unconstitutional organizations .
the state argued that it is irrelevant what the intent of the wearer is , and also did n't matter that the symbol has been altered .
the symbol should simply not be used publicly .
" it symbolizes the nazi era , " he said .
" brief , fitting , pithy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth says the trial is a gift for the far right for his part , the mail-order salesman said he did n't really understand why he was being tried .
he insisted that he stands by his message and " believes in " the product .
a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .

germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .
but some muslim groups have been critical in the run-up . interior minister wolfgang schäuble will welcome delegates from germany 's muslim communities , as well as representatives from federal , state and communal levels to berlin 's historic charlottenburg palace on wednesday . " three million muslims live in germany .
they are a part of germany 's present and future , just as islam is , after all , a part of europe , " schäuble said in an interview published tuesday in the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" we have to and want to take note of this . " over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .
however , it is also expected to call for a separate area for smokers even in restaurants of this size . these recommendations precisely correspond to those put forward by the german federation of the cigarette industry -lrb- vdc -rrb- . coalition accused of profit before health bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staff in restaurants are at risk from passive smoking bärbel höhn , acting leader of the green party 's parliamentary faction , accused the coalition of " kneeling before the tobacco lobby " and told the süddeutsche zeitung that " it is obvious the health of employees no longer plays a role " in the government 's policies .
a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .
-lrb- 09.08.2006 -rrb- german chancellor voices support for public smoking ban the growing campaign to ban smoking in public places across germany received a boost sunday when chancellor angela merkel was quoted in a newspaper interview giving her support to calls for such a ban .
-lrb- 31.07.2006 -rrb- german minister wants public smoking ban in 2007 germany 's minister for consumer affairs has said he expects a ban on smoking in public places to take effect sometime in 2007 .
whether bars and restaurants will be included is still under debate .
-lrb- 24.07.2006 -rrb- feedback what is your opinion on smoking bans ?
should there be areas in public spaces for smokers or should it be banned completely ?

" over the next two to three years , the 30 participants taking part in the conference are supposed to address the major issues that affect the coexistence of muslims and non-muslims in germany . schäuble said the conference also aimed to find better solutions for integrating muslims into german society , adding that he wanted muslims in germany to become " german muslims , " according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . dialogue can foster a sound relationship schäuble said any muslims living in germany have to accept the country 's basic laws , norms and values , and that germany 's constitutional law could not be negotiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islam instruction is available at some german schools already " we want open-minded muslims in our open-minded country , " schäuble said .
" that is why the state has to enter into a sound relationship with the members of this religious community .
this is why we are trying to usher in a dialogue . " the conference will work " as concretely as possible , " schäuble said .
one major aim of the working groups is to develop curricula for islam instruction at german public schools . " i also want to get to the point where we can educate imams in germany and that prayers are conducted in german in the mosques , " the minister said . but schäuble said criticism was also part of the work . " we 're not opening an event where we solely exchange niceties , " he said . expectations are high representatives from the four major muslim organizations said in a joint statement they were going into the conference " with high expectations . " " we expressly welcome the german government 's efforts to lastingly address the complex of islam and muslims in germany , " said the statement , issued on sunday by the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , the islamic council , the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- and the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim groups want to be considered equal to christian churches they said the integration of islam into the german state system and the integration of muslims into society were the top priorities . but they criticized that they could n't recognize the concrete goal of the conference yet .
ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said muslim organizations had been inadequately informed about the meeting 's contents . " most of what is to take place at the conference we found out through the media , " kizilkaya told the neue osnabrücker zeitung .
but he said he welcomed that such an event was finally taking place , albeit late . muslim groups critical of conference organization the organizations also said the hosts did not consider the self-organization of germany 's muslims .
the mosques , as the central unit of islamic religion , always have to be the starting point for proper representation and the legal integration of muslims , the groups said . the country 's approximately 2,500 mosque communities " which attend to all muslims and thus mold the life of islam in germany " should therefore be considered accordingly in the conference 's composition , the groups added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's muslim community is very diverse " the composition of the islam conference does not represent the correct proportional representation , " zdm 's general secretary aiman mazyek told the daily frankfurter rundschau . mazyek said that the four major muslim umbrella organizations should be the main contacts and criticized the invitation of 10 individuals who represent a more secular islam . mazyek said he had the impression that germany wanted to " open up a state-sanctioned debate club . " germany needs representative partners in the muslim community schäuble said he had invited representatives form muslim organizations , as well as personalities who had shaped the debate on islam . " i did n't become an islamic censor while making invitations , " he said . in view of the many different communities in germany , schäuble said that muslims should organize themselves so that the government had " representative partners . " " muslims want the government to treat them the same as the christian churches .
then they have to create the organizational requirements for this , " he added . the delegates from germany 's muslim communities said they are open to the debate . " we have decided to participate in the conference 's launch as a sign of our underlying will to constructively co-operate , " the major muslim organizations said in their statement . according to schäuble , the work is not just one-sided , either . " of course , one of the effects of this conference is that our society takes more note of the fact that muslims are part of this society , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish center in germany has high hopes for islam summit the center for turkish studies in essen sees the upcoming islam summit as an opportunity to improve the religion 's standing in germany .

the greens have accused the government of bending to the will of the powerful tobacco lobby . the christian democratic union 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary leader norbert röttgen announced that the cdu , its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- would consider the facts regarding the dangers of passive smoking in its application to parliament on a smoking ban but would also be sure not to let the rights of non-smokers outweigh those of smokers . conservative sources privately accept this to mean that the general prohibition of smoking in restaurants is now off the cards . the precise contents of the coalition application are to be negotiated at a meeting on wednesday .
it is expected that the application for a ban will include a smoking ban in restaurants in establishments which have a floor area of over 75 square meters .
however , it is also expected to call for a separate area for smokers even in restaurants of this size . these recommendations precisely correspond to those put forward by the german federation of the cigarette industry -lrb- vdc -rrb- . coalition accused of profit before health bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staff in restaurants are at risk from passive smoking bärbel höhn , acting leader of the green party 's parliamentary faction , accused the coalition of " kneeling before the tobacco lobby " and told the süddeutsche zeitung that " it is obvious the health of employees no longer plays a role " in the government 's policies .
a 50 percent increase in the possibility of lung cancer in restaurant employees was " obviously something the cdu and spd could live with , " höhn said . the greens urged the government to release details of its agenda before the meeting with the consumer 's committee on wednesday .
the committee 's chairperson ulrike höfken from the green party has already made it clear that she believes partial bans are " not a significant solution " to the problem . the latest studies about the dangers of passive smoking and the ineffectiveness of the present regulations showed that a full legal ban on smoking in restaurants is necessary to protect the health of employees working regularly in smoky environments . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

dw 's marcel fürstenau says the move is a sign of a greater social trend . the artistic director of berlin 's deutsche oper , kirsten harms , has cancelled a performance of the mozart opera " idomeneo " that is critical of religion .
the reason : she could not rule out that such a production would represent a danger for employees of the opera , or the public . these fears are based on a danger-analysis done by the state criminal police .
the analysis was carried out upon request of the state interior minister .
according to the report , the opera – which was already performed three years ago , without fanfare – represented an " incalculable risk . " jesus , buddah , mohammed - and poseidon if this supposition is true , then it is because muslims could feel that their religious feelings were hurt or insulted .
but above and beyond the acknowledgement that it is regrettable to insult anyone 's religion , many questions come to mind in this instance : will muslims ' feelings really be hurt ?
what about christians ?
buddhists ?
and what about people who believe in greek mythology ? after all , the whole ruckus here is based on an interpretation of the opera " idomeneo " by director hans neuenfels .
he shows his relations to the role of religion and gods in a scene where the decapitated heads of jesus , buddah , mohammed and poseidon are set on chairs . the scene is generally critical of religion , yet not in any way exclusively critical of , or hostile to , islam .
in other words , there is not the slightest reason to resort to self-censure of this nature , removing the opera from the season 's program in a rush of overly hasty obedience .
anyone who chooses to make such a decision clearly has a disturbed relationship to art and the freedom of speech – the elixirs of an enlightened society .
in fact , whoever shakes these foundations is encouraging radicals of all stripes to challenge democracy . social climate on view germany clearly already finds itself in such an atmosphere , at least to some extent .
that 's the only way to explain how an opera 's artistic director could allow her artistic freedom to be curtailed by diffuse speculations over the possible response to a planned performance . and on top of that , harms did it of her own free will .
according to the police , there were , and are , no concrete plans for actions or attacks due to the now-cancelled " idomeneo " performance . in the end , the whole issue comes down to a general , abstract description of the social climate in germany that has existed since caricatures critical of islam were published in a danish newspaper . lack of courage ? if the deutsche oper decision is an indication of future behavior , then it spells the end of the artistic freedom and freedom of expression in germany -lrb- even though the decision of the artistic director , who was looking out for the safety of her employees and the public , is certainly understandable on a human level . -rrb- three years ago , at the premiere of this particular production of " idomeneo , " no one would have given a thought to the opera 's effects on muslims .
seen thus , it is clear that the current situation in berlin is a symptom of a lack of courage , a lack of self-confidence , and of fear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.09.2006 political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddha , mohammed , poseidon and jesus all appear in the opera a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .
the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .
" i think that is the right way to end a debate that is no one 's interest , particularly not for the great majority of muslims in germany . " sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens dialogue with country 's muslim community germany hosts its first-ever " conference on islam " in berlin on wednesday and aims to improve interaction with muslims living in germany .

the move has sparked a fierce debate on the limits of artistic freedom and religious respect . many religions could find director hans neuenfels ' adaptation of mozart 's " idomeneo " blasphemous .
although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .

although the opera itself makes make no reference to islam , neuenfels introduced the closing scene that depicts the decapitated heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus christ , buddha and the greek god poseidon . the director of the german opera , kirsten harms , said she had made her decision in consideration of the " very agitated situation " caused by the remarks by pope benedict xvi. earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms cancelled the opera on police advice in a speech the pope made while visiting his native germany , he quoted from a medieval text by christian emperor manuel ii that criticized some teachings of the prophet mohammed as " evil and inhuman . "
the speech had sparked outrage in the muslim world . " i see an opportunity here to lead an urgently needed discourse on the understanding between islam and christianity , " harms said .
" it is n't the cancellation of the piece , but rather a possibility to react sensibly and simply conduct this discourse . " political leaders stress dangers of self-censorship harms said she had received a warning that something could happen at the opera house if the piece were played .
but berlin police said they had received no specific threats of a planned attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehearsals of idomeneo have been discontinued german politicians meanwhile cautioned against taking self-censorship too far .
german chancellor angela merkel said germany had to be careful not to retreat further because of fear from violent radicals . hans-joachim otto , head of the parliamentary committee for culture and media , said artistic freedom and freedom of expression needed to be guaranteed . " western achievements are at stake here , " otto , a member of the free-market liberal fdp party fdp , told dw-radio . culture minister bernd neumann said harms ' decision was wrong .
the removal of " idomeneo " undermined creative freedom , he said . " if worries about possible protests lead to self-censorship , that threatens democratic culture , " neumann said .
" it requires tolerance and courage from us all : tolerance in the face of uncomfortable opinions and courage in the face of controversy .
you can not solve problems by being silent . " in this context , neumann also referred to this week 's moving of the controversial television film " wut " or " anger " from primetime to a late-night slot .
the film about a violent youth of turkish heritage in berlin had been criticized in german media as portraying a negative picture of foreigners . muslim groups express mixed reactions kenan kolat , who chairs an umbrella group of turkish associations in germany , criticized the cancellation .
he said he could understand why some muslims would be angered by the opera , but that they must accept creative liberty in a democratic society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims worldwide protested the european publication of mohammed cartoons " it 's a pity they are scared of public discussion , " kolat said , adding that art was not politics .
" art must be free . " it 's a big difference whether the pope or a politician says something or whether you 're dealing with a performance or a caricature , " kolat said , referring to muslim anger over the printing of 12 caricatures of the prophet mohammed by several european newspapers last year . aiman mazyek , general secretary of the central council of muslims , said the cancellation was " not a good decision . "
he said the discussion about the opera 's production was therefore lost . but ali kizilkaya , chairman of the islamic council for germany , said the opera was offensive to muslims and unacceptable . " an opera or a caricature - it does n't make a big difference , " kizilkaya said .
islam considers any image of the prophet to be blasphemous . it 's a fine line between fear and respect klaus staeck , president of berlin 's academy of the arts , said he found the reaction disproportionate .
at the same time , staeck said it was important to distinguish between fear of and respect for islam . " i have the feeling that we are on the way to developing a fear which increasingly restricts our perception of freedom of speech and artistic freedom , " staeck said , adding that otherwise the day would come when hardly anything would be possible anymore in the cultural sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german opera is a berlin landmark still , even artistic freedom had its limits , staeck said .
art did n't exist in a vacuum , but rather in the middle of society . rolf bolwin , director of the german theater and orchestra association , said he hoped the decision in berlin would not affect program planning in the rest of germany . " it just ca n't be that we have to ask ourselves whether we can play pieces at all which center around religion or islam , " bolwin said . christians and muslims should watch the opera together for many critics , opera director harms is giving the impression that culture can be blackmailed .
but dieter david scholz , an opera expert and author , defended her decision . " this is to date really an unparalleled case in german cultural life , " scholz said .
" it 's a very serious situation and of course it 's a great incalculable risk for the audience and for the director .
she ca n't and should n't take this risk . " fdp parliamentarian otto suggested christians and muslims watch " idomeneo " together and then discuss it . " those would be positive signals to promote the coexistence of cultures and religions in germany , " otto said . his suggestion did n't fall on deaf ears .
delegates at germany 's first " conference on islam , " which was called by german interior minister wolfgang schäuble to address growing alienation between germans and muslim immigrants , issued a joint call supporting the staging of " idomeneo . " " we would like to send a message by saying that we would like to attend it together , " schäuble said .
" i think that is the right way to end a debate that is no one 's interest , particularly not for the great majority of muslims in germany .

a crossed-out swastika is recognized internationally as an anti-nazi symbol , he said ; it is " brief , fitting , and pithy . "
the trial provoked criticism from politicians , including claudia roth , head of the green party .
she called the legal proceedings " counterproductive , " and said they were " a gift for the extreme right . "

one of their first acts on seizing power was to introduce their strict interpretation of islam .
this included the banning of women from work and education , and the prohibition of all music and television .
along with these harsh regulations came strict islamic punishments , which included stoning to death and amputations .
the taleban were forced out of power in 2001 but today the country is once again facing a resurgence of taleban militancy .
music banned back in 1996 the world changed beyond all recognition for many afghans .
women in particular suffered from the sweeping changes brought by the taleban .
many tens of thousands lost their jobs , girls ' schools were closed and women were forbidden from appearing in public unless covered from head to foot in the all-encompassing burkha .
everyday pleasures were banned with a zeal never before witnessed in the modern islamic world .
the taleban 's afghanistan was without music , television or images of any kind .
even the flying of kites - a hugely popular pastime among afghan children - was considered frivolous and un-islamic .
kabul in 2006 is all very , very different .
muslim traditions are of course still observed .
this is the month of ramadan - a time for fasting and devotional prayer .
but what is different now , an afghan friend told me , is that if you choose not to fast , you will not be punished .
the religious police are no longer watching your every move .
music - not just traditional afghan melodies , but the harsh beats of techno and rap - now blare out of radios across the city .
resurgent taleban but this new cosmopolitan lifestyle is only a very limited snapshot of afghanistan .
conflict and grinding poverty still hold back many of the changes enjoyed by the few in the more affluent cities .
and of course the taleban are once again emerging as a militant and political force in the southern provinces .
they do have some support - not least amongst those who see foreign forces in the country as just the latest wave of colonial aggressors .
but in kabul i found only fear - fear that the progress made in the five years since the taleban fled the city could be under threat .
everyone from the young female students now studying hard on the campus of kabul university to the migrant labourers looking for work in kabul 's thriving construction industry share that fear .
the taleban 's era was a dark age and not one they ever wish to see return .

one of their first acts on seizing power was to introduce their strict interpretation of islam .
this included the banning of women from work and education , and the prohibition of all music and television .
along with these harsh regulations came strict islamic punishments , which included stoning to death and amputations .
the taleban were forced out of power in 2001 but today the country is once again facing a resurgence of taleban militancy .
music banned back in 1996 the world changed beyond all recognition for many afghans .
women in particular suffered from the sweeping changes brought by the taleban .
many tens of thousands lost their jobs , girls ' schools were closed and women were forbidden from appearing in public unless covered from head to foot in the all-encompassing burkha .
everyday pleasures were banned with a zeal never before witnessed in the modern islamic world .
suicide bombings in kabul have become more frequent the taleban 's afghanistan was without music , television or images of any kind .
even the flying of kites - a hugely popular pastime among afghan children - was considered frivolous and un-islamic .
kabul in 2006 is all very , very different .
muslim traditions are of course still observed .
this is the month of ramadan - a time for fasting and devotional prayer .
but what is different now , an afghan friend told me , is that if you choose not to fast , you will not be punished .
the religious police are no longer watching your every move .
music - not just traditional afghan melodies , but the harsh beats of techno and rap - now blare out of radios across the city .
resurgent taleban but this new cosmopolitan lifestyle is only a very limited snapshot of afghanistan .
conflict and grinding poverty still hold back many of the changes enjoyed by the few in the more affluent cities .
and of course the taleban are once again emerging as a militant and political force in the southern provinces .
they do have some support - not least amongst those who see foreign forces in the country as just the latest wave of colonial aggressors .
but in kabul i found only fear - fear that the progress made in the five years since the taleban fled the city could be under threat .
everyone from the young female students now studying hard on the campus of kabul university to the migrant labourers looking for work in kabul 's thriving construction industry share that fear .
the taleban 's era was a dark age and not one they ever wish to see return .

one of their first acts on seizing power was to introduce their strict interpretation of islam .
this included the banning of women from work and education , and the prohibition of all music and television .
along with these harsh regulations came strict islamic punishments , which included stoning to death and amputations .
the taleban were forced out of power in 2001 but today the country is once again facing a resurgence of taleban militancy .
music banned back in 1996 the world changed beyond all recognition for many afghans .
women in particular suffered from the sweeping changes brought by the taleban .
many tens of thousands lost their jobs , girls ' schools were closed and women were forbidden from appearing in public unless covered from head to foot in the all-encompassing burkha .
everyday pleasures were banned with a zeal never before witnessed in the modern islamic world .
suicide bombings in kabul have become more frequent the taleban 's afghanistan was without music , television or images of any kind .
even the flying of kites - a hugely popular pastime among afghan children - was considered frivolous and un-islamic .
kabul in 2006 is all very , very different .
muslim traditions are of course still observed .
this is the month of ramadan - a time for fasting and devotional prayer .
but what is different now , an afghan friend told me , is that if you choose not to fast , you will not be punished .
the religious police are no longer watching your every move .
music - not just traditional afghan melodies , but the harsh beats of techno and rap - now blare out of radios across the city .
resurgent taleban but this new cosmopolitan lifestyle is only a very limited snapshot of afghanistan .
conflict and grinding poverty still hold back many of the changes enjoyed by the few in the more affluent cities .
and of course the taleban are once again emerging as a militant and political force in the southern provinces .
they do have some support - not least amongst those who see foreign forces in the country as just the latest wave of colonial aggressors .
but in kabul i found only fear - fear that the progress made in the five years since the taleban fled the city could be under threat .
everyone from the young female students now studying hard on the campus of kabul university to the migrant labourers looking for work in kabul 's thriving construction industry share that fear .
the taleban 's era was a dark age and not one they ever wish to see return .

london-based brandamp will be owned 50-50 by the two firms .
for universal artists , who range from the scissor sisters to stevie wonder , it is an opportunity for extra revenue beyond music sales and concerts .
under the deal , wpp , which counts ford and ibm among its clients , gets access to universal 's massive back catalogue .
" this new venture makes sense on many levels , " said chief executive of universal 's international division , lucian grainge .
" it brings together two creative communities which are driven by innovation and imagination . "
wpp chief executive sir martin sorrell told bbc news it allowed a " much closer relationship " between the two firms .
" it gives us direct access to a colossal back catalogue , from pop to jazz , that spans the whole world , " he said .
money-spinner while it is usually cheaper to compose music specifically for an advert than to buy publishing and recording rights , the latter route is often favoured by advertising agencies who can associate a brand with an artist or group , industry observers said .
as well as being money-spinners for existing artists , television commercials can also help launch unknown acts .
aqualung 's song , strange and beautiful became a number one hit after it featured on an advert for the vw beetle , while jose gonzalez found fame on the back of a commercial for the sony bravia television .
other tunes have become inextricably linked to advertising campaigns - for example the dandy warhol 's hit bohemian like you which has featured heavily in vodafone commercials .
the apple itunes music store even has a section devoted to songs used in adverts .
earlier this year , jack white of the white stripes wrote a song specifically for a coca-cola commercial - earning him critics in the industry for " selling out " .

london-based brandamp will be owned 50-50 by the two firms .
for universal artists , who range from the scissor sisters to stevie wonder , it is an opportunity for extra revenue beyond music sales and concerts .
under the deal , wpp , which counts ford and ibm among its clients , gets access to universal 's massive back catalogue .
" this new venture makes sense on many levels , " said chief executive of universal 's international division , lucian grainge .
" it brings together two creative communities which are driven by innovation and imagination . "
wpp chief executive sir martin sorrell told bbc news it allowed a " much closer relationship " between the two firms .
" it gives us direct access to a colossal back catalogue , from pop to jazz , that spans the whole world , " he said .
money-spinner while it is usually cheaper to compose music specifically for an advert than to buy publishing and recording rights , the latter route is often favoured by advertising agencies who can associate a brand with an artist or group , industry observers said .
as well as being money-spinners for existing artists , television commercials can also help launch unknown acts .
aqualung 's song , strange and beautiful became a number one hit after it featured on an advert for the vw beetle , while jose gonzalez found fame on the back of a commercial for the sony bravia television .
other tunes have become inextricably linked to advertising campaigns - for example the dandy warhol 's hit bohemian like you which has featured heavily in vodafone commercials .
the apple itunes music store even has a section devoted to songs used in adverts .
earlier this year , jack white of the white stripes wrote a song specifically for a coca-cola commercial - earning him critics in the industry for " selling out " .

up to 25 % of the world 's aviation carbon dioxide emissions could be cut if airlines , airports and governments worked together , the virgin boss said .
sir richard last week pledged virgin profits worth $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- towards renewable energy initiatives .
he is now urging others to support a cross-industry forum to tackle the " growing problem " of global warming .
in new york later today , sir richard will outline proposals he claims would save over 150m tonnes of carbon emissions a year .
" with global warming , the world is heading for a catastrophe .
the aviation industry must play its part in averting that , " he said .
efficient the aviation industry is responsible for around 2 % of global carbon dioxide emissions .
sir richard has written to airlines , airport operators and engine manufacturers stressing the need for the industry to increase the pace at which it changes its practices the self-made tycoon told bbc radio 4 's today programme that more efficient use of aircraft at the world 's busiest airports could make a big difference .
he outlined a " starting grid system " he claims could save " billions of tonnes " of carbon dioxide and cut fuel consumption before take-off by up to 90 % .
" instead of sitting on planes with co2 spewing out of those planes for anything up to 60 minutes to 90 minutes -lsb- while waiting for take-off -rsb- you would be towed by a small tug to the starting grid , " he said .
" then the pilot would turn on the engines ten minutes before take-off and then take off . "
smoother descent there would also be lower noise levels and cleaner air for those living near the airports , he said .
if all airlines adopted a slower and smoother descent method , this would " significantly " reduce fuel used in landing , sir richard said .

the scream and madonna were taken by two armed men in a raid in 2004 , and picked up minor marks and tears before they were recovered last month .
they will be displayed in oslo 's munch museum , protected by heavy glass boxes , until sunday .
" we wanted to share the homecoming with the public , " said museum director ingebjoerg ydstie .
" the paintings were not so badly damaged that they could not be displayed without full-artistic appreciation . "
" you ca n't see all the damage by eye .
much of the damage is at the micro level " biljana topalova-casadiego , munch museum conservator after the exhibition ends , experts will begin the time-consuming and painstaking process of repairing the artworks .
they will assess the damage , and agree on how to repair the paintings , said ms ydstie .
" there is a line between restoring and adding something to the pictures .
" you ca n't add new elements to an original munch work . "
but the paintings could be touched up with paint if deemed necessary , museum conservator biljana topalova-casadiego told the associated press news agency .
daring raid the paintings were stolen in 2004 by two armed men who ripped them from the museum 's wall after threatening a member of staff with a gun .
the robbers pulled the pictures out of their frames , possibly fearing they could have held tracking devices .
after a series of arrests in 2005 , three men were found guilty of charges relating to the theft in may this year , receiving prison sentences of between four to eight years .
police recovered the paintings in august and handed them back to the munch museum .
the gallery released photographs earlier this month which showed a rip in the canvas of madonna .
the scream - painted in 1893 and now one of the world 's most recognisable artworks - suffered less significant damage .
" one corner is dented as if someone had dropped it , and then there is some damp damage , " gro balas , an oslo culture official , told the reuters news agency .
but ms topalova-casadiego said further imperfections could be revealed by x-rays and microchip technology .
" you ca n't see all the damage by eye , " she said .
" much of the damage is at the micro level . "

the scream - painted in 1893 and now one of the world 's most recognisable artworks - suffered less significant damage .
" one corner is dented as if someone had dropped it , and then there is some damp damage , " gro balas , an oslo culture official , told the reuters news agency .
but ms topalova-casadiego said further imperfections could be revealed by x-rays and microchip technology .
" you ca n't see all the damage by eye , " she said .
" much of the damage is at the micro level . "
the scream and madonna were part of munch 's frieze of life series , in which sickness , death , anxiety and love were central themes .
the artist was a major influence in the modern expressionist movement and died in 1944 at the age of 80 .

mr ahern said he was lent the equivalent of $ 63,000 -lrb- £ 33,000 -rrb- to pay costs during his marital separation .
" i have broken absolutely no codes - ethical , tax , legal or otherwise , " he said in a television interview .
mr ahern has come under pressure to explain the loans , which he did not repay , following a newspaper article .
he said he had offered several times to repay the loans , but his lenders had refused to take the money back .
' debt of honour ' speaking on irish television , mr ahern confirmed he received an ir £ 22,500 -lrb- $ 36,000 ; £ 19,000 -rrb- loan from eight friends in december 1993 and a further loan of ir £ 16,500 in 1994 from four others .
he said the money went towards paying school fees as part of the settlement with his estranged wife , miriam kelly .
mr ahern said the payments were a " debt of honour " and denied any wrongdoing .
a visibly emotional taoiseach recalled the financial stress of his marriage break-up , which he described as " a dark , sad time " of his life .
" in the separation i agreed to provide ir £ 20,000 for my children to an education account as part of the agreement and i did that , " he said .
" and , i also had to pay off other bills , so the money i had saved was gone . "
general election news of the loans was leaked from confidential meetings between mr ahern and a state inquiry investigating planning irregularities in the irish capital , dublin , in the 1990s .
the bbc 's james helm in dublin says mr ahern will be hoping that by making public the details of the payments , for which he insists no favours were offered nor given in return , he can take the heat out of the matter and so limit any political damage ahead of a general election next year .
but one opposition leader , labour 's pat rabbitte , said mr ahern 's performance on national television had been " quite unconvincing " and that it raised a whole lot of new questions .

as a poorly paid worker , my salary at the end of the month is subjected to 37.5 % tax , then since it passes through the bank i pay another 1 % on any meagre interest earned , and then for any purchase that i make i must pay 17.5 % vat .
we pay so much tax but we do n't see where our tax is going .
if you look at life on the ground you see some very greedy politicians .
they take home a very fat pay - their tax-free salaries , hefty allowances and then halfway through their tenure as ministers of parliament they give themselves huge amounts of public funds in the guise of gratuity .
profile : zambia 's ' mr lucky ' focus on africa : zambia 2006 on top of this massive exploitation , each mp is allocated five pieces of land as a free gift .
for what ?
our legislators , the president included , just enter public offices to make themselves millionaires at the expense of the general population .
they are not looking at the common man and seeing how much he is suffering .
i lost my job in 1993 when the company i worked for was liquidated .
i received nothing , there were no benefits to come my way .
not even the little that was due to me .
my take home pay is almost peanuts after i 've paid the rent , bills , education for my children .
primary education and health is said to be free .
our leaders have killed our government schools by not providing enough resources .
zambian voters ' views naomi banda jonathan mutanga pauline songiso chance kaonga there are no teachers so you end up paying to send your children to private schools .
hospital staff are all on a ' go slow ' .
no-one will tend to you .
and if there is someone to care for you , you must pay for treatment and drugs .
