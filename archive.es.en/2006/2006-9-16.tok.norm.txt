there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .

all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .

the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .

a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .

the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .

' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .

"
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .

" i do not want to make excuses but the match calendar has certainly not helped , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" i am sure we will find our rhythm soon and not lose games like this . " nuremberg stay top of the table bayern 's loss means fc nuremberg lead the 18-strong bundesliga for the fourth successive week after a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club vfl bochum , jan polak cancelling out theofanis gekas ' early effort for bochum .
in sunday action , hertha berlin entertain schalke 04 with both sides knowing a win will send them top of the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's ivan saenko -lrb- l -rrb- challenges for the ball dutch international midfielder marc van bommel , a six million-euro signing from barcelona , put bayern ahead on his debut just six minutes in with a scrambled goal .
and despite continuing to dominate proceedings , felix magath 's side conceded an equalizer on 25 minutes when artur wichniarek ghosted in unmarked at the far post to head in joerg boehme 's free kick . danish dynamite explodes in bayern 's face the goal seemed to inspire the home side and bielefeld nearly went in front six minutes before half-time , but thorben marx 's thumping free kick sailed just over . claudio pizarro almost restored bayern 's lead on the hour mark but his header came back off the woodwork and an increasingly desperate magath sent on hasan salihamidzic and mehmet scholl for bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski in search of a winner . but instead it was bielefeld who scored , jonas kamper firing in an unstoppable shot with seven minutes remaining for a memorable win . " we conceded two goals from set-pieces and that can happen to any team , " said bayern 's german international philipp lahm .
" we did not allow them many chances but we are guilty of not being purposeful enough going forward . " bremen take a dive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen coach thomas schaaf looks all but amused fortunately for bayern , who fell to third in the table , their rivals once again failed to capitalize on their slip with bremen 's miserable run continuing with a 3-2 defeat against vfb stuttgart .
" we had a comfortable 2-0 lead and then we stopped putting tackles in , " said a livid bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" now is the time to stop talking and to start taking action . " bremen , who fall to seventh , hoped to get back on the winning trail after a german cup loss to third division pirmasens and a champions league defeat to chelsea .
they lost their star striker miroslav klose through injury shortly before the match but stormed into a two-goal lead with roberto hilbert heading into his own goal and egyptian international mohamed zidan producing a cool finish . but hilbert scored at the right end in the 32nd minute and it sparked a sensational comeback as goals from pavel pardo and luis gomez secured a 3-2 win for the visitors .
" that should not be allowed to happen , " fumed bremen captain frank baumann .
" we just invited the opposition to score goals . " … and hamburg barely keep their heads above water title hopefuls sv hamburg saw their woeful start to the season continue with a 1-0 loss at borussia dortmund .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .
the fund supported projects promoting mutual understanding , including renovation of historical sites .

' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .

"
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .

' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .

"
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .
however , he said in the czech-german declaration from 1997 the two countries promised that they would not force one another into any interpretation of history .

a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists have focused on youth with music cds he says it is particularly important to educate young people , who have been especially targeted by npd campaigns .

" i do not want to make excuses but the match calendar has certainly not helped , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" i am sure we will find our rhythm soon and not lose games like this . " nuremberg stay top of the table bayern 's loss means fc nuremberg lead the 18-strong bundesliga for the fourth successive week after a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club vfl bochum , jan polak cancelling out theofanis gekas ' early effort for bochum .
in sunday action , hertha berlin entertain schalke 04 with both sides knowing a win will send them top of the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's ivan saenko -lrb- l -rrb- challenges for the ball dutch international midfielder marc van bommel , a six million-euro signing from barcelona , put bayern ahead on his debut just six minutes in with a scrambled goal .
and despite continuing to dominate proceedings , felix magath 's side conceded an equalizer on 25 minutes when artur wichniarek ghosted in unmarked at the far post to head in joerg boehme 's free kick . danish dynamite explodes in bayern 's face the goal seemed to inspire the home side and bielefeld nearly went in front six minutes before half-time , but thorben marx 's thumping free kick sailed just over . claudio pizarro almost restored bayern 's lead on the hour mark but his header came back off the woodwork and an increasingly desperate magath sent on hasan salihamidzic and mehmet scholl for bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski in search of a winner . but instead it was bielefeld who scored , jonas kamper firing in an unstoppable shot with seven minutes remaining for a memorable win . " we conceded two goals from set-pieces and that can happen to any team , " said bayern 's german international philipp lahm .
" we did not allow them many chances but we are guilty of not being purposeful enough going forward .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .

' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .

prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .

in the wake of the comments , leaders of the faith demanded apologies , egypt and morocco took diplomatic action , and palestinian gunmen attacked churches . earlier saturday , the head of the roman catholic church said through a representative that his speech had been intended as a rejection of religiously-motivated violence from any side . his holiness regrets ...

"
in his speech , the pope quoted a 14th-century byzantine emperor who said innovations introduced by the prophet mohammed were " evil and inhuman " .

" " the vatican secretary of state says that the pope is sorry because his statements had been badly interpreted , but there is no bad interpretation , " abdel moneim abul futuh , a senior official with the group , told afp news service . diplomatic action the first christian leader to condemn the pope 's comments was the head of egypt 's coptic orthodox church .

egyptian ambassador wafa bassim , who summoned the envoy on the instructions of the foreign minister , said the pope must himself " move quickly to contain the situation . " and morocco announced it was recalling its ambassador to the vatican for consultations in the wake of the " offensive remarks . " attacks on churches after a day of protest in the west bank and gaza strip , palestinian gunmen responded to the pope 's comments by attacking churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope with vatican secretary of state cardinal bertone no one was hurt in a string of fire bombings and shootings that caused no major damage .
five churches came under attack in the west bank city of nablus , where militant groups have long been the dominating force . masked men , who local security officials said were undoubtedly palestinian militants , hurled fire bombs at the anglican and greek orthodox churches . in a second wave of attacks several hours later , palestinian assailants , this time unmasked , poured petrol outside the gates of the roman catholic , greek catholic and protestant churches , starting fires that were swiftly extinguished , witnesses said . appeal from the vatican the roman catholic church 's hierarchy appeared deeply concerned about the seriousness of the crisis the pope 's remarks has sparked .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi referred to the current furor as a " difficult time .

another russian tycoon now has a say as to who will play for argentina ’ s national team .
bayern munich 's gm fears a " russianization " of soccer . the influence of money - particularly money from a single patron - in professional soccer is exerting more influence in more unusual ways these days .
the latest headlines in soccer were not about the sale of a club , but rather the sale of rights to determine who can play a squad - and the team was no less than two-time world champion argentina . " i think that ’ s crazy , " bayern munich ’ s outspoken general manager uli hoeness said .
" for me , that is the beginning of the end of soccer . " russian billionaire victor felixovich wexelberg , better known for dealings at urbane art auctions than in sweaty locker rooms , paid 14 million euros -lrb- $ 17.9 million -rrb- for a say as to who the argentine soccer association will select onto the national team .
this is a first in the history of the sport and is a development that disconcerts hoeness . " if the russianization continues then in 10 years , we ’ ll be saying ' nostrovia , so long soccer , " ' he said , referring to russian oil tycoon roman abramovich who owns london club chelsea . e arn money - and attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil provided capital to buy london side chelsea hoeness ' counterpart in bremen , klaus allofs , views the developments in international soccer somewhat more rationally .
he admits that money is changing the world of soccer but that it is hardly a phenomenon that club and association functionaries can change . " you can decry it but soccer is not a world unto itself , " he said in an interview with the german newspaper kreiszeitung . " money from russia or other oil-rich countries is also going elsewhere and it has an effect .
that is a development that we can not stop . " " soccer is simply interesting for people like that , " he added .
" for one , you can earn money .
and also - which is even more important - you can gain attention . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 45 million euros brought andriy shevchenko to chelsea the big money in england , spain , and italy has certainly gained the attention of hoeness .
over the past few months , he has repeatedly said that due to the disproportionate incomes among the larger clubs in europe - either through willing owners pumping exorbitant sums of cash into teams or the fact that television revenues are better outside of germany - bayern munich should have no expectations of winning the champions league , the marquis competition in european club soccer . can solar energy save the sport ? a more equitable redistribution of riches helps keep the bundesliga relatively exciting .
still , in the past nine years , bayern munich has taken the domestic title a total of seven times .
but a return to their powerhouse status of the late 1990 's in the champions league seems less likely . " a new bayern munich era is impossible , " former bayern player stefan effenberg told premiere television .
" they have simply been too disappointing in the champions league the last four or five years .

but many european union countries fear that this will force them to give up some of their eight seats on the 24-strong imf executive board , leading to a loss of europe 's global clout . there is less unity within the eu , however , on the suggestions that the 12-nation eurozone should have only one seat on the imf board . support for single vote british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , who heads the imf 's powerful monetary and financial committee , has hinted at such a possibility .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .
the fund supported projects promoting mutual understanding , including renovation of historical sites .
czech concerns over schengen delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers met at the foreign ministry in vienna vondra voiced strong concern that the european union was planning to delay the accession of the czech republic to the schengen area , a zone of the european union where citizens can travel without border checks .
' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .
prague still backs eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing czech prime minister jiri paroubek in prague vondra said the way prague and berlin currently handled their relationship might become a model for co-existence among others in europe , adding : ' ' the new czech government is a pro-european government . "
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .
however , he said in the czech-german declaration from 1997 the two countries promised that they would not force one another into any interpretation of history .
vondra was the main czech negotiator about the declaration . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new czech government may be short-lived after three months of standstill , a new conservative government has been appointed in prague .

another russian tycoon now has a say as to who will play for argentina ’ s national team .
bayern munich 's gm fears a " russianization " of soccer . the influence of money - particularly money from a single patron - in professional soccer is exerting more influence in more unusual ways these days .
the latest headlines in soccer were not about the sale of a club , but rather the sale of rights to determine who can play a squad - and the team was no less than two-time world champion argentina . " i think that ’ s crazy , " bayern munich ’ s outspoken general manager uli hoeness said .
" for me , that is the beginning of the end of soccer . " russian billionaire victor felixovich wexelberg , better known for dealings at urbane art auctions than in sweaty locker rooms , paid 14 million euros -lrb- $ 17.9 million -rrb- for a say as to who the argentine soccer association will select onto the national team .
this is a first in the history of the sport and is a development that disconcerts hoeness . " if the russianization continues then in 10 years , we ’ ll be saying ' nostrovia , so long soccer , " ' he said , referring to russian oil tycoon roman abramovich who owns london club chelsea . e arn money - and attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil provided capital to buy london side chelsea hoeness ' counterpart in bremen , klaus allofs , views the developments in international soccer somewhat more rationally .
he admits that money is changing the world of soccer but that it is hardly a phenomenon that club and association functionaries can change . " you can decry it but soccer is not a world unto itself , " he said in an interview with the german newspaper kreiszeitung . " money from russia or other oil-rich countries is also going elsewhere and it has an effect .
that is a development that we can not stop . " " soccer is simply interesting for people like that , " he added .
" for one , you can earn money .
and also - which is even more important - you can gain attention . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 45 million euros brought andriy shevchenko to chelsea the big money in england , spain , and italy has certainly gained the attention of hoeness .
over the past few months , he has repeatedly said that due to the disproportionate incomes among the larger clubs in europe - either through willing owners pumping exorbitant sums of cash into teams or the fact that television revenues are better outside of germany - bayern munich should have no expectations of winning the champions league , the marquis competition in european club soccer . can solar energy save the sport ? a more equitable redistribution of riches helps keep the bundesliga relatively exciting .
still , in the past nine years , bayern munich has taken the domestic title a total of seven times .
but a return to their powerhouse status of the late 1990 's in the champions league seems less likely . " a new bayern munich era is impossible , " former bayern player stefan effenberg told premiere television .
" they have simply been too disappointing in the champions league the last four or five years .
even if the opponents were top-notch , the only thing that counts is wins . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness believes clean energy can stop " dirty " oil in soccer what might bring the influence of tycoons to an end ?
hoeness thinks that developing alternative energy sources so that oil tycoons do n't have so much cash to throw around is one way . but that alone may not change much because there are other ways to become a billionaire - wexelberg amassed his fortunes on the aluminium and nickel markets . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack leaves munich for chelsea in three-year deal germany national soccer team captain michael ballack has signed a three-year deal to play for english champions chelsea , the club announced on monday .

a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2006 far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs 's political agenda is modelled on hitler 's analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .
a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .

after a terrible start to the season , hanover 96 can celebrate this year 's first victory .
it came with new coach dieter hecking and away to wolfsburg , another struggling team . hanover won the game 2-1 , with all three goals scored in the second half .
of all the players , it was striker thomas brdaric , condemned to the bench by former coach neururer , who was to score both goals for his team and make hecking 's debut as hanover coach a triumph.hanover won the game 2-1 , with all three goals scored in second half .

because of our situation , you could n't assume that we would beat wolfsburg , " hecking told german sports news agency sid .
the coach went on with caution : " it 's all for nothing if the team does n't keep listening and work .
there are still things to improve . " poor game , but at last a victory the lower saxony derby did not blossom with colorful soccer , something not all too surprising when two teams meet who in their combined six games before had not been able to win and had scored a total of three goals . the first half especially was marked by poor passes and a generally sloppy game .
the only real chance in first half came in the 39th minute when brdaric missed the ball after good solo work by jiri stajner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's vinicius and wolfsburg 's moehrle .
hanover came out stronger in second half , perhaps helped by the fans ' banner asking the new coach to bring 96 out of the cellar .
after only six minutes brdaric scored with a beautiful shot , but the guests were not allowed to celebrate for long .
krzynowek scored the equalizer for the home team a minute later and gave most of the 26,000 fans at the volkswagen arena reason to cheer . but it was to be hanover 's day after all , as in the 61st minute brdaric scored his second of the day .
it would prove to be the winner . " even after the equalizer the team did n't fall apart , but instead kept believing in themselves , " a content hecking told sid .

" i do not want to make excuses but the match calendar has certainly not helped , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" i am sure we will find our rhythm soon and not lose games like this . " nuremberg stay top of the table bayern 's loss means fc nuremberg lead the 18-strong bundesliga for the fourth successive week after a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club vfl bochum , jan polak cancelling out theofanis gekas ' early effort for bochum .

" we had a comfortable 2-0 lead and then we stopped putting tackles in , " said a livid bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" now is the time to stop talking and to start taking action . " bremen , who fall to seventh , hoped to get back on the winning trail after a german cup loss to third division pirmasens and a champions league defeat to chelsea .
they lost their star striker miroslav klose through injury shortly before the match but stormed into a two-goal lead with roberto hilbert heading into his own goal and egyptian international mohamed zidan producing a cool finish . but hilbert scored at the right end in the 32nd minute and it sparked a sensational comeback as goals from pavel pardo and luis gomez secured a 3-2 win for the visitors .
" that should not be allowed to happen , " fumed bremen captain frank baumann .
" we just invited the opposition to score goals . " … and hamburg barely keep their heads above water title hopefuls sv hamburg saw their woeful start to the season continue with a 1-0 loss at borussia dortmund .

" i do not want to make excuses but the match calendar has certainly not helped , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" i am sure we will find our rhythm soon and not lose games like this . " nuremberg stay top of the table bayern 's loss means fc nuremberg lead the 18-strong bundesliga for the fourth successive week after a 1-1 draw at home to bottom club vfl bochum , jan polak cancelling out theofanis gekas ' early effort for bochum .
in sunday action , hertha berlin entertain schalke 04 with both sides knowing a win will send them top of the table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's ivan saenko -lrb- l -rrb- challenges for the ball dutch international midfielder marc van bommel , a six million-euro signing from barcelona , put bayern ahead on his debut just six minutes in with a scrambled goal .
and despite continuing to dominate proceedings , felix magath 's side conceded an equalizer on 25 minutes when artur wichniarek ghosted in unmarked at the far post to head in joerg boehme 's free kick . danish dynamite explodes in bayern 's face the goal seemed to inspire the home side and bielefeld nearly went in front six minutes before half-time , but thorben marx 's thumping free kick sailed just over . claudio pizarro almost restored bayern 's lead on the hour mark but his header came back off the woodwork and an increasingly desperate magath sent on hasan salihamidzic and mehmet scholl for bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski in search of a winner . but instead it was bielefeld who scored , jonas kamper firing in an unstoppable shot with seven minutes remaining for a memorable win . " we conceded two goals from set-pieces and that can happen to any team , " said bayern 's german international philipp lahm .
" we did not allow them many chances but we are guilty of not being purposeful enough going forward . " bremen take a dive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen coach thomas schaaf looks all but amused fortunately for bayern , who fell to third in the table , their rivals once again failed to capitalize on their slip with bremen 's miserable run continuing with a 3-2 defeat against vfb stuttgart .
" we had a comfortable 2-0 lead and then we stopped putting tackles in , " said a livid bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" now is the time to stop talking and to start taking action . " bremen , who fall to seventh , hoped to get back on the winning trail after a german cup loss to third division pirmasens and a champions league defeat to chelsea .
they lost their star striker miroslav klose through injury shortly before the match but stormed into a two-goal lead with roberto hilbert heading into his own goal and egyptian international mohamed zidan producing a cool finish . but hilbert scored at the right end in the 32nd minute and it sparked a sensational comeback as goals from pavel pardo and luis gomez secured a 3-2 win for the visitors .
" that should not be allowed to happen , " fumed bremen captain frank baumann .
" we just invited the opposition to score goals . " … and hamburg barely keep their heads above water title hopefuls sv hamburg saw their woeful start to the season continue with a 1-0 loss at borussia dortmund .
" we are wobbling but we just need to keep pushing on and try to win our next match , " declared hamburg boss thomas doll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's philipp degen -lrb- l -rrb- andhamburg 's raphael wicky it was three defeats in a row for hamburg who had lost in the german cup and then to arsenal in the champions league . former german international christian worns scored a late winner for dortmund and hamburg , third last season , now lie fourth from bottom without a win to their name .
dortmund are the big climbers going from ninth to fourth with the win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus ' timo rost -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with mainz ' edu also saturday , newly promoted alemannia aachen celebrated their second win of the season with a 4-2 defeat of borussia moenchengladbach while mainz 05 lost 2-0 at energie cottbus .

now a small college is opening a holocaust institute that also looks at questions of tolerance . there is perhaps no other city more associated with the annihilation of european jewry than berlin , nor any city after the war that has been filled with retribution for the holocaust . there 's the holocaust memorial designed by american architect peter eisenman that consists of 2,711 stone slabs spread over the size of several football fields in the heart of berlin , between the brandenburg gate and the site of hitler 's bunker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect peter eisenman designed the holocaust memorial in central berlin germany 's capital also boosts two museums : architect daniel libeskind 's ultra modern jewish museum , built in the form of a deconstructed star of david ; and the wannsee museum , the villa where the conference on the so-called nazi " final solution " was held .
for the academically inclined , there is the center for anti-semitic research at berlin 's technical university . now the lander institute for the communication of the holocaust and tolerance is to be launched at the touro college in berlin .
its namesake is bernhard lander , a 92-year-old american rabbi , sociology professor and human rights activist , who founded the private university in 1970 . today touro college , which derives its name from isaac touro , a jewish philanthropist in colonial america , is a liberal arts college with campuses in new york , california , israel , russia and germany .

" it 's not just about jews , but about a minority population that is marginalized in our society , " he said .

in the wake of the comments , leaders of the faith demanded apologies , egypt and morocco took diplomatic action , and palestinian gunmen attacked churches . earlier saturday , the head of the roman catholic church said through a representative that his speech had been intended as a rejection of religiously-motivated violence from any side . his holiness regrets ... " the holy father thus sincerely regrets that certain passages of his address could have sounded offensive to the sensitivities of the muslim faithful , and should have been interpreted in a manner that in no way corresponds to his intentions , " vatican secretary of state cardinal tarcisio bertone said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope could not have know at the beginning of his trip what outrage awaited him at the end .
here , his arrival in bavaria " in reiterating his respect and esteem for those who profess islam , he hopes they will be helped to understand the correct meaning of his words ... quickly surmounting this present uneasy moment , " bertone said . benedict 's worst crisis since he was elected in april 2005 was sparked by a speech in his native germany on tuesday that appeared to endorse a christian view , contested by most muslims , that early muslims spread their religion by violence . critics say he appeared to have painted islam in a violent light , particularly with reference to jihad or " holy war . "
in his speech , the pope quoted a 14th-century byzantine emperor who said innovations introduced by the prophet mohammed were " evil and inhuman " . ' not an apology ' as is usually the case with texts of this kind , benedict xvi prepared his address alone and did not show copies to advisors before he gave the speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a rally in jammu , india , on friday against the pope , muslims shouted slogans initial muslim response to the apology was mixed .
british muslim groups welcomed the statement , although one group said it might not be " enough of an apology . " but egypt 's opposition muslim brotherhood said benedict xvi 's statement , " did not constitute an apology . " " the vatican secretary of state says that the pope is sorry because his statements had been badly interpreted , but there is no bad interpretation , " abdel moneim abul futuh , a senior official with the group , told afp news service . diplomatic action the first christian leader to condemn the pope 's comments was the head of egypt 's coptic orthodox church .
coptic pope shenouda iii was apparently unmoved by the vatican 's insistence that the roman catholic leader 's words were misinterpreted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi giving his speech in regensburg , which set off sparks .
meanwhile , egypt 's foreign ministry summoned the vatican 's envoy to cairo on saturday to express egypt 's " extreme regret " at the speech .
egyptian ambassador wafa bassim , who summoned the envoy on the instructions of the foreign minister , said the pope must himself " move quickly to contain the situation . " and morocco announced it was recalling its ambassador to the vatican for consultations in the wake of the " offensive remarks . " attacks on churches after a day of protest in the west bank and gaza strip , palestinian gunmen responded to the pope 's comments by attacking churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope with vatican secretary of state cardinal bertone no one was hurt in a string of fire bombings and shootings that caused no major damage .
five churches came under attack in the west bank city of nablus , where militant groups have long been the dominating force . masked men , who local security officials said were undoubtedly palestinian militants , hurled fire bombs at the anglican and greek orthodox churches . in a second wave of attacks several hours later , palestinian assailants , this time unmasked , poured petrol outside the gates of the roman catholic , greek catholic and protestant churches , starting fires that were swiftly extinguished , witnesses said . appeal from the vatican the roman catholic church 's hierarchy appeared deeply concerned about the seriousness of the crisis the pope 's remarks has sparked .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi referred to the current furor as a " difficult time . " for his part , paul poupard , the french cardinal in charge of inter-religious dialogue at the vatican , called on muslims to read the entire speech and not just the controversial extracts before judging benedict xvi 's words . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslims in uproar over pope 's remarks on islam a wave of muslim outrage swept the globe after pope benedict xvi linked islam with violence , while reactions within germany have been mixed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2006 far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs 's political agenda is modelled on hitler 's analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .
a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists have focused on youth with music cds he says it is particularly important to educate young people , who have been especially targeted by npd campaigns .
since many of them see dim futures for themselves , they are particularly vulnerable to right-wing messages .
" many people there are quite apathetic regarding democracy , " he said .
" they say , ' it does n't solve our problems ' and that is the core of the problem . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german polls bring right-wing into picture again a neo-nazi attack on poll campaign helpers in berlin has highlighted increasingly aggressive campaign tactics by the far-right npd party which hopes to enter parliament in at least one eastern state in looming elections .

" we had a comfortable 2-0 lead and then we stopped putting tackles in , " said a livid bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" now is the time to stop talking and to start taking action . " bremen , who fall to seventh , hoped to get back on the winning trail after a german cup loss to third division pirmasens and a champions league defeat to chelsea .
they lost their star striker miroslav klose through injury shortly before the match but stormed into a two-goal lead with roberto hilbert heading into his own goal and egyptian international mohamed zidan producing a cool finish . but hilbert scored at the right end in the 32nd minute and it sparked a sensational comeback as goals from pavel pardo and luis gomez secured a 3-2 win for the visitors .

but many european union countries fear that this will force them to give up some of their eight seats on the 24-strong imf executive board , leading to a loss of europe 's global clout . there is less unity within the eu , however , on the suggestions that the 12-nation eurozone should have only one seat on the imf board . support for single vote british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , who heads the imf 's powerful monetary and financial committee , has hinted at such a possibility .
britain is not a member of the euro . the proposal also has the backing of euro-group chairman jean-claude juncker who said in helsinki last week that he wanted the euro area to be represented at international meetings by " a single representative . " but steinbrueck insisted in singapore that germany , the largest eurozone member , was opposed to any reduction of the eurozone vote to one seat . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has also said he fully supports " a single representative of the euro area " in international bodies . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf raises prognosis for german economy the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has ramped up its forecast for the german economy .

krzynowek scored the equalizer for the home team a minute later and gave most of the 26,000 fans at the volkswagen arena reason to cheer . but it was to be hanover 's day after all , as in the 61st minute brdaric scored his second of the day .
it would prove to be the winner . " even after the equalizer the team did n't fall apart , but instead kept believing in themselves , " a content hecking told sid .

a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .

winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists have focused on youth with music cds he says it is particularly important to educate young people , who have been especially targeted by npd campaigns .
since many of them see dim futures for themselves , they are particularly vulnerable to right-wing messages .
" many people there are quite apathetic regarding democracy , " he said .

it came with new coach dieter hecking and away to wolfsburg , another struggling team . hanover won the game 2-1 , with all three goals scored in the second half .
of all the players , it was striker thomas brdaric , condemned to the bench by former coach neururer , who was to score both goals for his team and make hecking 's debut as hanover coach a triumph.hanover won the game 2-1 , with all three goals scored in second half .

because of our situation , you could n't assume that we would beat wolfsburg , " hecking told german sports news agency sid .
the coach went on with caution : " it 's all for nothing if the team does n't keep listening and work .
there are still things to improve . " poor game , but at last a victory the lower saxony derby did not blossom with colorful soccer , something not all too surprising when two teams meet who in their combined six games before had not been able to win and had scored a total of three goals . the first half especially was marked by poor passes and a generally sloppy game .
the only real chance in first half came in the 39th minute when brdaric missed the ball after good solo work by jiri stajner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's vinicius and wolfsburg 's moehrle .

there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .

most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .

all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .

the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists have focused on youth with music cds he says it is particularly important to educate young people , who have been especially targeted by npd campaigns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2006 far right finds successful strategy in northeastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo pastörs 's political agenda is modelled on hitler 's analysts predict the far-right npd party will poll over five percent in one state election on sunday and get into the legislature .
a new , clean-cut image and widespread dissatisfaction appear to be a winning formula . the campaign posters along the streets and in town squares look innocent enough .
there are colorful pictures of the german flag , beaming -lrb- usually blond -rrb- children , and words like " home " and " work " on them .
the slogans ­ " working for the people " or " a future instead of the unemployment office " ­ could be on any party 's campaign materials .
but this is not any party ; it 's the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , a political grouping which experts consider xenophobic and anti-semitic , and which models itself largely on adolf hitler 's national socialists , or nazis .
" today , you have a socially engaged face to a racist party , " said hajo funke , a professor at berlin 's free university who specializes in far-right movements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania the npd is likely to gain seats in the state legislature of mecklenburg-western pomerania after sunday 's election , since most analysts think it will surpass the five percent hurdle needed to make it into the statehouse .
most predictions put the percentage at six to seven percent .
" i would n't be surprised if the party got 10 percent of the vote , " said funke .
winning strategy it will likely achieve that thanks to a strategy that has shown itself to be quite successful in this largely rural state of isolated villages and large stretches of enchanting , lake-strewn countryside .
despite the natural beauty , mecklenburg-western pomerania , or meck-pomm for short , is struggling under a crippling unemployment rate of 18.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern states ' economies have suffered since reunification manufacturing , such as traditional industries like shipbuilding , collapsed after reunification and no region in germany has been left as poor as its northeastern corner , or with as high a jobless rate .
while the region is trying to build up its tourism sector and attract other medium-sized industries , it has n't been enough for many of the states 1.8 million residents , many of whom feel they have taken the brunt of reunification without reaping any of its rewards .
all of this together has proven fertile ground for the npd .
" it works because democracy there is weak and the social and economic problems are very serious , " said funke .
make-over the npd has also taken great pains to present a new face to a public , ready for a message that seems to address their own pocketbook problems and frustration .
instead of the traditional neo-nazi uniform of shaved heads , bomber jackets and high-laced boots , the npd in meck-pomm has changed into suits and ties .
they now prefer verbal blows rather than fists , which have been their traditional mode of exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the obligatory look for the npd anymore , at least in meck-pomm " in the last five years , the far right has shed its image as thugs and worked hard to present itself as an acceptable political partner , " according to a march study by the mbt group for democratic culture in meck-pomm .
the npd 's leading candidate in the state is udo pastörs , a 54-year-old jeweler who rails against the left-wing state governing coalition and promises to fight for german jobs and a new minimum wage if his party gets into the legislature .
it 's a message that many people find attractive , especially those in smaller communities or rural areas who feel they have been abandoned by the bigger parties .
if the npd does surpass the five-percent mark , as most expect , it will be the third time a far-right party is represented in an eastern state government .
two years ago , germany was shocked when the npd won 9.2 percent of the vote in saxony .
serious threat ?
still , most agree that the party poses no threat on the national level .
in last september 's federal elections , the npd won just 1.6 percent of the vote .
but according to funke , a victory would still be dangerous , especially in the east , since it would show that the far-right 's current strategy is a winning one in the current climate .
extremist groups in other states could adopt it .
funke says politicians need to educate people about the npd , what it really stands for and show them that its proposed solutions are really no solutions at all .

in the wake of the comments , leaders of the faith demanded apologies , egypt and morocco took diplomatic action , and palestinian gunmen attacked churches . earlier saturday , the head of the roman catholic church said through a representative that his speech had been intended as a rejection of religiously-motivated violence from any side . his holiness regrets ... " the holy father thus sincerely regrets that certain passages of his address could have sounded offensive to the sensitivities of the muslim faithful , and should have been interpreted in a manner that in no way corresponds to his intentions , " vatican secretary of state cardinal tarcisio bertone said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope could not have know at the beginning of his trip what outrage awaited him at the end .

"
in his speech , the pope quoted a 14th-century byzantine emperor who said innovations introduced by the prophet mohammed were " evil and inhuman " . ' not an apology ' as is usually the case with texts of this kind , benedict xvi prepared his address alone and did not show copies to advisors before he gave the speech . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a rally in jammu , india , on friday against the pope , muslims shouted slogans initial muslim response to the apology was mixed .

" " the vatican secretary of state says that the pope is sorry because his statements had been badly interpreted , but there is no bad interpretation , " abdel moneim abul futuh , a senior official with the group , told afp news service . diplomatic action the first christian leader to condemn the pope 's comments was the head of egypt 's coptic orthodox church .

meanwhile , egypt 's foreign ministry summoned the vatican 's envoy to cairo on saturday to express egypt 's " extreme regret " at the speech .
egyptian ambassador wafa bassim , who summoned the envoy on the instructions of the foreign minister , said the pope must himself " move quickly to contain the situation . " and morocco announced it was recalling its ambassador to the vatican for consultations in the wake of the " offensive remarks . " attacks on churches after a day of protest in the west bank and gaza strip , palestinian gunmen responded to the pope 's comments by attacking churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope with vatican secretary of state cardinal bertone no one was hurt in a string of fire bombings and shootings that caused no major damage .
five churches came under attack in the west bank city of nablus , where militant groups have long been the dominating force . masked men , who local security officials said were undoubtedly palestinian militants , hurled fire bombs at the anglican and greek orthodox churches . in a second wave of attacks several hours later , palestinian assailants , this time unmasked , poured petrol outside the gates of the roman catholic , greek catholic and protestant churches , starting fires that were swiftly extinguished , witnesses said . appeal from the vatican the roman catholic church 's hierarchy appeared deeply concerned about the seriousness of the crisis the pope 's remarks has sparked .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi referred to the current furor as a " difficult time . " for his part , paul poupard , the french cardinal in charge of inter-religious dialogue at the vatican , called on muslims to read the entire speech and not just the controversial extracts before judging benedict xvi 's words . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslims in uproar over pope 's remarks on islam a wave of muslim outrage swept the globe after pope benedict xvi linked islam with violence , while reactions within germany have been mixed .

" we had a comfortable 2-0 lead and then we stopped putting tackles in , " said a livid bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" now is the time to stop talking and to start taking action . " bremen , who fall to seventh , hoped to get back on the winning trail after a german cup loss to third division pirmasens and a champions league defeat to chelsea .
they lost their star striker miroslav klose through injury shortly before the match but stormed into a two-goal lead with roberto hilbert heading into his own goal and egyptian international mohamed zidan producing a cool finish . but hilbert scored at the right end in the 32nd minute and it sparked a sensational comeback as goals from pavel pardo and luis gomez secured a 3-2 win for the visitors .
" that should not be allowed to happen , " fumed bremen captain frank baumann .
" we just invited the opposition to score goals . " … and hamburg barely keep their heads above water title hopefuls sv hamburg saw their woeful start to the season continue with a 1-0 loss at borussia dortmund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.09.2006 german , czech ministers want to extend reconciliation fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandr vondra and frank-walter steinmeier discussed the future fund at the meeting newly appointed czech foreign minister alexandr vondra visited his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier last week to discuss extending financing for reconciliation projects . earlier this week , vondra visited berlin to talk about extending the " fund for the future ' .
praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .
the fund supported projects promoting mutual understanding , including renovation of historical sites .
czech concerns over schengen delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers met at the foreign ministry in vienna vondra voiced strong concern that the european union was planning to delay the accession of the czech republic to the schengen area , a zone of the european union where citizens can travel without border checks .
' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .
prague still backs eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing czech prime minister jiri paroubek in prague vondra said the way prague and berlin currently handled their relationship might become a model for co-existence among others in europe , adding : ' ' the new czech government is a pro-european government . "
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .
however , he said in the czech-german declaration from 1997 the two countries promised that they would not force one another into any interpretation of history .
vondra was the main czech negotiator about the declaration . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new czech government may be short-lived after three months of standstill , a new conservative government has been appointed in prague .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.09.2006 russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a warning from uli hoeness who fears excessively wealthy tycoons three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .
another russian tycoon now has a say as to who will play for argentina ’ s national team .
bayern munich 's gm fears a " russianization " of soccer . the influence of money - particularly money from a single patron - in professional soccer is exerting more influence in more unusual ways these days .
the latest headlines in soccer were not about the sale of a club , but rather the sale of rights to determine who can play a squad - and the team was no less than two-time world champion argentina . " i think that ’ s crazy , " bayern munich ’ s outspoken general manager uli hoeness said .
" for me , that is the beginning of the end of soccer . " russian billionaire victor felixovich wexelberg , better known for dealings at urbane art auctions than in sweaty locker rooms , paid 14 million euros -lrb- $ 17.9 million -rrb- for a say as to who the argentine soccer association will select onto the national team .
this is a first in the history of the sport and is a development that disconcerts hoeness . " if the russianization continues then in 10 years , we ’ ll be saying ' nostrovia , so long soccer , " ' he said , referring to russian oil tycoon roman abramovich who owns london club chelsea . e arn money - and attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil provided capital to buy london side chelsea hoeness ' counterpart in bremen , klaus allofs , views the developments in international soccer somewhat more rationally .
he admits that money is changing the world of soccer but that it is hardly a phenomenon that club and association functionaries can change . " you can decry it but soccer is not a world unto itself , " he said in an interview with the german newspaper kreiszeitung . " money from russia or other oil-rich countries is also going elsewhere and it has an effect .
that is a development that we can not stop . " " soccer is simply interesting for people like that , " he added .
" for one , you can earn money .
and also - which is even more important - you can gain attention . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 45 million euros brought andriy shevchenko to chelsea the big money in england , spain , and italy has certainly gained the attention of hoeness .
over the past few months , he has repeatedly said that due to the disproportionate incomes among the larger clubs in europe - either through willing owners pumping exorbitant sums of cash into teams or the fact that television revenues are better outside of germany - bayern munich should have no expectations of winning the champions league , the marquis competition in european club soccer . can solar energy save the sport ? a more equitable redistribution of riches helps keep the bundesliga relatively exciting .
still , in the past nine years , bayern munich has taken the domestic title a total of seven times .
but a return to their powerhouse status of the late 1990 's in the champions league seems less likely . " a new bayern munich era is impossible , " former bayern player stefan effenberg told premiere television .
" they have simply been too disappointing in the champions league the last four or five years .
even if the opponents were top-notch , the only thing that counts is wins . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness believes clean energy can stop " dirty " oil in soccer what might bring the influence of tycoons to an end ?
hoeness thinks that developing alternative energy sources so that oil tycoons do n't have so much cash to throw around is one way . but that alone may not change much because there are other ways to become a billionaire - wexelberg amassed his fortunes on the aluminium and nickel markets . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack leaves munich for chelsea in three-year deal germany national soccer team captain michael ballack has signed a three-year deal to play for english champions chelsea , the club announced on monday .
-lrb- may 17 , 2006 -rrb- some soccer fans want to reclaim the game the world cup , which starts friday , will be the culmination of two years of hype that has left no marketing stone unturned .
for " true " fans , it has become capitalistic excess and some are rebelling .

praising prague for avoiding the sort of friction that has arisen in recent months in polish-german relations , steinmeier said some 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25 million -rrb- would be needed to extend the term of the bilateral fund beyond its 2007 expiry date .
the fund was created in 1997 to back projects that help reconcile czechs and germans , easing suspicions and resentments dating back to the nazi invasion , the second world war and the expulsion of ethnic germans in the subsequent years .
' ' we 'll be seeking backing so that the fund is financed as required , " said steinmeier .
the fund supported projects promoting mutual understanding , including renovation of historical sites .
czech concerns over schengen delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers met at the foreign ministry in vienna vondra voiced strong concern that the european union was planning to delay the accession of the czech republic to the schengen area , a zone of the european union where citizens can travel without border checks .
' ' we are not happy about it and we want an explanation , " he said .
' ' our people want open borders . "
he saw the justification coming from the eu - that schengen area can not be extended on time because of technical reasons - as unsatisfactory .
vondra said the investments made by the czech republic in the sis 2 computer system and the postponement of schengen are not positive signs for eu citizens waiting for the border checks , according to czech internet news site ceskenoviny.cz .
prague still backs eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing czech prime minister jiri paroubek in prague vondra said the way prague and berlin currently handled their relationship might become a model for co-existence among others in europe , adding : ' ' the new czech government is a pro-european government . "
prague backed ' ' openness " in europe .
steinmeier said he wished german-polish relations were similarly open and could be managed with ' ' risks of escalation , " but at the moment there was friction .
germany and the czech republic had based their relationship on a conviction that the evils of the past could not be forgotten , but that the past also ought not to be obstacle to the future , the german minister said .
steinmeier said he would discuss the issue with interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the european commission has planned to extend the schengen area by the end of 2007 , but now the ec admits the preparations are not proceeding according to schedule .
it says checks at inner borders of the new eu countries would not be cancelled before 2008 .
expulsion center attracts controversy czech newspaper the prague daily monitor said vondra voiced concerns over the proposed establishment of a " center against expulsions , " which the german association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- reportedly want to set up in berlin .
some czech and polish politicians said they fear expellees might overly-emphasize the suffering of germans deported from the czech republic and poland after world war two .
vondra said he considered plans to establish the center unfortunate .
however , he said in the czech-german declaration from 1997 the two countries promised that they would not force one another into any interpretation of history .
vondra was the main czech negotiator about the declaration . dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new czech government may be short-lived after three months of standstill , a new conservative government has been appointed in prague .

the east of england development agency -lrb- eeda -rrb- has appointed sustainable homes advisor faber maunsell to oversee its new project in great yarmouth , norfolk .
a development at saul 's wharf , cobholm , will include energy-efficient apartments , shops and a creche area .
the scheme is part of a regeneration scheme in great yarmouth and lowestoft .
features to maximise energy efficiency and reduce unwanted emissions are included in the design prepared by architects , on behalf of eeda .
' kick start regeneration ' outline plans for the scheme were approved by great yarmouth borough council earlier this year .
eeda said : " this landmark development on the great yarmouth waterfront will be one of the first projects to take shape within the 1st east urban regeneration area in lowestoft and great yarmouth .
george bennett , eeda 's regional renaissance manager , said : " this innovative development is designed to have low energy needs and low emissions .
" it is the first of eeda 's planned housing demonstrator schemes and once built it will act as an example to all those working in the construction and engineering industry in the region on how to build high quality , sustainable and environmentally friendly homes and buildings .
" it will also help to kick start the wider regeneration of this deprived area of great yarmouth . "

the world development report says there are now a record 1.3 billion people aged 12-24 living around the world .
those numbers could create problems in many nations if societies do not adapt , world bank officials warn .
although the number of young in primary education is rising , the report says some 130 million can not read or write .
young people are thought to make up about half the world 's unemployed , the report says .
it also estimates that about 100 million new jobs need to be created in the middle east and across north africa before 2020 to cope with the numbers of young people seeking work .
' window of opportunity ' the report analyses the development of young people in terms of five key " transitions " .
world development report most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader managing those transitions - learning , working , growing up healthy , forming families and exercising citizenship - will require continued investment by governments and the creation of an environment for young people and their families to flourish , world bank president paul wolfowitz writes in the report .
the bank 's chief economist , francois bourguignon , attending the annual meeting of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank , in singapore , said governments around the world had a " demographic window of opportunity " .
" it is far easier to develop skills during youth , " mr bourguignon said .
" if we fail to do that , it will be impossible to remedy the missed opportunity .
it is fundamental to invest in youth . "
according to figures in the report , the " demographic window " varies from country to country : in industrialised states such as japan and italy it closed about 10 years ago .
china has just a few years of its window still remaining , the bank estimates , but india , with a younger population , still has 30 years .
second chances the report identifies failings in vital areas such as education and the development of key skills .
while most children in indonesia attend school for six years , with 80 % completing primary education , the numbers in secondary education are considerably smaller .
in many parts of africa initial enrolment rates are lower , and access to education for girls is more of a problem .
poor education and a lack of skills were cited by employers in countries as far apart as algeria , brazil , bangladesh , brazil , china , estonia and zambia , the report says .
health issues are also a major concern , with hiv / aids and the spread of other sexually-transmitted diseased cited as a key problem .
governments should plan ahead in order to offer the young the best opportunities to develop their capabilities and family life , the report says .
those whose take bad decisions or bad luck should be offered second chances , it adds , as a denial of opportunities can have long-term implications .

sir richard leese told campaign group military families against the war its albert square camp was unacceptable on health and safety grounds .
the council leader said the authority had a " proud record " of supporting protest and had opposed the iraq war .
but spokeswoman rose gentle said the group would defy council objections .
campaigners wanted to erect tents in front of the town hall to coincide with the labour party conference , which starts at the nearby g-mex centre on 22 september .
war protest but a request from about 20 people was rejected by manchester city council on health and safety grounds .
in a letter to the group , sir richard said : " we have been liaising fully with organisers of the ' stop the war ' march to be held in manchester on september 23 , to the extent that they will be using our stage .
" indeed one of the reasons for rejecting your request to a camp in albert square is that we will need to be erecting that very staging .
i am preparing to spend three days in a tent to try and make people think about the realities for all of us pam heywood , campaigner read a campaigner 's thoughts " we have also , with the police , identified a location close to the convention centre , where people will be able to visibly and audibly make their protests throughout the period of the conference .
" we would like you to be reasonable in identifying a compromise that would be acceptable to us on health and safety and public liability grounds , and still allows you to exercise your right to protest . "
but mrs gentle , whose son gordon died in iraq in 2004 , said the council had ignored them until the media picked up the story .
" we do n't see why we ca n't do it ... when we 've been asking them for weeks , " she said .
mrs gentle said some members of the group had written to the council in june , outlining plans to bring special tents and their own portable toilets .
" they never acknowledged us until we went for a meeting with the police , " she added .
" we 're going to carry on protesting . "
about 17,000 extra visitors are expected to begin arriving in the city from 22 september for the five-day conference .
the home office has given greater manchester police £ 4.2m to police the conference .

sir richard leese told campaign group military families against the war its albert square camp was unacceptable on health and safety grounds .
the council leader said the authority had a " proud record " of supporting protest and had opposed the iraq war .
but spokeswoman rose gentle said the group would defy council objections .
campaigners wanted to erect tents in front of the town hall to coincide with the labour party conference , which starts at the nearby g-mex centre on 22 september .
war protest but a request from about 20 people was rejected by manchester city council on health and safety grounds .
in a letter to the group , sir richard said : " we have been liaising fully with organisers of the ' stop the war ' march to be held in manchester on september 23 , to the extent that they will be using our stage .
" indeed one of the reasons for rejecting your request to a camp in albert square is that we will need to be erecting that very staging .

" we would like you to be reasonable in identifying a compromise that would be acceptable to us on health and safety and public liability grounds , and still allows you to exercise your right to protest . "
but mrs gentle , whose son gordon died in iraq in 2004 , said the council had ignored them until the media picked up the story .
" we do n't see why we ca n't do it ... when we 've been asking them for weeks , " she said .
mrs gentle said some members of the group had written to the council in june , outlining plans to bring special tents and their own portable toilets .
" they never acknowledged us until we went for a meeting with the police , " she added .
" we 're going to carry on protesting . "
about 17,000 extra visitors are expected to begin arriving in the city from 22 september for the five-day conference .
the home office has given greater manchester police £ 4.2m to police the conference .

up to 20 prison officers at winson green jail in birmingham were involved in a row over overtime payments .
the prison officers association -lrb- poa -rrb- said officers there were told to do more hours because of a staff shortage .
the prison service has obtained a high court injunction ordering unions to remove a circular which advised members not to work outside their shifts .
the injunction will stay in place until a full court hearing next friday .
' fewer rights ' the poa chairman , colin moses , criticised the government for taking legal action .
he said : " we are looking after the most difficult people in society and the prison population has increased massively since labour came to power .
" but we seem to have fewer rights than the prisoners .

up to 20 prison officers at winson green jail in birmingham were involved in a row over overtime payments .
the prison officers association -lrb- poa -rrb- said officers there were told to do more hours because of a staff shortage .
the prison service has obtained a high court injunction ordering unions to remove a circular which advised members not to work outside their shifts .
the injunction will stay in place until a full court hearing next friday .
' fewer rights ' the poa chairman , colin moses , criticised the government for taking legal action .
he said : " we are looking after the most difficult people in society and the prison population has increased massively since labour came to power .
" but we seem to have fewer rights than the prisoners .
" our members are right to refuse not to work outside their shifts because prisons are being run without the proper number of staff . "
