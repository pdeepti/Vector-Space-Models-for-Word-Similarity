or just a sad swan song ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black swan spends its time daydreaming about the white love bird -lrb- no , boat ! -rrb- in the back it may sound a little kinky , but even swans have their fetishes .
for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place . " she said the swan 's chances for survival are good , despite losing its " life partner , " as long as it gets enough food and water . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " get a taste of dw-world.de 's quirky stories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany supports imf reforms but harbors concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf aims to support economic growth , especially in crisis areas the imf and the world bank decided at their annual conference in singapore to give four member states more say and increase anti-corruption efforts in developing countries .
germany agrees - with some reservations . the international monetary fund and the world bank on monday raised the contribution quotas of china , south korea , mexico and turkey by a total of 1.8 percent in recognition of recent economic development there .
quotas for other countries in the 184-member organization were reduced accordingly . german finance minister peer steinbrück called the decision , approved with 90.6 percent of the vote , a " very good result . "
he also said that he considers germany underrepresented . as part of the agreement , germany 's quota was reduced by 0.1 percent , putting it at just under 6 percent .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter .

" merkel declined to comment on recent criticism from germany 's eastern european neighbors , where many of the german expellees lived before hitler rose to power .
she insisted , howevver , that the underlying cause of the suffering of world war ii - germany 's nazi regime - could not be forgotten . she said , however , that an appropriate place in berlin should be found for the proposed " center against expulsions . " " -lrb- the center -rrb- should send the signal that every form of expulsion and ethnic cleansing in europe and the world should be banned , " merkel said at the ceremony held by her christian democrats and their sister party , the bavaria-only christian social union in berlin . " … germa n s n ever would have bee n expelled after 1945 " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski trying to ease tensions this month " without the nazis and the immeasurable crimes , suffering and destruction that they brought about , the germans never would have been expelled after 1945 , " merkel said . plans to build the berlin-based center to commemorate an estimated 12.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled from or fled poland , then-czechoslovakia and elsewhere when the third reich collapsed have been bitterly disputed . poland 's conservative government and many poles are against the center , as they believe it aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
the polish government has claimed that germany is trying to rewrite history . tensions between neighboring germany and poland recently prompted polish prime minister jaroslaw kacynski to threaten special minority protections for ethnic germans still living in poland . despite continuing critcism from warsaw , however , german president horst köhler recently told the german association of deportees that the world must be assured that germans do not want to rewrite history . " there is no doubt that the responsibility for the expulsions lies with the criminal nazi regime and world war ii , which was started by germany , " he said . " o n goi n g phe n ome n o n " german chancellor merkel has also said that the center would not be limited to german deportees following world war ii , commenting that there would be a focus on european expellees throughout the last century . she pointed to the ethnic cleansing that occurred not long ago in the former yugoslavia and the current crisis in the darfur region of sudan , where hundreds of thousands of people have been expelled from their homeland , as evidence of the " ongoing phenomenon " of expulsion . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german , czech ministers want to extend reconciliation fund newly appointed czech foreign minister alexandr vondra visited his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier last week to discuss extending financing for reconciliation projects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .
in eastern germany , this strategy has borne fruit . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .
in eastern germany , this strategy has borne fruit . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells .

it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place . " she said the swan 's chances for survival are good , despite losing its " life partner , " as long as it gets enough food and water . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " get a taste of dw-world.de 's quirky stories .

" we have to decide whether we 're going to close the books in germany for this technology , " thyssenkrupp ceo olaf berlien said over the weekend in greece . row over tra n srapid li n k i n mu n ich at the heart of the row is the failure of the german federal government as well as bavaria 's regional government to reach agreement over the financing of the around 36-kilometer -lrb- 22.4 miles -rrb- long transrapid route between the munich railway station and the city 's airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel walks to aboard the transrapid in shanghai berlien has said that the future of the transrapid now depends on progress of the possible transrapid link in munich , which has been discussed for several years now . a link in munich could generate additional sales of around 400 million euros -lrb- $ 506 million -rrb- a year for thyssenkrupp .
this compares with required investments of some 1.8 billion euros , which thyssenkrupp says should be paid for by the state . chi n a could sta n d to wi n berlien made it clear over the weekend that thyssenkrupp , which developed the transrapid train together with siemens , is serious about making good on its threat . " in 18 months thyssenkrupp will decide whether the technology will go to china , " berlien said .
" the transrapid will then be a german-chinese project which would mean a technology transfer to china . " he added that the deal would involve either selling the technology to china , founding a joint venture in china or setting up a distribution or marketing partnership with a chinese firm . the only functioning transrapid train worldwide currently is in the chinese metropolis of shanghai , where it links the financial district , pudong , with the airport .
called the maglev line , the train travels up to 430 kilometers per hour . thyssenkrupp argues that the transrapid train can only be sold outside of germany when a domestic route for the high-tech train is realized .
both the us and the gulf nation of qatar have also signaled interest in the train . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has already begun work on its maglev lines " if the link in munich does n't become reality , thyssenkrupp and siemens will be unable to further develop the -lrb- transrapid -rrb- technology , " berlien said , adding that chinese competition will have developed similar cutting-edge technology within the next five to seven years .
" i hope for the sake of germany 's image as a business location , that we manage to do it ourselves , " berlien said . the federal ministry for transport has already said that it will work towards a speedy decision on the transrapid link in munich . " at some poi n t you have to get serious " thyssenkrupp , germany 's largest steelmaker , has pointed out that the magnetic levitation train does n't play an important role for the company , saying that its annual revenues of 110 million euros is just a " homeopathic dose . " however , thyssenkrupp has indicated that the ongoing tussle may end up hurting germany 's image in the long term . berlien said that germany often witnessed long debates over the use of innovative technologies . " our mentality in germany is to look for the fly in the ointment , " berlien said , adding that " at some point you have to get serious .

" we have to decide whether we 're going to close the books in germany for this technology , " thyssenkrupp ceo olaf berlien said over the weekend in greece . row over tra n srapid li n k i n mu n ich at the heart of the row is the failure of the german federal government as well as bavaria 's regional government to reach agreement over the financing of the around 36-kilometer -lrb- 22.4 miles -rrb- long transrapid route between the munich railway station and the city 's airport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel walks to aboard the transrapid in shanghai berlien has said that the future of the transrapid now depends on progress of the possible transrapid link in munich , which has been discussed for several years now . a link in munich could generate additional sales of around 400 million euros -lrb- $ 506 million -rrb- a year for thyssenkrupp .
this compares with required investments of some 1.8 billion euros , which thyssenkrupp says should be paid for by the state . chi n a could sta n d to wi n berlien made it clear over the weekend that thyssenkrupp , which developed the transrapid train together with siemens , is serious about making good on its threat . " in 18 months thyssenkrupp will decide whether the technology will go to china , " berlien said .
" the transrapid will then be a german-chinese project which would mean a technology transfer to china . " he added that the deal would involve either selling the technology to china , founding a joint venture in china or setting up a distribution or marketing partnership with a chinese firm . the only functioning transrapid train worldwide currently is in the chinese metropolis of shanghai , where it links the financial district , pudong , with the airport .
called the maglev line , the train travels up to 430 kilometers per hour . thyssenkrupp argues that the transrapid train can only be sold outside of germany when a domestic route for the high-tech train is realized .
both the us and the gulf nation of qatar have also signaled interest in the train . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has already begun work on its maglev lines " if the link in munich does n't become reality , thyssenkrupp and siemens will be unable to further develop the -lrb- transrapid -rrb- technology , " berlien said , adding that chinese competition will have developed similar cutting-edge technology within the next five to seven years .
" i hope for the sake of germany 's image as a business location , that we manage to do it ourselves , " berlien said . the federal ministry for transport has already said that it will work towards a speedy decision on the transrapid link in munich . " at some poi n t you have to get serious " thyssenkrupp , germany 's largest steelmaker , has pointed out that the magnetic levitation train does n't play an important role for the company , saying that its annual revenues of 110 million euros is just a " homeopathic dose . " however , thyssenkrupp has indicated that the ongoing tussle may end up hurting germany 's image in the long term . berlien said that germany often witnessed long debates over the use of innovative technologies . " our mentality in germany is to look for the fly in the ointment , " berlien said , adding that " at some point you have to get serious .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .
now in its 173rd year , it is the world 's biggest festival .
its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single . " not surprisingly , american accents were everywhere among the international crowd , though not enough to please the lame tourist overheard whining " why do n't they all speak english ?
it would make my life so much easier . " the real fun appears to be inside the 14 beer tents , though we had to get there early and stake out a table for several hours before the beer and band showed up . once they did , it did n't take long for me to become certain that i had perfected the drinking songs , though my german is n't great and my singing voice is even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buy one of these for your sweetie who loses at oktoberfest ? my deepest sympathies do go to the waiters , who managed to carry a precarious pyramid of steins down the aisles while shoving aside me and my camera ; the poor souls who had to clean the place ; and anyone who for whatever reason was n't drinking . oktoberfest was always something i wanted to have been to , yet was n't sure i actually wanted to go to .
but i absolutely would return .
of course , this might be because i followed the advice to leave while everyone was happy and before the beer stopped flowing . i do , however , somewhat regret that i left without a dirndl . in this new occasional series , " postcard from germany , " dw-world.de offers you snapshots of places around the country .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .

for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .
now in its 173rd year , it is the world 's biggest festival .
its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single . " not surprisingly , american accents were everywhere among the international crowd , though not enough to please the lame tourist overheard whining " why do n't they all speak english ?
it would make my life so much easier . " the real fun appears to be inside the 14 beer tents , though we had to get there early and stake out a table for several hours before the beer and band showed up . once they did , it did n't take long for me to become certain that i had perfected the drinking songs , though my german is n't great and my singing voice is even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buy one of these for your sweetie who loses at oktoberfest ? my deepest sympathies do go to the waiters , who managed to carry a precarious pyramid of steins down the aisles while shoving aside me and my camera ; the poor souls who had to clean the place ; and anyone who for whatever reason was n't drinking . oktoberfest was always something i wanted to have been to , yet was n't sure i actually wanted to go to .
but i absolutely would return .
of course , this might be because i followed the advice to leave while everyone was happy and before the beer stopped flowing . i do , however , somewhat regret that i left without a dirndl . in this new occasional series , " postcard from germany , " dw-world.de offers you snapshots of places around the country .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .
in eastern germany , this strategy has borne fruit . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now .

" most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .

in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

" we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .
" this is our heritage .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .
the two brands would pursue jointly expansion in growing markets such as china . will man raise offer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is hoping to be a european market leader with the takeover of scania shares in man sank on the frankfurt stock exchange , closing down 5.30 percent at 60.61 euros . analysts said the fall was because of fears the german group might be tempted to significantly improve its offer .
man needs to win 90 percent of the voting rights in scania for the takeover to succeed . " people are absolutely speculating on a higher bid .
another conclusion can not be drawn , " said analyst anders bruzelius at swedbank in stockholm . the wallenberg investment group , which controls 29 percent of the company , issued a statement through its investor subsidiary saying that the offer " did not reflect the fair value and potential of scania . " volkswagen , the biggest shareholder in scania with 34.32 percent of the voting rights and 18.7 percent of the share capital , also rejected the bid . the german group said its stake in the swedish truck maker was of " strategic character " and that it was not in its " industrial interest " to sell . man said that it had signed an agreement with french group renault to buy renault 's holding of 2.85 percent in scania .
renault owns 5.18 percent of the votes in scania . man would be n umber two with sca n ia daimlerchrysler is currently the biggest maker of trucks in europe , followed by the combined businesses of volvo and renault , according to data compiled by the acea european automobile manufacturers association . man ranks number three , but with scania it would leapfrog the other two to take the number one spot . man said it hoped to achieve cost savings of at least 500 million euros a year with the full benefits becoming effective three years after a deal .
no factory closures were planned . the headquarters of a merged group would be in munich in southern germany , but important management functions would remain in sweden . man , which makes trucks of more than six tons , employs about 80,000 people and has annual sales of 18.5 billion euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former shareholders win compensation from daimlerchrysler a stuttgart court ordered german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler to pay 232 million euros -lrb- $ 299 million -rrb- to former shareholders of daimler-benz in a legal battle over terms of its 1998 merger with us carmaker chrysler .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .
now in its 173rd year , it is the world 's biggest festival .
its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single . " not surprisingly , american accents were everywhere among the international crowd , though not enough to please the lame tourist overheard whining " why do n't they all speak english ?
it would make my life so much easier . " the real fun appears to be inside the 14 beer tents , though we had to get there early and stake out a table for several hours before the beer and band showed up . once they did , it did n't take long for me to become certain that i had perfected the drinking songs , though my german is n't great and my singing voice is even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buy one of these for your sweetie who loses at oktoberfest ? my deepest sympathies do go to the waiters , who managed to carry a precarious pyramid of steins down the aisles while shoving aside me and my camera ; the poor souls who had to clean the place ; and anyone who for whatever reason was n't drinking . oktoberfest was always something i wanted to have been to , yet was n't sure i actually wanted to go to .
but i absolutely would return .
of course , this might be because i followed the advice to leave while everyone was happy and before the beer stopped flowing . i do , however , somewhat regret that i left without a dirndl . in this new occasional series , " postcard from germany , " dw-world.de offers you snapshots of places around the country .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .

man needs to win 90 percent of the voting rights in scania for the takeover to succeed . " people are absolutely speculating on a higher bid .
another conclusion can not be drawn , " said analyst anders bruzelius at swedbank in stockholm . the wallenberg investment group , which controls 29 percent of the company , issued a statement through its investor subsidiary saying that the offer " did not reflect the fair value and potential of scania . " volkswagen , the biggest shareholder in scania with 34.32 percent of the voting rights and 18.7 percent of the share capital , also rejected the bid . the german group said its stake in the swedish truck maker was of " strategic character " and that it was not in its " industrial interest " to sell . man said that it had signed an agreement with french group renault to buy renault 's holding of 2.85 percent in scania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .

the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .
in eastern germany , this strategy has borne fruit . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : alarm bells ring over support for far right after the far-right national democratic party took 7.3 percent of the vote in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the german press started ringing alarm bells .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .

for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .

" most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 chancellor merkel wants center to commemorate deportees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ways to reconciliation , " reads the sign behind merkel despite strong criticism from poland , german chancellor angela merkel supports the creation of a permanent institution in berlin to commemorate the world ’ s deportees , including millions of german expellees after 1945 . german chancellor angela merkel expressed support monday for a permanent center documenting the plight of germans forced from their homes after world war ii and other victims of expulsions , adding she hoped for help from european neighbors . the chancellor was attending an anniversary gathering in berlin entitled " 60 years of deportation - 60 years of paths to reconciliation . " merkel declined to comment on recent criticism from germany 's eastern european neighbors , where many of the german expellees lived before hitler rose to power .
she insisted , howevver , that the underlying cause of the suffering of world war ii - germany 's nazi regime - could not be forgotten . she said , however , that an appropriate place in berlin should be found for the proposed " center against expulsions . " " -lrb- the center -rrb- should send the signal that every form of expulsion and ethnic cleansing in europe and the world should be banned , " merkel said at the ceremony held by her christian democrats and their sister party , the bavaria-only christian social union in berlin . " … germa n s n ever would have bee n expelled after 1945 " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski trying to ease tensions this month " without the nazis and the immeasurable crimes , suffering and destruction that they brought about , the germans never would have been expelled after 1945 , " merkel said . plans to build the berlin-based center to commemorate an estimated 12.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled from or fled poland , then-czechoslovakia and elsewhere when the third reich collapsed have been bitterly disputed . poland 's conservative government and many poles are against the center , as they believe it aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .

quotas for other countries in the 184-member organization were reduced accordingly . german finance minister peer steinbrück called the decision , approved with 90.6 percent of the vote , a " very good result . "
he also said that he considers germany underrepresented . as part of the agreement , germany 's quota was reduced by 0.1 percent , putting it at just under 6 percent .
the us , with 17 percent , remains the most strongly represented country in the group . steinbrück wants equality for eu countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück met with singapore 's pm lee hsien loong at the imf-world bank conference " the principle of equal treatment and fair burden distribution should be strictly applied to all imf members , " said steinbrück , adding that the risks associated with the imf 's planned quota reforms should be taken into account . in the most widely reaching reforms in its 60 year history , the imf is planning additional quota changes over the next two years .
india , egypt , brazil and argentina are also candidates for higher quotas due to economic progress in their countries . quotas are currently a factor of the economic strength of the member country and determine both its financial contribution to the imf and its say in decision-making processes . in a speech tuesday in singapore , steinbrück said germany would remain closely involved in the reform process .
he also reiterated germany 's position that economic openness and a country 's degree of integration into the global economy be added to the quota criteria . anti-corruption strategy passed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say world bank loans contribute to former chilean dictator pinochet 's success in addition to quota adjustments for member states , a controversial anti-corruption strategy was approved at the imf-world bank conference .
loan programs and other world bank projects in developing countries are to be scrutinized more closely . according to the new strategy , funds can be suspended or revoked if the government of the recipient country does not make adequate attempts to hinder corruption . " we have to make sure that money is spent on text books and medicine and does n't end up in the pockets of those in power , " said world bank president paul wolfowitz . some development organizations , however , are concerned that the new approach may be too stringent . " the bank 's strategy does n't work when it 's used to deny loans or demand privatization , " said representatives from the development organization oxfam . the world bank estimates that $ 1 billion -lrb- 790 million euros -rrb- are lost each year to corruption . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opposes single voice for euro countries at imf german finance minister peer steinbrück ruled out suggestions that the eurozone nations should have only one seat on the board of the international monetary fund .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .
the two brands would pursue jointly expansion in growing markets such as china . will man raise offer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is hoping to be a european market leader with the takeover of scania shares in man sank on the frankfurt stock exchange , closing down 5.30 percent at 60.61 euros . analysts said the fall was because of fears the german group might be tempted to significantly improve its offer .
man needs to win 90 percent of the voting rights in scania for the takeover to succeed . " people are absolutely speculating on a higher bid .
another conclusion can not be drawn , " said analyst anders bruzelius at swedbank in stockholm . the wallenberg investment group , which controls 29 percent of the company , issued a statement through its investor subsidiary saying that the offer " did not reflect the fair value and potential of scania . " volkswagen , the biggest shareholder in scania with 34.32 percent of the voting rights and 18.7 percent of the share capital , also rejected the bid . the german group said its stake in the swedish truck maker was of " strategic character " and that it was not in its " industrial interest " to sell . man said that it had signed an agreement with french group renault to buy renault 's holding of 2.85 percent in scania .
renault owns 5.18 percent of the votes in scania . man would be n umber two with sca n ia daimlerchrysler is currently the biggest maker of trucks in europe , followed by the combined businesses of volvo and renault , according to data compiled by the acea european automobile manufacturers association . man ranks number three , but with scania it would leapfrog the other two to take the number one spot . man said it hoped to achieve cost savings of at least 500 million euros a year with the full benefits becoming effective three years after a deal .
no factory closures were planned . the headquarters of a merged group would be in munich in southern germany , but important management functions would remain in sweden . man , which makes trucks of more than six tons , employs about 80,000 people and has annual sales of 18.5 billion euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former shareholders win compensation from daimlerchrysler a stuttgart court ordered german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler to pay 232 million euros -lrb- $ 299 million -rrb- to former shareholders of daimler-benz in a legal battle over terms of its 1998 merger with us carmaker chrysler .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .

for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .
the two brands would pursue jointly expansion in growing markets such as china . will man raise offer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man is hoping to be a european market leader with the takeover of scania shares in man sank on the frankfurt stock exchange , closing down 5.30 percent at 60.61 euros . analysts said the fall was because of fears the german group might be tempted to significantly improve its offer .
man needs to win 90 percent of the voting rights in scania for the takeover to succeed . " people are absolutely speculating on a higher bid .
another conclusion can not be drawn , " said analyst anders bruzelius at swedbank in stockholm . the wallenberg investment group , which controls 29 percent of the company , issued a statement through its investor subsidiary saying that the offer " did not reflect the fair value and potential of scania . " volkswagen , the biggest shareholder in scania with 34.32 percent of the voting rights and 18.7 percent of the share capital , also rejected the bid . the german group said its stake in the swedish truck maker was of " strategic character " and that it was not in its " industrial interest " to sell . man said that it had signed an agreement with french group renault to buy renault 's holding of 2.85 percent in scania .
renault owns 5.18 percent of the votes in scania . man would be n umber two with sca n ia daimlerchrysler is currently the biggest maker of trucks in europe , followed by the combined businesses of volvo and renault , according to data compiled by the acea european automobile manufacturers association . man ranks number three , but with scania it would leapfrog the other two to take the number one spot . man said it hoped to achieve cost savings of at least 500 million euros a year with the full benefits becoming effective three years after a deal .
no factory closures were planned . the headquarters of a merged group would be in munich in southern germany , but important management functions would remain in sweden . man , which makes trucks of more than six tons , employs about 80,000 people and has annual sales of 18.5 billion euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former shareholders win compensation from daimlerchrysler a stuttgart court ordered german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler to pay 232 million euros -lrb- $ 299 million -rrb- to former shareholders of daimler-benz in a legal battle over terms of its 1998 merger with us carmaker chrysler .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany supports imf reforms but harbors concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf aims to support economic growth , especially in crisis areas the imf and the world bank decided at their annual conference in singapore to give four member states more say and increase anti-corruption efforts in developing countries .
germany agrees - with some reservations . the international monetary fund and the world bank on monday raised the contribution quotas of china , south korea , mexico and turkey by a total of 1.8 percent in recognition of recent economic development there .
quotas for other countries in the 184-member organization were reduced accordingly . german finance minister peer steinbrück called the decision , approved with 90.6 percent of the vote , a " very good result . "
he also said that he considers germany underrepresented . as part of the agreement , germany 's quota was reduced by 0.1 percent , putting it at just under 6 percent .

or just a sad swan song ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black swan spends its time daydreaming about the white love bird -lrb- no , boat ! -rrb- in the back it may sound a little kinky , but even swans have their fetishes .
for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place . " she said the swan 's chances for survival are good , despite losing its " life partner , " as long as it gets enough food and water . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " get a taste of dw-world.de 's quirky stories .

or just a sad swan song ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black swan spends its time daydreaming about the white love bird -lrb- no , boat ! -rrb- in the back it may sound a little kinky , but even swans have their fetishes .
for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place . " she said the swan 's chances for survival are good , despite losing its " life partner , " as long as it gets enough food and water . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " get a taste of dw-world.de 's quirky stories .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .

" most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .

it would make my life so much easier .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

germany agrees - with some reservations . the international monetary fund and the world bank on monday raised the contribution quotas of china , south korea , mexico and turkey by a total of 1.8 percent in recognition of recent economic development there .
quotas for other countries in the 184-member organization were reduced accordingly . german finance minister peer steinbrück called the decision , approved with 90.6 percent of the vote , a " very good result . "
he also said that he considers germany underrepresented . as part of the agreement , germany 's quota was reduced by 0.1 percent , putting it at just under 6 percent .
the us , with 17 percent , remains the most strongly represented country in the group . steinbrück wants equality for eu countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück met with singapore 's pm lee hsien loong at the imf-world bank conference " the principle of equal treatment and fair burden distribution should be strictly applied to all imf members , " said steinbrück , adding that the risks associated with the imf 's planned quota reforms should be taken into account . in the most widely reaching reforms in its 60 year history , the imf is planning additional quota changes over the next two years .
india , egypt , brazil and argentina are also candidates for higher quotas due to economic progress in their countries . quotas are currently a factor of the economic strength of the member country and determine both its financial contribution to the imf and its say in decision-making processes . in a speech tuesday in singapore , steinbrück said germany would remain closely involved in the reform process .
he also reiterated germany 's position that economic openness and a country 's degree of integration into the global economy be added to the quota criteria . anti-corruption strategy passed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say world bank loans contribute to former chilean dictator pinochet 's success in addition to quota adjustments for member states , a controversial anti-corruption strategy was approved at the imf-world bank conference .
loan programs and other world bank projects in developing countries are to be scrutinized more closely . according to the new strategy , funds can be suspended or revoked if the government of the recipient country does not make adequate attempts to hinder corruption . " we have to make sure that money is spent on text books and medicine and does n't end up in the pockets of those in power , " said world bank president paul wolfowitz . some development organizations , however , are concerned that the new approach may be too stringent . " the bank 's strategy does n't work when it 's used to deny loans or demand privatization , " said representatives from the development organization oxfam . the world bank estimates that $ 1 billion -lrb- 790 million euros -rrb- are lost each year to corruption . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opposes single voice for euro countries at imf german finance minister peer steinbrück ruled out suggestions that the eurozone nations should have only one seat on the board of the international monetary fund .

it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place . " she said the swan 's chances for survival are good , despite losing its " life partner , " as long as it gets enough food and water . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " get a taste of dw-world.de 's quirky stories .

it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .

"
according to news reports , aachen player moses sichone , who comes from zambia , was also insulted with xenophobic slurs .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- is investigating the case . " racism has no place in the stadium , " volker roth , the head of the dfb 's referee comittee , told german news service dpa .
" that 's why we have told referees to not tolerate such slurs .

" the clubs are complicit , " he told der tagesspiegel newspaper .
" they can no longer excuse themselves by saying that a few trouble makers are responsible for right-wing extremist and racist incidents .
they 're responsible and have to live with the consequences - including the loss of points . " hurti n g the right people as a result of the incident in rostock , dfb officials said that they want to clamp down on " discriminating and inhuman behavior " according to the rules laid down by world soccer body fifa .
the rules call for fines for officials and players and clubs can lose points because of their fans ' behavior and be excluded from competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger does n't want to punish friendly german fans despite the problems , zwanziger said that he did not support cancelling an oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 dispute over berlin land seized by nazis heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wertheim family once owned the land on which the two buildings on the right now sit the heirs of a jewish family disowned by the nazis have vowed to continue their fight for hundreds of millions of euros in compensation .
german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .
" this is our heritage .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .

top shareholders of swedish truck maker scania have rebuffed german rival man 's 9.6 billion-euro -lrb- $ 12.2 billon -rrb- takeover offer to create a european market leader , raising pressure on germany 's man to sweeten the bid . a battle for domination of the european truck building industry began on monday with a hostile bid by german industrial group man for scania of sweden worth 9.6 billion euros . the board of scania immediately rejected the offer , which would create the biggest truck maker in europe and the third-biggest in the world . the terms , in cash and shares , represented a premium of 36 to 39 percent over the recent scania share price but were also turned down by key scania shareholders - the wallenberg family and german car maker volkswagen . man chief executive haakan samuelsson had said earlier that he was confident of winning round shareholders , which analysts said would require a higher offer price . " scania and man are two very profitable companies which complement each other ideally in industrial terms , " samuelsson said .
" the two groups have comparable structures and the same tradition as far as the work of the engineers is concerned . " he said man would operate a " dual brand " strategy after the merger , maintaining scania as a separate entity with its own research and development team .

plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place .

for a big bird in the city of münster , it is a plastic doll .
yes , folks , that 's right . it all started in the merry month of may - you know , when the flowers are blooming , the birds are chirping , the bees are a-buzzin ' and the love emotions start a-flowin ' . well , this bird - a swan - was gliding through a lake , minding its own business , when cupid shot his arrow .
plink !
it was love at first sight . the real , live swan was immediately love-struck when it beheld another of its kind gracing the middle of the lake . a match made for hollywood the only problem was that the bird 's new beloved was not only made of plastic , but also happened to be a paddle-boat styled as a swan that could pack at several passengers . but love is love , and the swan clearly demonstrated its affections for its love object in subsequent months - staring incessantly at the big , white paddle-boat , constantly swimming circles around it , and even crooning to try to capture the big bird 's attention . apparently , the live swan failed to realize that its love interest was inanimate and would not return the swooning . to top things off , the real swan has not only distinguished itself through its choice of partner , but also through its looks .
it is not white , but black , and adorned with a bright red beak .
it also happens to a native of australia rather than germany .
further , it has proven to be an exotic eye-catcher for the many joggers , bikers and boaters who spend time on or near the lake . the enchanting story of this unlikely love has even become a münster b-list trademark .
souvenir shops sell snow globes showing the odd couple as star-crossed lovers with a waterfront view . a children 's book about the swan love song is also in the making . bye , bye , my love yet like so many , this love story could also end in tragedy .
since swans are monogamous creatures , the black swan is a little " stuck " on the immense white one .
with the cold season fast approaching , the paddle-boat will likely be torn away from its lover and dry-docked . the black bird may just have one sad , sad swan song to sing come winter . " not to worry , " said biologist andrea klein .
" the australian black swan is not really wild ; otherwise , it would n't have fallen in love with the white paddle-boat swan in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 germany struggles to explain far-right election success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd can count on the help of neo-nazi comradeships politicians are scrambling to clarify why the far-right npd won seats in mecklenburg-western pomerania 's state assembly last weekend .
but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right .

but explanations should be replaced by long-term deliberation , say analysts . the debate about right-wing extremism in eastern germany has been reignited following the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in sunday 's elections in mecklenburg-western pomerania .
the npd won 7.3 percent of the vote , giving it six of the 71 seats in the eastern german state 's legislature . gideon botsch from the moses mendelssohn center for european-jewish studies at the university of potsdam said the election results were to be expected . " we had feared it would happen , so we were n't surprised , " said botsch , an expert on right-wing extremism . the " n ice nazi from n ext door " according to botsch , the results were in part due to the party 's strategy .
for one , the npd had the help of neo-nazi comradeships . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd campaigned in every corner of mecklenburg-western pomerania - with success " the npd is allied with these groups , who , for example , systematically apply intimidation tactics at events of the major democratic parties , " botsch said .
in addition , the npd took on a very civic appearance . " it 's the idea of the nice nazi from next door , " said toralf staud , author of the book " modern nazis " and a writer on right-wing extremism since 1998 .
these neo-nazis have become an integral part of civil society across wide areas in eastern germany .
in small towns and villages , right-wing extremists have for the large part taken over civic programs for children and youth , for example . " they are in parents ' associations in schools and kindergartens or in sports clubs and use their position there to relay their ideas to the people , " botsch said . there , where the state and its educational facilities are increasingly retreating , where sociopolitical groups such as religious communities are closing down their institutions , neo-nazis are investing in youth work - and infiltrating a generation with their ideology . germa n democracy n eglects society 's perimeter the election results were also the result of germany 's democratic parties ' policies , which increasingly neglect certain areas of society , botsch said . according to the latest data report by the federal statistics office , only 38 percent of eastern germans consider democracy to be the best form of government for germany .
in western germany , it was 71 percent . " there are regions in which democratic structures no longer exist , " botsch said .
there are no schools , no doctors and no churches .
" the people are frustrated and ask themselves , what alternative do we have ?
the npd then channels this frustration . " ca n vassi n g made a differe n ce according to the npd , it invested 400,000 euros -lrb- $ 508,000 -rrb- in its election campaign .
the npd in mecklenburg-western pomerania got help from saxony 's parliamentary group leader holger apfel , an experienced campaigner .
professional " comrades " helped with organization and public relations work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel from saxony 's npd helped organize the campaign " this was the most professional election campaign i have ever seen , " staud said .
the party had managed to canvas throughout the state , too . " i saw towns where only npd posters were hanging , " staud said .
" the other parties did n't even go there . "
flyers were written in a highly professional manner and in a way that was especially attractive to young people .
" the language was snappy and cheeky . "
" the major parties do n't go into small towns for the few votes there .
the npd does and it adds up , " botsch said .
" the npd was present , and not just with posters , but with concrete people . " lo n g sta n di n g discussio n s n ecessary the central council for jews in germany called the election outcome " alarming " and accused german politicians of failing to adequately combat the far-right . " the results of the election are dismaying and a sign of political bankruptcy , " the council 's president , charlotte knobloch , said in a statement . politicians faced the same situation two years ago , after the right-wing npd won seats in saxony 's legislature .
for a short period , politicians were outspoken in addressing the problem .
but the debate quickly died off . " in germany , people either talk about right-wing extremism hysterically or not at all , " author staud said .
he said the current debate would also soon wane . " this will have disastrous implications in the long-term , " staud said .
" we are lacking a calm , factual and consistent discussion on this issue . " should the npd be ba n n ed ? the election results have also reignited a discussion on whether the npd should be banned .
in march 2003 , an attempt to prohibit the party failed when the constitutional court ruled that the federal government 's use of informants within the npd was illegal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six representatives of the npd will be part of mecklenburg-western pomerania 's parliament cornelius weiss , head of the spd parliamentary group in saxony 's state legislature , said a ban was not the answer .
the best way to deal with the npd representatives was to arm oneself with knowledge in order to have the right answer for any provocation . " i fear that the party would disappear into the underground relatively quickly , " weiss told the cologne daily köl n er stadt-a n zeiger .
" it 's better to argue with these people in an open battle . " saxony 's premier , georg milbradt , said bans could not be the preferred form of societal debate . " this would not put an end to right-wing extremism , " milbradt told the newspaper berliner zeitung .
" it would just take on a different organizational form . " botsch said that the npd strategy runs under the slogan : fight on the streets , fight for minds and fight in parliament .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .
now in its 173rd year , it is the world 's biggest festival .
its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single . " not surprisingly , american accents were everywhere among the international crowd , though not enough to please the lame tourist overheard whining " why do n't they all speak english ?
it would make my life so much easier . " the real fun appears to be inside the 14 beer tents , though we had to get there early and stake out a table for several hours before the beer and band showed up . once they did , it did n't take long for me to become certain that i had perfected the drinking songs , though my german is n't great and my singing voice is even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buy one of these for your sweetie who loses at oktoberfest ? my deepest sympathies do go to the waiters , who managed to carry a precarious pyramid of steins down the aisles while shoving aside me and my camera ; the poor souls who had to clean the place ; and anyone who for whatever reason was n't drinking . oktoberfest was always something i wanted to have been to , yet was n't sure i actually wanted to go to .
but i absolutely would return .
of course , this might be because i followed the advice to leave while everyone was happy and before the beer stopped flowing . i do , however , somewhat regret that i left without a dirndl . in this new occasional series , " postcard from germany , " dw-world.de offers you snapshots of places around the country .

" merkel declined to comment on recent criticism from germany 's eastern european neighbors , where many of the german expellees lived before hitler rose to power .
she insisted , howevver , that the underlying cause of the suffering of world war ii - germany 's nazi regime - could not be forgotten . she said , however , that an appropriate place in berlin should be found for the proposed " center against expulsions . " " -lrb- the center -rrb- should send the signal that every form of expulsion and ethnic cleansing in europe and the world should be banned , " merkel said at the ceremony held by her christian democrats and their sister party , the bavaria-only christian social union in berlin . " … germa n s n ever would have bee n expelled after 1945 " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski trying to ease tensions this month " without the nazis and the immeasurable crimes , suffering and destruction that they brought about , the germans never would have been expelled after 1945 , " merkel said . plans to build the berlin-based center to commemorate an estimated 12.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled from or fled poland , then-czechoslovakia and elsewhere when the third reich collapsed have been bitterly disputed . poland 's conservative government and many poles are against the center , as they believe it aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
the polish government has claimed that germany is trying to rewrite history . tensions between neighboring germany and poland recently prompted polish prime minister jaroslaw kacynski to threaten special minority protections for ethnic germans still living in poland . despite continuing critcism from warsaw , however , german president horst köhler recently told the german association of deportees that the world must be assured that germans do not want to rewrite history . " there is no doubt that the responsibility for the expulsions lies with the criminal nazi regime and world war ii , which was started by germany , " he said . " o n goi n g phe n ome n o n " german chancellor merkel has also said that the center would not be limited to german deportees following world war ii , commenting that there would be a focus on european expellees throughout the last century . she pointed to the ethnic cleansing that occurred not long ago in the former yugoslavia and the current crisis in the darfur region of sudan , where hundreds of thousands of people have been expelled from their homeland , as evidence of the " ongoing phenomenon " of expulsion . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german , czech ministers want to extend reconciliation fund newly appointed czech foreign minister alexandr vondra visited his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier last week to discuss extending financing for reconciliation projects .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .

its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .

" most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .

in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .

principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

" merkel declined to comment on recent criticism from germany 's eastern european neighbors , where many of the german expellees lived before hitler rose to power .
she insisted , howevver , that the underlying cause of the suffering of world war ii - germany 's nazi regime - could not be forgotten . she said , however , that an appropriate place in berlin should be found for the proposed " center against expulsions . " " -lrb- the center -rrb- should send the signal that every form of expulsion and ethnic cleansing in europe and the world should be banned , " merkel said at the ceremony held by her christian democrats and their sister party , the bavaria-only christian social union in berlin . " … germa n s n ever would have bee n expelled after 1945 " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski trying to ease tensions this month " without the nazis and the immeasurable crimes , suffering and destruction that they brought about , the germans never would have been expelled after 1945 , " merkel said . plans to build the berlin-based center to commemorate an estimated 12.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled from or fled poland , then-czechoslovakia and elsewhere when the third reich collapsed have been bitterly disputed . poland 's conservative government and many poles are against the center , as they believe it aims to portray germans as victims of a war they started .
the polish government has claimed that germany is trying to rewrite history . tensions between neighboring germany and poland recently prompted polish prime minister jaroslaw kacynski to threaten special minority protections for ethnic germans still living in poland . despite continuing critcism from warsaw , however , german president horst köhler recently told the german association of deportees that the world must be assured that germans do not want to rewrite history . " there is no doubt that the responsibility for the expulsions lies with the criminal nazi regime and world war ii , which was started by germany , " he said . " o n goi n g phe n ome n o n " german chancellor merkel has also said that the center would not be limited to german deportees following world war ii , commenting that there would be a focus on european expellees throughout the last century . she pointed to the ethnic cleansing that occurred not long ago in the former yugoslavia and the current crisis in the darfur region of sudan , where hundreds of thousands of people have been expelled from their homeland , as evidence of the " ongoing phenomenon " of expulsion . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german , czech ministers want to extend reconciliation fund newly appointed czech foreign minister alexandr vondra visited his german counterpart , frank-walter steinmeier last week to discuss extending financing for reconciliation projects .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.09.2006 dispute over berlin land seized by nazis heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wertheim family once owned the land on which the two buildings on the right now sit the heirs of a jewish family disowned by the nazis have vowed to continue their fight for hundreds of millions of euros in compensation .
german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

more than 100 people were injured , most of them policemen , who were clearly outnumbered by the attackers , municipal police said . gyurcsany vowed to crack down if there were a repeat of the violence , receiving backing from the socialist coalition partner , the alliance of free democrats on tuesday . leaked tape the protests were sparked by a tape leaked to media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators included right-wing protesters the demonstrators wanted to get inside the building to read a petition after hungarian public radio broadcast a closed-door discussion between gyurcsany and his party 's deputies last may in which he said candidly the government has accomplished nothing but " rubbish " and " lied all along for the past 18 months - two years . " the 44-year-old prime minister admitted sunday that the tape-recording - from an undisclosed source - was authentic . " we did everything to keep that secret to the end of the electoral campaign , " the prime minister also said on the tape . " a vulgar speech " the socialist-liberal coalition easily won re-election last april .
but under pressure from brussels , the hungarian government this summer announced very unpopular austerity measures - including higher taxes and lower subsidies - to reduce hungary 's record public deficit in order to work toward meeting the strict criteria for adopting the euro currency . the charismatic gyurcsany , a former communist who made a fortune in business before turning to politics , said on his internet blog after his comments became known that he regretted his sometimes vulgar speech .
he wrote that he acted out of his " passion " for the country and his desire to push through the needed economic reforms . the conservative opposition fidesz party of former prime minister viktor orban said monday it would seek to force gyurcsany out of office as he has become a " persona non grata " in hungarian politics . " there is a moral crisis unfolding and ferenc gyurcsany should make it clear that his comments referred to their period in government , " tibor navracsics , fidesz faction leader told the media tuesday morning . hungarian president laszlo solyom agreed , declaring monday that the country was " in moral crisis . " electio n repercussio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is hungary in moral crisis ?
fidesz late monday expressed its complete solidarity with the demonstrators , who included militant nationalists and known football hooligans . thousands also joined demonstrations in other several towns in hungary . the hir tv commercial television channel , which is close to fidesz , broadcast the budapest demonstration live . the prime minister said the demonstrations " by radicals in the streets would not solve problems . " socialist mps meanwhile expressed unanimous backing for the prime minister and his program . with municipal elections set for oct .
1 , polls show fidesz ahead with 34 percent of voter support compared with 23 percent for the ruling coalition . but a snap poll of 500 people on monday by szonda ipsos revealed that 43 percent of people thought gyurcsany should resign immediately , while 47 percent said he should stay and 10 percent had no opinion . hungary , which joined the european union in 2004 , presented brussels earlier this month with a revised convergence plan to meet the requirements for integration into the euro zone . budapest is counting on lowering the current deficit at 10.1 percent of gross domestic product to 3.2 percent of gdp within three years . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : hungary to open spy files making an about-turn , hungary 's ruling socialist party said on wednesday that it now backed fully opening communist-era secret service files , in an attempt to confront the country 's ghosts of the past .

" despite a wave of anti-government riots , in which 150 people were hurt , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany remained defiant on tuesday , rejecting opposition calls to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany is under pressure to quit " i had spent three minutes on sunday night thinking about whether i should step down or whether i had a reason to step down , and the conclusion i came to is that absolutely not , " gyurcsany told reuters .
at the same time gyurcsany stressed that his government would " continue and accelerate " the austerity reforms launched earlier this year as part of the country 's commitments to the european union . a " moral crisis " the unrest was sparked by the leak of a tape sunday in which gyurcsany said he and his socialist party had lied for four years about hungary 's budget in order to win a general election in april . thousands of people took to the streets of budapest late on monday .
the state television building was set afire and demonstrators clashed with riot police in the first such incident of violence since the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tv car is set on fire as demonstrators stormed the headquarters of hungarian state television gyurcsany called it " the longest and darkest night of the third hungarian republic , " saying " the borderline between freedom of expression and serious disruption has been obscured .

ibolya david , leader of the smaller opposition party hungarian democratic forum told hungarian mtv television : " the prime minister should abandon public life . " " painful " times ahead hungary 's soaring budget deficit has also forced it to abandon plans to join the euro single currency in 2010 . european commission spokeswoman amelia torres told reporters in brussels that it was in the interests of the hungarian economy and its people that the economic situation was " reined in and brought to relatively sustainable levels . " " i do acknowledge the measures to achieve these results are obviously painful , " the spokeswoman for european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , will pronounce by the end of the month on a convergence plan presented by budapest in its bid to join the group of eu nations using the euro currency .
at the beginning of the month the hungarian government submitted a revised plan to prepare for adoption of the euro under which its public deficit would be slashed from 10.1 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , the highest in the eu , to 3.2 percent in 2009 . to that end , the hungarian government this summer announced a raft of unpopular austerity measures , including higher taxes and lower subsidies .

" it is very much in the interest of the hungarian people , but also very much in the interest of the european community , that the situation should be stabilized as soon as possible , " he added on the margins of customs talks with chinese officials . " there are steps that increase the revenue side and there are even more steps that decrease the expenditure side of the budget , " kovacs said .

a visiting american journalist checked it out for dw-world.de. after one , or more , of those giant 7.40 euro -lrb- $ 9.40 -rrb- beers , so much about oktoberfest starts to make perfect sense . like paying that much for beer .
or how close you suddenly become with everyone around you about 20 minutes after said beer is served . i even began envisioning how i 'd look in a long bavarian dirndl dress , with a cute apron .
and i wondered whether my husband might like some lederhosen . like that worn by the german salesman across from me , all decked out for his yearly three-day , eight-steins-daily blitz with friends . " we are absolutely normal people on the other days , " the salesman insists . universal , yet unique bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirndls are everywhere for this , we can all thank king ludwig i , who back in 1810 threw such a fabulous wedding party that it turned into a yearly affair .
now in its 173rd year , it is the world 's biggest festival .
its six million partiers supposedly drink just a liter of beer apiece , though i find that statistic kind of hard to believe . oktoberfest this year runs through oct .
3 and has the cotton candy , roller coasters and ferris wheels of festivals everywhere , but a unique energy and quirkiness .
the giant pretzels , at 3.30 euros , are not to be eaten by yourself -lrb- trust me , i tried -rrb- , those shockingly orange salmon sandwiches are quite tasty , and the ubiquitous gingerbread hearts are adorable , even the ones that have the silly line of icing reading " ich bin single . " not surprisingly , american accents were everywhere among the international crowd , though not enough to please the lame tourist overheard whining " why do n't they all speak english ?
it would make my life so much easier . " the real fun appears to be inside the 14 beer tents , though we had to get there early and stake out a table for several hours before the beer and band showed up . once they did , it did n't take long for me to become certain that i had perfected the drinking songs , though my german is n't great and my singing voice is even worse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buy one of these for your sweetie who loses at oktoberfest ? my deepest sympathies do go to the waiters , who managed to carry a precarious pyramid of steins down the aisles while shoving aside me and my camera ; the poor souls who had to clean the place ; and anyone who for whatever reason was n't drinking . oktoberfest was always something i wanted to have been to , yet was n't sure i actually wanted to go to .
but i absolutely would return .
of course , this might be because i followed the advice to leave while everyone was happy and before the beer stopped flowing . i do , however , somewhat regret that i left without a dirndl . in this new occasional series , " postcard from germany , " dw-world.de offers you snapshots of places around the country .

german retail giant karstadtquelle insists on fighting the claim in court . when germany 's highest court last year upheld her family 's claim to one of several berlin land parcels lost under the nazis , barbara principe thought her legal battle was over .
principe , a 73-year-old great-grandmother from the us state of new jersey , is the oldest living heir of the wertheim family , which ran six department stores in berlin until the 1930s . last month , a german federal agency decided that the claim also extended to prime land at potsdamer platz , the newly rebuilt center of reunified berlin . principe and the jewish claims conference , which represents the families , have expressed their interest to negotiate with german retail giant karstadtquelle , which was given the plot by berlin after reunification but sold it later to another business group .
but company officials say they will pursue every possible court appeal . karstadtquelle spokesman jörg howe said on monday that the company would face lawsuits from its stockholders if it negotiated now . " we have to resolve this matter by court … as long as there is any doubt about who is the rightful owner of this property , " howe said .
" it 's no insult to the family history it 's a very complicated matter . " most complicated case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe during a previous visit to berlin but in a press conference monday at the ritz carlton hotel , which stands on the disputed land , principe said the wertheim heirs were determined to get back what their ancestors lost .
to drive home that point , she brought along two of her grandsons , michael principe , 27 , and brad giordano , 23 . " even if i personally do not see the day , in my heart , i know my family is going to win , " principe said . the wertheim claim is among the largest and most complicated of the thousands of nazi-era reparation claims pending in germany . it involves about 25 acres of land that principe 's lawyers say could be worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 635 million -rrb- , most of it situated in an east german no-man 's land until the berlin wall fell . about half the land has been settled in the wertheim heirs ' favor . the families have so far been paid around 70 million euros , according to matthias druba , principe 's berlin attorney . but the heirs also await compensation from the sale of one of central berlin 's largest undeveloped parcels of land , on nearby leipziger platz .
the rest of the property is still tied up in court . a web of ow n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadtquelle says it has to fight the case or face lawsuits from stockholders among the most valuable is the five-acre potsdamer platz property known as the " lenne triangle , " now a tony hotel and office complex .
in august , the german federal agency that deals with property matters decided that the jewish claims conference , which represents the heirs , had a claim on the land . the lenne triangle 's ownership line is complex .
karstadtquelle bought the remnants of the wertheim company in 1994 , then sold it to developer otto beisheim for 145 million euros -lrb- $ 184 million -rrb- . druba said that the longer karstadtquelle takes to settle the matter , the more they will owe in increased property value to the wertheim heirs .
but principe said it is less about the money than about finding justice for her late father . the family fled germany in 1939 , when principe was six years old .
her father , gunther wertheim , died in 1954 as a chicken farmer who never told his daughter that the family once had jewish roots or was a department-store dynasty .
she found out years later from lawyers . " i 'm fighting , in a sense , for him , and for the family , " she said .

the ceremony in the capital , nuku 'alofa , combined christian and traditional rituals .
representatives from 30 foreign countries watched as the late king 's coffin was carried by 1,000 men to the official royal burial ground .
king tupou iv ruled the pacific nation for more than four decades , and was much loved by his people .
but his death is likely to fuel calls for greater reform .
nuku 'alofa came to a standstill as the people of tonga said goodbye to their revered leader .
buildings , roadsides and palm trees were covered in the customary black and purple mourning cloth .
for the past week , a constant stream of people has filed past the royal family 's seaside palace , leaving flowers and other gifts for the king 's widow .
thousands have also taken part in overnight prayer vigils .
long illness on tuesday morning , amid cannon fire , the coffin was carried out of the palace by an army of tongan men in traditional dress .
in pictures : royal funeral they were joined by dignitaries from dozens of countries .
among them were australian governor-general michael jeffery , japan 's crown prince naruhito and the duke and duchess of gloucester from the uk .
the prime ministers of new zealand and fiji , helen clark and laisenia qarase , also paid their respects .
king tupou iv died last week in a hospital in auckland , after a long illness .
his death is being marked by a month of official mourning , although the royal family will observe a six-month mourning period .
the late king will be succeeded by his son , tupou v , who will be officially crowned when mourning comes to an end .

its comments came after the 184 imf nations agreed a deal on monday to give some emerging economies a bigger vote .
while china , south korea , turkey and mexico all saw their voting quotas rise , india 's declined .
india said the reforms were " hopelessly flawed " .
the imf has now pledged to overhaul its voting system by 2008 .
new formula indian finance minister palaniappan chidambaram said it would " hold the imf to its promise " of a complete reform of the voting system within two years .
" we may have lost the vote but we have not lost the argument , " he said .
under the temporary reforms agreed at the imf 's annual meetings in singapore on monday , india saw its voting quota drop slightly to 1.91 % from 1.95 % .
mr chidambaram said the reform formula used to determine monday 's changes - including a country 's gdp and market openness - did not accurately reflect the economic might of emerging economies such as india .
india wants the next formula to take into account the need of large developing economies to protect their farmers and young industries from foreign competition .

the comments come a day after russia 's resources ministry cancelled its backing for the giant project in the pacific ocean .
analysts say moscow wants to pressure sakhalin 2 's western owners to open up the project to russian firms .
at present sakhalin 2 is owned by royal dutch shell , mitsui and mitsubishi .
sakhalin 2 is the only major energy project in russia currently without any russian involvement .
anglo-dutch group shell has a 55 % majority stake , while japan 's mitsui has 25 % and mitsubishi has 20 % .
however , shell has already said it would allow russia 's gas monopoly gazprom to buy a 25 % stake in the project .
' negative influence ' although sakhalin 2 is now producing a small amount of oil , the giant scheme is not due to come fully on stream until 2008 .
japanese government spokesman shinzo abe , who is favourite to become the country 's next prime minister , said japan was unhappy with the possibility of delays to the scheme .
" i am concerned that major delays might have a negative influence on overall japan-russian relations , " he said .
on monday , shell said that there were no legal grounds for russia 's resources ministry to cancel environmental approval for sakhalin 2 .
european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said he took moscow 's announcement of the cancellation of the environmental permit for sakhalin 2 " very seriously indeed " .
" in order to ensure that companies are willing to invest in multi-billion euro energy projects , a secure and predictable investment climate is necessary in russia as in the eu or indeed any country , " he said .
" without this , investment in new energy projects will be highly problematic , providing uncertainties for the world 's future energy supply . "
giant reserves sakhalin 2 is estimated to have total reserves of about one billion barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic metres of gas , making it one of the world 's largest combined oil and gas projects .

the comments come a day after russia 's resources ministry cancelled its backing for the giant project in the pacific ocean .
analysts say moscow wants to pressure sakhalin 2 's western owners to open up the project to russian firms .
at present sakhalin 2 is owned by royal dutch shell , mitsui and mitsubishi .
sakhalin 2 is the only major energy project in russia currently without any russian involvement .
anglo-dutch group shell has a 55 % majority stake , while japan 's mitsui has 25 % and mitsubishi has 20 % .
however , shell has already said it would allow russia 's gas monopoly gazprom to buy a 25 % stake in the project .
' negative influence ' although sakhalin 2 is now producing a small amount of oil , the giant scheme is not due to come fully on stream until 2008 .
japanese government spokesman shinzo abe , who is favourite to become the country 's next prime minister , said japan was unhappy with the possibility of delays to the scheme .
" i am concerned that major delays might have a negative influence on overall japan-russian relations , " he said .
on monday , shell said that there were no legal grounds for russia 's resources ministry to cancel environmental approval for sakhalin 2 .
european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said he took moscow 's announcement of the cancellation of the environmental permit for sakhalin 2 " very seriously indeed " .
" in order to ensure that companies are willing to invest in multi-billion euro energy projects , a secure and predictable investment climate is necessary in russia as in the eu or indeed any country , " he said .
" without this , investment in new energy projects will be highly problematic , providing uncertainties for the world 's future energy supply . "
giant reserves sakhalin 2 is estimated to have total reserves of about one billion barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic metres of gas , making it one of the world 's largest combined oil and gas projects .

the clashes happened following a rally demanding the resignation of pm ferenc gyurcsany , after it was revealed his government had lied during an election .
the worst fighting came when protesters stormed the state television building .
dozens of people were hurt , including many police officers .
the city is now said to be calm .
it was the first such unrest to take place in hungary since the fall of communism and the establishment of democracy in the late 1980s .
an emergency meeting of the national security cabinet was called for tuesday morning .
the main opposition party , the centre-right fidesz , says it will boycott parliament .
petition the bbc 's nick thorpe , in central budapest , says the trouble at the state television station began when a small group of protesters who had spent the day outside parliament tried to hand in a petition .
the police used tear gas and water cannon on a group of protesters who broke into the building .
for a brief period the station went off the air . "
we screwed up .
not a little , a lot .
no european country has done something as boneheaded as we have " ferenc gyurcsany excerpt from leaked tape recorded in april " nothing like this has happened since 1956 , " one young protester told reuters news agency , referring to hungary 's failed uprising against soviet rule in october 1956 .
officials told state news 150 people were injured in the violence , including 102 police officers .
our correspondent says the city is now mostly quiet , with only a handful of protesters left in the area .
earlier mr gyurcsany told the state news service he had no plans to resign .
" the street is not a solution , but instead causes conflict and crisis , " he said .
" our job is to resolve the conflict and prevent a crisis . "
he said those who had called for a " radical solution " to hungary 's problems were also partly to blame .
smaller protests were also held in other cities around hungary .
leaked tape mr gyurcsany 's comments , which sparked the violence , were heard in a tape of a meeting he had with his mps a few weeks after april 's election , and leaked to local media on sunday .
in excerpts broadcast on state radio , mr gyurcsany says harsh economic reforms are needed .
" there is not much choice .
there is not , because we screwed up .
not a little , a lot .
no european country has done something as boneheaded as we have .
" evidently , we lied throughout the last year-and-a-half , two years ...
you can not quote any significant government measure we can be proud of , other than at the end we managed to bring the government back from the brink .
nothing . "
in a speech sprinkled with obscenities , mr gyurcsany says : " we lied in the morning , we lied in the evening . "
' telling the truth ' the prime minister has received the backing of socialist mps who on monday voted unanimously to support him .
however , hungary 's president , laszlo solyom , said mr gyurcsany had created a " moral crisis " , and opposition parties have called for his resignation .
matyas oersi , an mp with the free democrat party - the junior coalition partner in the government - told the bbc : " it 's a surprise - though understandable - that the people are angry at a political leader who , for the first time , is telling the truth : that the whole political class was lying . "
protests had already been planned this week over tough austerity measures imposed following the socialists ' victory in last april 's election , which have seen the government 's popularity plummet .
the measures , imposed under pressure from brussels , include higher taxes and benefit cuts , are aimed at reducing hungary 's large public deficit .
but our correspondent says the leaked revelations were , for some of the protesters , the straw that broke the camel 's back .
local elections are scheduled in two weeks ' time .
the socialists and their liberal coalition allies are trailing fidesz in the polls .

christopher tolkien has spent 30 years working on the children of hurin , which the lord of the rings author started in 1918 and later abandoned .
extracts from the children of hurin have been published before .
jrr tolkien 's the lord of the rings trilogy has sold more than 50 million copies and was adapted into three hugely successful films .
" it has seemed to me for a long time that there was a good case for presenting my father 's long version of the legend of the children of hurin as an independent work , between its own covers , " christopher tolkien said in a statement .

a camouflaged pick-up truck with a mounted anti-tank gun is parked nearby .
the windscreen displays several images of yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh , and the uniformed driver is playing pro-government music on the sound system .
inside the building , claudia aranda and carlos albisu , members of the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- election observation mission , are ensconced in talks with local election candidates and officials .
this is bilad al-rous district , less than 30 miles -lrb- 50km -rrb- south of yemen 's capital , sanaa .
the 16,000-strong population , spread out among 50 villages , forms a stronghold of mr saleh 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- , and constitutes his tribal base .
the president 's home turf - the village of beit al-ahmar - is only 10 miles away .
the gpc 's support here is so strong that there is no visible sign of support for any of mr saleh 's presidential rivals and there is no opposition candidate standing in the local elections , only the incumbent councillor and two independents .
cultural barriers carlos and claudia are both long-term observers , spending a month in yemen ahead of the joint presidential and local elections , and one of 20 teams operating in each of yemen 's governorates . "
we want the international media to see that we have fair , just and democratic elections in yemen " hafdullah al-reisani it is their job to talk to the voters , get to grips with the local issues and establish the procedures that will be in place on election day .
" we spend every day in the field .
it can take time to get a satisfactory answer to our questions , even with a good interpreter , but we 'll stay until we 've clarified our points , " says claudia .
the election observers are n't just facing a language barrier .
throughout yemen , the eu 's culture of transparency is coming face to face with close networks of traditional tribal and family loyalties .
" people can be a little cautious and reluctant to open up at first but we remind them that the yemenis themselves invited us to come here , " says carlos .
raising standards during lunch at a road-side restaurant , the eu team cuts a very different profile from their hosts .
the election committee , sporting full-length robes , woollen shawls and curved ceremonial daggers , sit alongside claudia in her puma trainers and cropped hair , and carlos in his short-sleeved shirt .
but there is certainly a spirit of co-operation .
" we welcome claudia and carlos .
we want the international media to see that we have fair , just and democratic elections in yemen , " says hafdullah al-reisani , the gpc councillor who is standing for re-election after six years in office .
his sentiment is supported by the chair of the district electoral committee , ahmed saleh al-naheem .
" we 're glad that claudio and carlos will be present on election day , " he says .
but ahmed , who represents the opposition people 's union of popular forces , adds : " we also want the eu monitors to raise our electoral standards . "
democratic principles on 20 september , the 100-strong eu team will be supported by parallel but separate domestic and international monitoring operations .
it 's the first time that yemen 's elections will be monitored on this scale .
yemen 's four million women voters will be asked to remove the veil so the photos on their identity cards can be checked by female election officials .
and the supreme commission for elections and referendum is hoping that yemen 's men will heed the ban on guns in polling stations and prevent the violence and bloodshed that has blighted yemen 's previous elections and already claimed at least seven lives in this campaign .
" during yemen 's parliamentary elections in 2003 , we documented credible reports of political intimidation , underage voting , vote buying and improper behaviour by security forces , " says robin madrid , director of the us-funded national institute for democracy .
" this election is an important opportunity for yemen to demonstrate that it respects democratic principles and the monitors have a crucial role to play . "

paul brown , who is based in the kent town , has already set up another branch in south london to cope with demand .
but he said more quality housing was needed to prevent investors and commuters from looking elsewhere .
council leader paul watkins said a variety of housing would be offered in order to benefit local people as well .
it was announced in july that dover priory station would be included in the ctrl route running into london .
' need for growth ' hourly high-speed services are due to begin between dover and st pancras in december 2009 , with journeys taking just over an hour .
mr brown said it was imperative the town had the right kind of accommodation to offer potential commuters .
people earning in excess of £ 30,000 a year expected " a high standard of living " , he said .
" i think we 've got to look at maybe relaxing certain restrictions that local councillors put on developers , certain sites that go above a number of units - developers are then requested to put affordable housing mixed in with those sites , " he explained .
mr watkins , leader of dover district council , agreed there was " definitely a need for growth " in the town .

commonly known as the " issaka boys " , the gangs have a reputation for hacking their victims to death .
in response to the public outcry , the liberian justice ministry has called on residents to protect themselves .
citing a " police inability to decisively deal with this upsurge in criminal activities " , the statement asks " community dwellers to organize themselves into vigilante groups " .
most communities have now moved to set up vigilante groups to protect themselves from the menace .
" we are prepared to defend our neighbourhoods from being attacked by the issaka boys , " moses tom-kollie , a vigilante leader in the north-eastern suburb of paynesville , says .
" we will face them , subdue them and turn them over to the police . "
' slow process ' the un 's military and civilian police units , as well as the liberian police , have stepped up patrols in and around monrovia . "
it takes time for communities that have seen violence over the years to begin to start feeling safe amongst themselves " anders johansson un mission , liberia tanzania 's ' gang ' vigilantes armed un soldiers , accompanied by unarmed liberian police officers , are out in force around monrovia , riding about in neighbourhoods at night and conducting random vehicle searches .
commander anders johansson , a spokesman at the un mission , admits that a lot must be done to boost liberians ' confidence in their security .
" it takes time for communities that have seen violence over the years to begin to start feeling safe amongst themselves , " he said .
he plays down monrovians ' criticism that the 15,000 un troops keeping the peace in the country have not done much to stop armed banditry since the end of the 14-year civil war .
" we have been and always will be on top of the security situation , " he says .
but for victims of the issaka boys more needs to be done .
one man was returning to monrovia from rural liberia when they surrounded him and demanded his money and belongings .
" when i refused they started gashing me with their long and fearful cutlasses leaving me to bleed profusely from all parts of my body , " james karmon told a local newspaper .
" when i regained consciousness , i found myself lying in the hospital .
thank god they did n't kill me as they usually do , " he said .
big challenges now that a un arms embargo on liberia has been partially lifted , the residents want a robust liberian police force , armed to combat the criminals .
liberian police chief munah beatrice sieh alluded to that when she briefed a squadron preparing for night patrols .
" you have been doing your best under the circumstances , " she said , characterising the security forces as a biblical david taking on the goliath-like criminal gangs , comprised of ex-fighters .
cdr johansson of the un says the liberian police must be armed gradually .
" we are n't going to rush into things .
we must make sure that everybody is ready before we take that next step , " he said .
monrovia 's deplorable roads and its lack of public electricity are among the challenges the un mission faces as it tries to combat crime in the liberian capital .
