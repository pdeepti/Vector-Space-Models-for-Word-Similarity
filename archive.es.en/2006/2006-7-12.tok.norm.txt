now they 're going to catch up in germany us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders . merkel invited bush to visit her electoral ward in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania during a trip to washington earlier this year .
bush , accompanied by his wife laura , will arrive late on wednesday before meeting with merkel in the historical baltic port town of stralsund on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush visits to stralsund to see former eastern germany merkel said in an interview on rtl television on monday that it was important for bush to see for himself the " changes and problems " caused by the reunification of germany in 1990 . as well as stralsund , bush will also visit the neighboring towns of heiligendamm and trinwillershagen during his two-day stop-over before heading to the g8 summit in russia . merkel , who grew up in eastern germany , said bush 's trip would help " complete the picture " of the country . better personal relations dr. andreas etges from the berlin-based john f. kennedy institute for north america studies thinks bush 's visit to stralsund is a " definite sign of the improving personal relations between the two leaders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder criticized the us-led war in iraq causing a cool relationship with bush " bush 's relationship with -lrb- former chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder was beyond redemption , " said etges , " and this visit is a symbol that he is interested in merkel 's personal biography .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .

now they 're going to catch up in germany us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders . merkel invited bush to visit her electoral ward in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania during a trip to washington earlier this year .
bush , accompanied by his wife laura , will arrive late on wednesday before meeting with merkel in the historical baltic port town of stralsund on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush visits to stralsund to see former eastern germany merkel said in an interview on rtl television on monday that it was important for bush to see for himself the " changes and problems " caused by the reunification of germany in 1990 . as well as stralsund , bush will also visit the neighboring towns of heiligendamm and trinwillershagen during his two-day stop-over before heading to the g8 summit in russia . merkel , who grew up in eastern germany , said bush 's trip would help " complete the picture " of the country . better personal relations dr. andreas etges from the berlin-based john f. kennedy institute for north america studies thinks bush 's visit to stralsund is a " definite sign of the improving personal relations between the two leaders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder criticized the us-led war in iraq causing a cool relationship with bush " bush 's relationship with -lrb- former chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder was beyond redemption , " said etges , " and this visit is a symbol that he is interested in merkel 's personal biography . " although the two disagree on issues such as the guantanamo bay prison , they have cooperated closely on trying to get iran to end its nuclear program . according to etges , bush 's visit also shows that us needs germany as a diplomatic partner . relations between the us and italy have cooled since former prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close bush ally , was defeated in april elections .
in addition , british prime tony blair 's attention is increasingly caught up with shoring up his failing popularity at home .
this leaves merkel as one of the dominant players on the us-europe stage , etges said . not everybody is thrilled by visit officials in mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is governed by a coalition of the center-left social democratic party and the far-left left party , are miffed that they might have to foot the bill for ballooning security costs and the deployment of some 12,500 police to the region . the feeling is that because merkel , a christian democrat , invited bush , the federal government should shoulder the majority of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald ringstorff thinks berlin should foot the bill for bush 's visit or as harald ringstorff , the state premier put it , " the one who orders the music should pay for it .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .

" no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .
new germany as foundation for un agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche post , here the headquarters , helps upkeep bonn 's status while bonn and the german government preserved as much of the federal structure in the former capital as was possible , they also wanted to make it the fourth european home of the un after geneva , vienna and paris .
germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .
over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for annan and the un in bonn but bonn and germany are not stopping there .
angela merkel ’ s administration has committed germany to attracting other un institutions , a desire she repeated to kofi annan on tuesday in bonn .
across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .
currently it is unclear what it will be called but the city hopes the un will allow the name " united nations congress center . "
another 2,000 jobs are expected to be created through the center .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .

next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .

the meeting , which opened tuesday , was attended by anthony brenton , the british ambassador to moscow , as well as two senior state department officials from washington .
the diplomats emphasized that their intention was not to meddle in russian domestic politics , but simply to gain another perspective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world chess champion garry kasparov has led an opposition g8 conference criticism of putin 's russia as the g8 summit looms , even the western media is stepping up its criticism of democracy and human rights in putin 's russia .
the bush administration , particularly vice-president dick cheney , have been openly critical of moscow 's brutal suppression of the chechnya conflict , in which separatists have been battling russian forces for more than a decade now . the west has also criticized putin 's autocratic tendencies .
besides attacks on press freedoms , europeans and americans have expressed concerns about the virtual nationalization of key enterprises , such as the yukos oil giant , and russia 's lax business practices , such as lack of respect for intellectual property rights .
the europeans , who experienced a gas shortfall this past winter due to price disputes russia had with the ukraine , are also anxious about relying too heavily on moscow for their energy needs . exposing abuses of power the other russia opposition group , which also includes former prime minister mikhail kasyanov and two former kremlin advisers , says it wants to expose abuses of power in putin 's russia . " the official model imposed by the authorities is a monopoly over the economy , business , politics , ideology and civil society .
we stand for alternatives , the right of people to openly debate these alternatives , and freely choose for themselves " , said the kremlin 's former chief economic advisor , andrei illaryonov in an interview with the christian science monitor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister sergei lavrov -lrb- with german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- dismissed concerns of dissidents russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , dismissed the criticisms and said " certain people clearly find it hard to get used to the idea that russian has regained its strength and is once more to be reckoned with in world politics . " putin 's supporters have argued that issues such as human rights and press freedom need to be seen in perspective , considering that russia only emerged from soviet-style repression less than two decades ago .
the state no longer exercises control over the private lives if its citizens as it did in the former communist era .
today millions of russians have been able to travel abroad , operate their own businesses and own their own homes . common global issues they say that the g8 conference needs to be a forum to discuss issues of common interest , and should not be sidelined by internal dissidents . for russia , one of the key items on the summit agenda is its energy exports .
moscow wants guarantees from europe for its gas supplies , so that it can make long term investments .
europe and the us also view the opening of russian 's oil and gas supplies to foreign investment as essential to long-term stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting of g8 foreign ministers in moscow last month nuclear non-proliferation and strategies for dealing with north korea and iran are expected to dominate summit discussions , with the west favouring a tougher stance towards the rogue states than moscow . that does n't mean that criticism of what russia views as an internal matter will be off the agenda .
as secretary of state condoleezza rice told reporters at a news conference at a meeting of foreign ministers in moscow last month : " we believe we can raise anything among our g8 colleagues .

so now , it is time to move on . a nation feels abandoned .
german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .
is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .
he bore the brunt of the media pressure before matches .
klinsmann enjoyed the laurels , or suffered the indignity of difficult questions afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new coach , same goals - top titles and just like klinsmann did at his first press conference as national coach in august 2004 , when he said germany would win the world cup , löw had similar words : " we want to become european champions -lrb- in 2008 -rrb- . " after the third-place finish in germany , the bravado in such a statement is naturally missing .
klinsmann has " cleared the path " that the team has to continue following , löw said during a news conference in frankfurt on wednesday . " only by doing this can we establish ourselves amongst the best teams in the world , " löw said . feels exhausted like klinsmann one of löw 's first tasks is to find an assistant .
the coaching and management staff is , for the most part , already there .
oliver bierhoff will be the manager .
andreas köpke will be the goalkeeper coach .
but the question as to who will be second-in-command remains open . " i will take a few days in peace to think about -lrb- who i will hire -rrb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw will now move to the center of cameramen 's attention löw has coached stuttgart and karlsruhe in germany , as well as fenerbahce istanbul and adanaspor in turkey , and fc tirol innsbruck and austria vienna in austria . during those assignments he won the title in austria and a german cup with stuttgart .
yet those honors probably do n't compare much with the experience of the past month .
they were not nearly as mentally and physically exhausting as this world cup .
he plans to first go on vacation to regain some strength - just like klinsmann .
but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .
it will be against a familiar opponent , sweden , whom germany knocked out of the world cup in the round of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newcomer podolski -lrb- l -rrb- provided offensive power that victory was symbolic of the new style of soccer that klinsmann had injected into the team .
within 12 minutes , newcomer of the tournament , lukas podolski , had put germany up 2-0 in a frenetic start , sending the crowd in munich into pandemonium .
german soccer fans had a team to be proud of .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .

so now , it is time to move on . a nation feels abandoned .
german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .
is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .

is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .
after all , löw inherits a fine team and a nation , which believes in itself and its soccer players , right ? uta thofern -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .
but woe to him if the team fails to qualify for that tournament , and dashes the hopes of millions of germans eager to renew 2006 's summer soccer love-fest . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?

a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .
he bore the brunt of the media pressure before matches .
klinsmann enjoyed the laurels , or suffered the indignity of difficult questions afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new coach , same goals - top titles and just like klinsmann did at his first press conference as national coach in august 2004 , when he said germany would win the world cup , löw had similar words : " we want to become european champions -lrb- in 2008 -rrb- . " after the third-place finish in germany , the bravado in such a statement is naturally missing .
klinsmann has " cleared the path " that the team has to continue following , löw said during a news conference in frankfurt on wednesday . " only by doing this can we establish ourselves amongst the best teams in the world , " löw said . feels exhausted like klinsmann one of löw 's first tasks is to find an assistant .
the coaching and management staff is , for the most part , already there .
oliver bierhoff will be the manager .
andreas köpke will be the goalkeeper coach .
but the question as to who will be second-in-command remains open .

yet those honors probably do n't compare much with the experience of the past month .
they were not nearly as mentally and physically exhausting as this world cup .
he plans to first go on vacation to regain some strength - just like klinsmann .
but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .
it will be against a familiar opponent , sweden , whom germany knocked out of the world cup in the round of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newcomer podolski -lrb- l -rrb- provided offensive power that victory was symbolic of the new style of soccer that klinsmann had injected into the team .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .
but woe to him if the team fails to qualify for that tournament , and dashes the hopes of millions of germans eager to renew 2006 's summer soccer love-fest . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- oktoberfest less boozy this year while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .
already , 10 to 15 percent of the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- project has been spent in planning and preparation , vogel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco removes cologne cathedral from endangered list unesco has removed sites in europe , africa and asia from its list of world heritage sites that face man-made or natural threats , the united nations cultural body said monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit " we can not solve problems without russia " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " europe -pipe- 12.07.2006 russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin will be hosting the g8 summit this weekend the g8 summit , which will be dominated by issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and energy co-operation between russia and the west , has also become a forum for russian opposition groups . as preparations for this weekend 's g8 summit get underway in st. petersburg , an opposition group led by former world chess champion garry kasparov has become a thorn on the side of russian president vladimir putin . kasparov 's opposition group , called drugaya rossiya or the other russia , is staging an " alternative " g8 conference , condemning the kremlin 's suppression of press and judicial freedoms .
the meeting , which opened tuesday , was attended by anthony brenton , the british ambassador to moscow , as well as two senior state department officials from washington .
the diplomats emphasized that their intention was not to meddle in russian domestic politics , but simply to gain another perspective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world chess champion garry kasparov has led an opposition g8 conference criticism of putin 's russia as the g8 summit looms , even the western media is stepping up its criticism of democracy and human rights in putin 's russia .
the bush administration , particularly vice-president dick cheney , have been openly critical of moscow 's brutal suppression of the chechnya conflict , in which separatists have been battling russian forces for more than a decade now . the west has also criticized putin 's autocratic tendencies .
besides attacks on press freedoms , europeans and americans have expressed concerns about the virtual nationalization of key enterprises , such as the yukos oil giant , and russia 's lax business practices , such as lack of respect for intellectual property rights .
the europeans , who experienced a gas shortfall this past winter due to price disputes russia had with the ukraine , are also anxious about relying too heavily on moscow for their energy needs . exposing abuses of power the other russia opposition group , which also includes former prime minister mikhail kasyanov and two former kremlin advisers , says it wants to expose abuses of power in putin 's russia . " the official model imposed by the authorities is a monopoly over the economy , business , politics , ideology and civil society .
we stand for alternatives , the right of people to openly debate these alternatives , and freely choose for themselves " , said the kremlin 's former chief economic advisor , andrei illaryonov in an interview with the christian science monitor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister sergei lavrov -lrb- with german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- dismissed concerns of dissidents russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , dismissed the criticisms and said " certain people clearly find it hard to get used to the idea that russian has regained its strength and is once more to be reckoned with in world politics . " putin 's supporters have argued that issues such as human rights and press freedom need to be seen in perspective , considering that russia only emerged from soviet-style repression less than two decades ago .
the state no longer exercises control over the private lives if its citizens as it did in the former communist era .
today millions of russians have been able to travel abroad , operate their own businesses and own their own homes . common global issues they say that the g8 conference needs to be a forum to discuss issues of common interest , and should not be sidelined by internal dissidents . for russia , one of the key items on the summit agenda is its energy exports .
moscow wants guarantees from europe for its gas supplies , so that it can make long term investments .
europe and the us also view the opening of russian 's oil and gas supplies to foreign investment as essential to long-term stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting of g8 foreign ministers in moscow last month nuclear non-proliferation and strategies for dealing with north korea and iran are expected to dominate summit discussions , with the west favouring a tougher stance towards the rogue states than moscow . that does n't mean that criticism of what russia views as an internal matter will be off the agenda .
as secretary of state condoleezza rice told reporters at a news conference at a meeting of foreign ministers in moscow last month : " we believe we can raise anything among our g8 colleagues .
we wo n't hesitate to talk about our concerns about the freedom of the press , and we do so in a spirit of candor and cooperation .

" it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley .

the meeting , which opened tuesday , was attended by anthony brenton , the british ambassador to moscow , as well as two senior state department officials from washington .
the diplomats emphasized that their intention was not to meddle in russian domestic politics , but simply to gain another perspective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world chess champion garry kasparov has led an opposition g8 conference criticism of putin 's russia as the g8 summit looms , even the western media is stepping up its criticism of democracy and human rights in putin 's russia .

besides attacks on press freedoms , europeans and americans have expressed concerns about the virtual nationalization of key enterprises , such as the yukos oil giant , and russia 's lax business practices , such as lack of respect for intellectual property rights .
the europeans , who experienced a gas shortfall this past winter due to price disputes russia had with the ukraine , are also anxious about relying too heavily on moscow for their energy needs . exposing abuses of power the other russia opposition group , which also includes former prime minister mikhail kasyanov and two former kremlin advisers , says it wants to expose abuses of power in putin 's russia .

in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .

german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .

a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .

has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .
already , 10 to 15 percent of the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- project has been spent in planning and preparation , vogel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco removes cologne cathedral from endangered list unesco has removed sites in europe , africa and asia from its list of world heritage sites that face man-made or natural threats , the united nations cultural body said monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .

bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .
new germany as foundation for un agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche post , here the headquarters , helps upkeep bonn 's status while bonn and the german government preserved as much of the federal structure in the former capital as was possible , they also wanted to make it the fourth european home of the un after geneva , vienna and paris .
germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .
over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for annan and the un in bonn but bonn and germany are not stopping there .
angela merkel ’ s administration has committed germany to attracting other un institutions , a desire she repeated to kofi annan on tuesday in bonn .
across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .
currently it is unclear what it will be called but the city hopes the un will allow the name " united nations congress center . "
another 2,000 jobs are expected to be created through the center .

the meeting , which opened tuesday , was attended by anthony brenton , the british ambassador to moscow , as well as two senior state department officials from washington .
the diplomats emphasized that their intention was not to meddle in russian domestic politics , but simply to gain another perspective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world chess champion garry kasparov has led an opposition g8 conference criticism of putin 's russia as the g8 summit looms , even the western media is stepping up its criticism of democracy and human rights in putin 's russia .
the bush administration , particularly vice-president dick cheney , have been openly critical of moscow 's brutal suppression of the chechnya conflict , in which separatists have been battling russian forces for more than a decade now . the west has also criticized putin 's autocratic tendencies .
besides attacks on press freedoms , europeans and americans have expressed concerns about the virtual nationalization of key enterprises , such as the yukos oil giant , and russia 's lax business practices , such as lack of respect for intellectual property rights .
the europeans , who experienced a gas shortfall this past winter due to price disputes russia had with the ukraine , are also anxious about relying too heavily on moscow for their energy needs . exposing abuses of power the other russia opposition group , which also includes former prime minister mikhail kasyanov and two former kremlin advisers , says it wants to expose abuses of power in putin 's russia . " the official model imposed by the authorities is a monopoly over the economy , business , politics , ideology and civil society .
we stand for alternatives , the right of people to openly debate these alternatives , and freely choose for themselves " , said the kremlin 's former chief economic advisor , andrei illaryonov in an interview with the christian science monitor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister sergei lavrov -lrb- with german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- dismissed concerns of dissidents russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , dismissed the criticisms and said " certain people clearly find it hard to get used to the idea that russian has regained its strength and is once more to be reckoned with in world politics . " putin 's supporters have argued that issues such as human rights and press freedom need to be seen in perspective , considering that russia only emerged from soviet-style repression less than two decades ago .
the state no longer exercises control over the private lives if its citizens as it did in the former communist era .
today millions of russians have been able to travel abroad , operate their own businesses and own their own homes . common global issues they say that the g8 conference needs to be a forum to discuss issues of common interest , and should not be sidelined by internal dissidents . for russia , one of the key items on the summit agenda is its energy exports .
moscow wants guarantees from europe for its gas supplies , so that it can make long term investments .
europe and the us also view the opening of russian 's oil and gas supplies to foreign investment as essential to long-term stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting of g8 foreign ministers in moscow last month nuclear non-proliferation and strategies for dealing with north korea and iran are expected to dominate summit discussions , with the west favouring a tougher stance towards the rogue states than moscow . that does n't mean that criticism of what russia views as an internal matter will be off the agenda .
as secretary of state condoleezza rice told reporters at a news conference at a meeting of foreign ministers in moscow last month : " we believe we can raise anything among our g8 colleagues .
we wo n't hesitate to talk about our concerns about the freedom of the press , and we do so in a spirit of candor and cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . " klinsmann had left his future with the team open immediately following the tournament , saying he needed a few days to digest the emotional experience , consider his professional options and talk with his family before making a decision that would , he said , be between his " heart and mind . " " my big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them , " the california-based klinsmann said .

" the only sensible option has been to ask joachim to lead them further , " he said .
" i am very glad that he has taken up this challenge . " löw , a former midfielder and bundesliga coach who worked closely with klinsmann over the past two years and comes from the same region in southwest germany , has agreed on a two-year contract to coach the team . the 46-year-old said he would continue with klinsmann 's approach .

this leaves merkel as one of the dominant players on the us-europe stage , etges said . not everybody is thrilled by visit officials in mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is governed by a coalition of the center-left social democratic party and the far-left left party , are miffed that they might have to foot the bill for ballooning security costs and the deployment of some 12,500 police to the region . the feeling is that because merkel , a christian democrat , invited bush , the federal government should shoulder the majority of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald ringstorff thinks berlin should foot the bill for bush 's visit or as harald ringstorff , the state premier put it , " the one who orders the music should pay for it .

" " you could build a whole new children 's home with all that money , " he said . other residents are annoyed by the extensive security measures during the visit .
no cars are allowed to be parked in the historical city center ; bicycles have to be stored inside ; mail boxes will be sealed for the day ; and all outdoor flowerpots have to be dismantled . streets cleared for president 's visit despite their efforts , the majority of stralsund 's 58,000 residents wo n't get to see the president .
only 1,200 specially invited guests will be allowed to gather in the center . engineer heiko lawrenz from stralsund plans to escape to a building site for the day .
" you have to be inside from eight in the morning , and ca n't open a window or come out until the president leaves , " he fumed .
" i ca n't make any appointments , and it will impossible to work . " then of course , there is the thorny issue of bush 's politics .
" not much " was lawrenz 's response when asked what he thought of the us president . members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " are expecting thousands of anti-war campaigners to turn up on thursday .
however , monty schädel , one of the organizers , said that because stralsund is so out of the way , she expects the protest to be much smaller than the rallies held during bush 's visit to the central german town of mainz in february , 2005 .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . " klinsmann had left his future with the team open immediately following the tournament , saying he needed a few days to digest the emotional experience , consider his professional options and talk with his family before making a decision that would , he said , be between his " heart and mind . " " my big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them , " the california-based klinsmann said .
" but another important reason is that after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands gathered in berlin to thank klinsmann and the german team though he may be a national hero now , klinsmann had a rough ride in germany in the run up to the world cup . two years ago , he was the third choice to take over the coaching job from rudi völler and regularly clashed with german soccer officials due to his decision to commute from his adopted home in california .
he also endured fierce criticism for his coaching methods , player selection and staff requests . the 41-year-old , who is married to an american and has two children , is also known to cherish the anonymity he has in the united states . " he is famous all over europe , " said bruce arena , the us coach and a friend of klinsmann 's .
" in california , he 's just another good-looking blond guy on the beach . " klinsmann has denied numerous rumors that he could take over the american team for arena , who has been on the us bench for the last eight years , but has not made any statements regarding his future plans .

" the only sensible option has been to ask joachim to lead them further , " he said .
" i am very glad that he has taken up this challenge . " löw , a former midfielder and bundesliga coach who worked closely with klinsmann over the past two years and comes from the same region in southwest germany , has agreed on a two-year contract to coach the team . the 46-year-old said he would continue with klinsmann 's approach .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .

fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .

no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- oktoberfest less boozy this year while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink .
-lrb- oct .

aside from watching games , some visitors are spending a fortune .

" the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley .

" vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .

" it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley .

the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2006 un campus ceremony proves that bonn lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and un chief annan cut the tape to bonn 's future when the german parliament decided to return to the country ’ s traditional seat of power , berlin , many thought then capital bonn would fade into insignificance .
the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .
new germany as foundation for un agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche post , here the headquarters , helps upkeep bonn 's status while bonn and the german government preserved as much of the federal structure in the former capital as was possible , they also wanted to make it the fourth european home of the un after geneva , vienna and paris .
germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .

the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .

the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . " klinsmann had left his future with the team open immediately following the tournament , saying he needed a few days to digest the emotional experience , consider his professional options and talk with his family before making a decision that would , he said , be between his " heart and mind . " " my big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them , " the california-based klinsmann said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands gathered in berlin to thank klinsmann and the german team though he may be a national hero now , klinsmann had a rough ride in germany in the run up to the world cup . two years ago , he was the third choice to take over the coaching job from rudi völler and regularly clashed with german soccer officials due to his decision to commute from his adopted home in california .
he also endured fierce criticism for his coaching methods , player selection and staff requests . the 41-year-old , who is married to an american and has two children , is also known to cherish the anonymity he has in the united states . " he is famous all over europe , " said bruce arena , the us coach and a friend of klinsmann 's .
" in california , he 's just another good-looking blond guy on the beach . " klinsmann has denied numerous rumors that he could take over the american team for arena , who has been on the us bench for the last eight years , but has not made any statements regarding his future plans .
before coaching germany he ran a soccer consulting firm . löw to replace klinsmann bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann and löw announced their decisions at a press conference in frankfurt on wednesday after short-lived speculation about who would replace klinsmann as german national coach , on wednesday it was announced that his assistant , joachim löw , would take over . klinsmann said he felt he had left a legacy that could be built upon and that löw was the best man to succeed him . " the only sensible option has been to ask joachim to lead them further , " he said .
" i am very glad that he has taken up this challenge . " löw , a former midfielder and bundesliga coach who worked closely with klinsmann over the past two years and comes from the same region in southwest germany , has agreed on a two-year contract to coach the team . the 46-year-old said he would continue with klinsmann 's approach .

the talks extinguished recent eu hopes of gaining ground in the standoff . talks between european union foreign policy chief javier solana and iran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani tuesday were " disappointing " , solana 's spokeswoman said . the comment was in stark contrast to repeated eu expressions of hope in recent weeks regarding negotiations with tehran , aimed at avoiding an escalation of the standoff between the islamic republic and the west .

" they said that the offer was positive , but we did n't manage to find out what ambiguities they found , " said the official , requesting anonymity .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday .

now they 're going to catch up in germany us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders . merkel invited bush to visit her electoral ward in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania during a trip to washington earlier this year .
bush , accompanied by his wife laura , will arrive late on wednesday before meeting with merkel in the historical baltic port town of stralsund on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush visits to stralsund to see former eastern germany merkel said in an interview on rtl television on monday that it was important for bush to see for himself the " changes and problems " caused by the reunification of germany in 1990 . as well as stralsund , bush will also visit the neighboring towns of heiligendamm and trinwillershagen during his two-day stop-over before heading to the g8 summit in russia . merkel , who grew up in eastern germany , said bush 's trip would help " complete the picture " of the country . better personal relations dr. andreas etges from the berlin-based john f. kennedy institute for north america studies thinks bush 's visit to stralsund is a " definite sign of the improving personal relations between the two leaders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder criticized the us-led war in iraq causing a cool relationship with bush " bush 's relationship with -lrb- former chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder was beyond redemption , " said etges , " and this visit is a symbol that he is interested in merkel 's personal biography . " although the two disagree on issues such as the guantanamo bay prison , they have cooperated closely on trying to get iran to end its nuclear program . according to etges , bush 's visit also shows that us needs germany as a diplomatic partner . relations between the us and italy have cooled since former prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close bush ally , was defeated in april elections .
in addition , british prime tony blair 's attention is increasingly caught up with shoring up his failing popularity at home .
this leaves merkel as one of the dominant players on the us-europe stage , etges said . not everybody is thrilled by visit officials in mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is governed by a coalition of the center-left social democratic party and the far-left left party , are miffed that they might have to foot the bill for ballooning security costs and the deployment of some 12,500 police to the region . the feeling is that because merkel , a christian democrat , invited bush , the federal government should shoulder the majority of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald ringstorff thinks berlin should foot the bill for bush 's visit or as harald ringstorff , the state premier put it , " the one who orders the music should pay for it . " estimates for the entire security operation run from 11 to up to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 15 - 25 million -rrb- . waste of money ? the enormity of the sum for a two-day visit has horrified residents in stralsund , where unemployment fluctuates between 20 and 30 percent . for eginhard gieber , the manager of the st. nikolai evangelical church centre in stralsund , bush 's visit makes " no sense " given the " enormous poverty in the region . " " you could build a whole new children 's home with all that money , " he said . other residents are annoyed by the extensive security measures during the visit .
no cars are allowed to be parked in the historical city center ; bicycles have to be stored inside ; mail boxes will be sealed for the day ; and all outdoor flowerpots have to be dismantled . streets cleared for president 's visit despite their efforts , the majority of stralsund 's 58,000 residents wo n't get to see the president .
only 1,200 specially invited guests will be allowed to gather in the center . engineer heiko lawrenz from stralsund plans to escape to a building site for the day .
" you have to be inside from eight in the morning , and ca n't open a window or come out until the president leaves , " he fumed .
" i ca n't make any appointments , and it will impossible to work . " then of course , there is the thorny issue of bush 's politics .
" not much " was lawrenz 's response when asked what he thought of the us president . members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " are expecting thousands of anti-war campaigners to turn up on thursday .
however , monty schädel , one of the organizers , said that because stralsund is so out of the way , she expects the protest to be much smaller than the rallies held during bush 's visit to the central german town of mainz in february , 2005 .
then , an estimated 12,000 protesters took to the streets . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want merkel to press bush on prison camp closure germany 's social democrats are urging chancellor angela merkel to press us president george w. bush for a specific date on closing guantanamo bay prison in cuba when he visits germany on wednesday .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .
but woe to him if the team fails to qualify for that tournament , and dashes the hopes of millions of germans eager to renew 2006 's summer soccer love-fest . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- oktoberfest less boozy this year while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink .

so now , it is time to move on . a nation feels abandoned .
german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .
is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .
after all , löw inherits a fine team and a nation , which believes in itself and its soccer players , right ? uta thofern -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .

that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .
after all , löw inherits a fine team and a nation , which believes in itself and its soccer players , right ? uta thofern -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .

but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .

" no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .
already , 10 to 15 percent of the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- project has been spent in planning and preparation , vogel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco removes cologne cathedral from endangered list unesco has removed sites in europe , africa and asia from its list of world heritage sites that face man-made or natural threats , the united nations cultural body said monday .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .

at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world .

" the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley .

the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .
he bore the brunt of the media pressure before matches .
klinsmann enjoyed the laurels , or suffered the indignity of difficult questions afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new coach , same goals - top titles and just like klinsmann did at his first press conference as national coach in august 2004 , when he said germany would win the world cup , löw had similar words : " we want to become european champions -lrb- in 2008 -rrb- . " after the third-place finish in germany , the bravado in such a statement is naturally missing .
klinsmann has " cleared the path " that the team has to continue following , löw said during a news conference in frankfurt on wednesday . " only by doing this can we establish ourselves amongst the best teams in the world , " löw said . feels exhausted like klinsmann one of löw 's first tasks is to find an assistant .
the coaching and management staff is , for the most part , already there .
oliver bierhoff will be the manager .
andreas köpke will be the goalkeeper coach .
but the question as to who will be second-in-command remains open . " i will take a few days in peace to think about -lrb- who i will hire -rrb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw will now move to the center of cameramen 's attention löw has coached stuttgart and karlsruhe in germany , as well as fenerbahce istanbul and adanaspor in turkey , and fc tirol innsbruck and austria vienna in austria . during those assignments he won the title in austria and a german cup with stuttgart .
yet those honors probably do n't compare much with the experience of the past month .
they were not nearly as mentally and physically exhausting as this world cup .
he plans to first go on vacation to regain some strength - just like klinsmann .
but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .
it will be against a familiar opponent , sweden , whom germany knocked out of the world cup in the round of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newcomer podolski -lrb- l -rrb- provided offensive power that victory was symbolic of the new style of soccer that klinsmann had injected into the team .
within 12 minutes , newcomer of the tournament , lukas podolski , had put germany up 2-0 in a frenetic start , sending the crowd in munich into pandemonium .
german soccer fans had a team to be proud of . " they -lrb- the team -rrb- played the most beautiful and attractive soccer in this world cup , " he said . now , a nation hopes that jogi löw will continue what klinsmann started . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .

over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .

across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .

it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .

not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .
new germany as foundation for un agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche post , here the headquarters , helps upkeep bonn 's status while bonn and the german government preserved as much of the federal structure in the former capital as was possible , they also wanted to make it the fourth european home of the un after geneva , vienna and paris .
germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .
over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for annan and the un in bonn but bonn and germany are not stopping there .
angela merkel ’ s administration has committed germany to attracting other un institutions , a desire she repeated to kofi annan on tuesday in bonn .
across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .
currently it is unclear what it will be called but the city hopes the un will allow the name " united nations congress center . "
another 2,000 jobs are expected to be created through the center .

so now , it is time to move on . a nation feels abandoned .
german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .
is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .
after all , löw inherits a fine team and a nation , which believes in itself and its soccer players , right ? uta thofern -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .
he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw .
-lrb- july 12 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

now they 're going to catch up in germany us president george w. bush heads to german chancellor angela merkel 's constituency in former east germany on thursday for a visit that underlines the improving ties between the two leaders . merkel invited bush to visit her electoral ward in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania during a trip to washington earlier this year .
bush , accompanied by his wife laura , will arrive late on wednesday before meeting with merkel in the historical baltic port town of stralsund on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush visits to stralsund to see former eastern germany merkel said in an interview on rtl television on monday that it was important for bush to see for himself the " changes and problems " caused by the reunification of germany in 1990 . as well as stralsund , bush will also visit the neighboring towns of heiligendamm and trinwillershagen during his two-day stop-over before heading to the g8 summit in russia . merkel , who grew up in eastern germany , said bush 's trip would help " complete the picture " of the country . better personal relations dr. andreas etges from the berlin-based john f. kennedy institute for north america studies thinks bush 's visit to stralsund is a " definite sign of the improving personal relations between the two leaders . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder criticized the us-led war in iraq causing a cool relationship with bush " bush 's relationship with -lrb- former chancellor -rrb- gerhard schröder was beyond redemption , " said etges , " and this visit is a symbol that he is interested in merkel 's personal biography . " although the two disagree on issues such as the guantanamo bay prison , they have cooperated closely on trying to get iran to end its nuclear program . according to etges , bush 's visit also shows that us needs germany as a diplomatic partner . relations between the us and italy have cooled since former prime minister silvio berlusconi , a close bush ally , was defeated in april elections .
in addition , british prime tony blair 's attention is increasingly caught up with shoring up his failing popularity at home .
this leaves merkel as one of the dominant players on the us-europe stage , etges said . not everybody is thrilled by visit officials in mecklenburg-western pomerania , which is governed by a coalition of the center-left social democratic party and the far-left left party , are miffed that they might have to foot the bill for ballooning security costs and the deployment of some 12,500 police to the region . the feeling is that because merkel , a christian democrat , invited bush , the federal government should shoulder the majority of the costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald ringstorff thinks berlin should foot the bill for bush 's visit or as harald ringstorff , the state premier put it , " the one who orders the music should pay for it . " estimates for the entire security operation run from 11 to up to 20 million euros -lrb- $ 15 - 25 million -rrb- . waste of money ? the enormity of the sum for a two-day visit has horrified residents in stralsund , where unemployment fluctuates between 20 and 30 percent . for eginhard gieber , the manager of the st. nikolai evangelical church centre in stralsund , bush 's visit makes " no sense " given the " enormous poverty in the region . " " you could build a whole new children 's home with all that money , " he said . other residents are annoyed by the extensive security measures during the visit .
no cars are allowed to be parked in the historical city center ; bicycles have to be stored inside ; mail boxes will be sealed for the day ; and all outdoor flowerpots have to be dismantled . streets cleared for president 's visit despite their efforts , the majority of stralsund 's 58,000 residents wo n't get to see the president .
only 1,200 specially invited guests will be allowed to gather in the center . engineer heiko lawrenz from stralsund plans to escape to a building site for the day .
" you have to be inside from eight in the morning , and ca n't open a window or come out until the president leaves , " he fumed .
" i ca n't make any appointments , and it will impossible to work . " then of course , there is the thorny issue of bush 's politics .
" not much " was lawrenz 's response when asked what he thought of the us president . members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " are expecting thousands of anti-war campaigners to turn up on thursday .
however , monty schädel , one of the organizers , said that because stralsund is so out of the way , she expects the protest to be much smaller than the rallies held during bush 's visit to the central german town of mainz in february , 2005 .
then , an estimated 12,000 protesters took to the streets . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want merkel to press bush on prison camp closure germany 's social democrats are urging chancellor angela merkel to press us president george w. bush for a specific date on closing guantanamo bay prison in cuba when he visits germany on wednesday .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .
already , 10 to 15 percent of the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- project has been spent in planning and preparation , vogel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco removes cologne cathedral from endangered list unesco has removed sites in europe , africa and asia from its list of world heritage sites that face man-made or natural threats , the united nations cultural body said monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . " klinsmann had left his future with the team open immediately following the tournament , saying he needed a few days to digest the emotional experience , consider his professional options and talk with his family before making a decision that would , he said , be between his " heart and mind . " " my big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them , " the california-based klinsmann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.07.2006 berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a little north-south rivalry , berlin topped munich with its fan mile with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office . it was a cliche-buster , that 's for sure .
with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?

he will be replaced by his assistant , joachim löw . millions of german fans as well as the 23 players he coached during the world cup had hoped to keep klinsmann at the helm of the team he led to third place on home soil , but the 1990 world cup winner has decided not to extend his contract , he confirmed at a news conference on wednesday . " i want to thank everyone , especially the fans , who pushed us along to this fantastic success , " a visibly emotional klinsmann said . " it was the most beautiful world cup ever .
we 've created a new image of the germans around the world . " klinsmann had left his future with the team open immediately following the tournament , saying he needed a few days to digest the emotional experience , consider his professional options and talk with his family before making a decision that would , he said , be between his " heart and mind . " " my big wish is to go back to my family , to go back to leading a normal life with them , " the california-based klinsmann said .
" but another important reason is that after two years of putting a lot of energy into this , i feel that i lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands gathered in berlin to thank klinsmann and the german team though he may be a national hero now , klinsmann had a rough ride in germany in the run up to the world cup . two years ago , he was the third choice to take over the coaching job from rudi völler and regularly clashed with german soccer officials due to his decision to commute from his adopted home in california .
he also endured fierce criticism for his coaching methods , player selection and staff requests . the 41-year-old , who is married to an american and has two children , is also known to cherish the anonymity he has in the united states . " he is famous all over europe , " said bruce arena , the us coach and a friend of klinsmann 's .
" in california , he 's just another good-looking blond guy on the beach . " klinsmann has denied numerous rumors that he could take over the american team for arena , who has been on the us bench for the last eight years , but has not made any statements regarding his future plans .
before coaching germany he ran a soccer consulting firm . löw to replace klinsmann bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann and löw announced their decisions at a press conference in frankfurt on wednesday after short-lived speculation about who would replace klinsmann as german national coach , on wednesday it was announced that his assistant , joachim löw , would take over . klinsmann said he felt he had left a legacy that could be built upon and that löw was the best man to succeed him . " the only sensible option has been to ask joachim to lead them further , " he said .
" i am very glad that he has taken up this challenge . " löw , a former midfielder and bundesliga coach who worked closely with klinsmann over the past two years and comes from the same region in southwest germany , has agreed on a two-year contract to coach the team . the 46-year-old said he would continue with klinsmann 's approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.07.2006 berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a little north-south rivalry , berlin topped munich with its fan mile with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office . it was a cliche-buster , that 's for sure .
with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .
but woe to him if the team fails to qualify for that tournament , and dashes the hopes of millions of germans eager to renew 2006 's summer soccer love-fest . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- oktoberfest less boozy this year while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .

plans to build a bridge threaten the valley 's natural beauty , says the cultural body . the un cultural body , unesco , warned wednesday it could remove dresden 's elbe valley in eastern germany from the prestigious list of world heritage sites , which would be a first in the 34-year history of the list . " the world heritage committee decided that plans to build a bridge across the elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of the property 's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the world heritage list , " the world heritage committee , which is meeting in the lithuanian capital vilnius , said in a statement . " it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .
he bore the brunt of the media pressure before matches .
klinsmann enjoyed the laurels , or suffered the indignity of difficult questions afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new coach , same goals - top titles and just like klinsmann did at his first press conference as national coach in august 2004 , when he said germany would win the world cup , löw had similar words : " we want to become european champions -lrb- in 2008 -rrb- . " after the third-place finish in germany , the bravado in such a statement is naturally missing .
klinsmann has " cleared the path " that the team has to continue following , löw said during a news conference in frankfurt on wednesday . " only by doing this can we establish ourselves amongst the best teams in the world , " löw said . feels exhausted like klinsmann one of löw 's first tasks is to find an assistant .
the coaching and management staff is , for the most part , already there .
oliver bierhoff will be the manager .
andreas köpke will be the goalkeeper coach .
but the question as to who will be second-in-command remains open . " i will take a few days in peace to think about -lrb- who i will hire -rrb- , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw will now move to the center of cameramen 's attention löw has coached stuttgart and karlsruhe in germany , as well as fenerbahce istanbul and adanaspor in turkey , and fc tirol innsbruck and austria vienna in austria . during those assignments he won the title in austria and a german cup with stuttgart .
yet those honors probably do n't compare much with the experience of the past month .
they were not nearly as mentally and physically exhausting as this world cup .
he plans to first go on vacation to regain some strength - just like klinsmann .
but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .
it will be against a familiar opponent , sweden , whom germany knocked out of the world cup in the round of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newcomer podolski -lrb- l -rrb- provided offensive power that victory was symbolic of the new style of soccer that klinsmann had injected into the team .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .

at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .

" no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .

sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

" it therefore decided to inscribe dresden valley on the list of world heritage in danger with a view to also consider , in a prudent manner , delisting the site from the world heritage list in 2007 if the plans are carried through , " it added . the elbe valley , which stretches 18 kilometers -lrb- 11 miles -rrb- , was added to the world heritage list in 2004 . elbe valley joins 30 other threatened sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's baroque frauenkirche is a landmark in the city in its statement , unesco described the elbe valley as " an outstanding cultural landscape that integrates the celebrated baroque setting and suburban garden city into an artistic whole within the river valley . " no site has ever been removed from the world heritage list , which was established in 1972 and now numbers 812 natural and man-made sites around the world from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . with the addition of the elbe valley , the list of world heritage in danger now includes 31 properties .
earlier this week , the world heritage committee decided to remove four sites from the list : cologne cathedral in germany , hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . dresden mayor calls decision " harsh " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festung königstein , a fort from the 16th century , overlooks the elbe in a referendum in february 2005 , dresden voters overwhelmingly approved the construction of the bridge over the elbe river . the poll was legally binding and the unesco decision by no means would override the vote said dresden mayor lutz vogel . vogel said dresden regretted the placing of the elbe valley on the danger list , calling it a " harsh decision . " vogel has now called for an extraordinary session of the city council on july 20 to discuss the matter .
the bridge 's construction could be put up for another vote if two-thirds of the council members support doing so .
further delays entail rising costs .
already , 10 to 15 percent of the 160-million-euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- project has been spent in planning and preparation , vogel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco removes cologne cathedral from endangered list unesco has removed sites in europe , africa and asia from its list of world heritage sites that face man-made or natural threats , the united nations cultural body said monday .

the meeting , which opened tuesday , was attended by anthony brenton , the british ambassador to moscow , as well as two senior state department officials from washington .
the diplomats emphasized that their intention was not to meddle in russian domestic politics , but simply to gain another perspective . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world chess champion garry kasparov has led an opposition g8 conference criticism of putin 's russia as the g8 summit looms , even the western media is stepping up its criticism of democracy and human rights in putin 's russia .
the bush administration , particularly vice-president dick cheney , have been openly critical of moscow 's brutal suppression of the chechnya conflict , in which separatists have been battling russian forces for more than a decade now . the west has also criticized putin 's autocratic tendencies .
besides attacks on press freedoms , europeans and americans have expressed concerns about the virtual nationalization of key enterprises , such as the yukos oil giant , and russia 's lax business practices , such as lack of respect for intellectual property rights .
the europeans , who experienced a gas shortfall this past winter due to price disputes russia had with the ukraine , are also anxious about relying too heavily on moscow for their energy needs . exposing abuses of power the other russia opposition group , which also includes former prime minister mikhail kasyanov and two former kremlin advisers , says it wants to expose abuses of power in putin 's russia . " the official model imposed by the authorities is a monopoly over the economy , business , politics , ideology and civil society .
we stand for alternatives , the right of people to openly debate these alternatives , and freely choose for themselves " , said the kremlin 's former chief economic advisor , andrei illaryonov in an interview with the christian science monitor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister sergei lavrov -lrb- with german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- dismissed concerns of dissidents russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , however , dismissed the criticisms and said " certain people clearly find it hard to get used to the idea that russian has regained its strength and is once more to be reckoned with in world politics . " putin 's supporters have argued that issues such as human rights and press freedom need to be seen in perspective , considering that russia only emerged from soviet-style repression less than two decades ago .
the state no longer exercises control over the private lives if its citizens as it did in the former communist era .
today millions of russians have been able to travel abroad , operate their own businesses and own their own homes . common global issues they say that the g8 conference needs to be a forum to discuss issues of common interest , and should not be sidelined by internal dissidents . for russia , one of the key items on the summit agenda is its energy exports .
moscow wants guarantees from europe for its gas supplies , so that it can make long term investments .
europe and the us also view the opening of russian 's oil and gas supplies to foreign investment as essential to long-term stability . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meeting of g8 foreign ministers in moscow last month nuclear non-proliferation and strategies for dealing with north korea and iran are expected to dominate summit discussions , with the west favouring a tougher stance towards the rogue states than moscow . that does n't mean that criticism of what russia views as an internal matter will be off the agenda .
as secretary of state condoleezza rice told reporters at a news conference at a meeting of foreign ministers in moscow last month : " we believe we can raise anything among our g8 colleagues .
we wo n't hesitate to talk about our concerns about the freedom of the press , and we do so in a spirit of candor and cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.07.2006 microsoft faces eu 's wrath großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rift between the eu commission and microsoft is widening the european commission has slapped us software giant microsoft with a fine of 280.5 million euros -lrb- $ 356.2 million -rrb- for defying european anti-trust regulations . the european commission stepped up the pressure on microsoft wednesday to respect a 2004 antitrust ruling , by slapping the software maker with a new fine of 280.5 million euros or 1.5 million euros per day , backdated to dec .
15 last year .
that is the day brussels ended its grace period for microsoft to comply with demands to reveal source code to competitors . the fine is not as high as the possible 400 million euro penalty that could have been imposed , but the commission could slap future daily fines that run as high as three million euros per day , if microsoft still has not satisfied the eu regulators ' demands by the end of the month . it is not the first time that the american software maker based in redmond , washington has had to dig deep into its pockets to pay the eu .
in march 2004 , the commission levied a record fine of 497 million euros on the company for its failure to comply with orders to reveal source code to competitors .
the company paid that penalty in july of that year . long investigation finds microsoft in violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the windows operating system prevails on computers around the world the current case is a continuation of the quarrel whose roots date back to dec .
1998 .
at that time , the us software group sun microsystems filed a complaint against microsoft with the eu .
sun had alleged that microsoft was elbowing it out of the market by not giving access to develop programs that could communicate with microsoft products . over a year later , in feb .
2000 , brussels launched an investigation that found microsoft had broken eu law by using a quasi-monopoly in personal computer operating systems to thwart rivals . in addition to fining microsoft in march 2004 , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without bundling its media player software with it .
microsoft was also instructed to divulge the information needed by makers of rival products .
although microsoft paid the fine , it has fought tooth-and-nail over the information it is supposed to reveal to competitors . microsoft appeal trying eu 's patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european antitrust chief neelie kroes is leading the charge vs. microsoft microsoft 's two years of defiance has not sat well with eu competition commissioner neelie kroes who said on wednesday that she had " no alternative " but to fine microsoft . " no company is above the law .
any businesses operating in the eu must obey eu law , " she said . microsoft says that it is releasing reams of key computer code needed by programmers of rival products and claims that further fines are unfair .
microsoft also argues that if it is not complying with the decision , it is because the commission was too vague in the 2004 ruling about what the company needed to do . even while kroes was still presenting the fine to the press , microsoft shot back with plans to appeal in court . microsoft general counsel brad smith said that " we do not believe any fine , let alone a fine of this magnitude , is appropriate given the lack of clarity in the commission 's original decision and our good-faith efforts over the past two years . " " we will ask the european courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient and whether the commission 's unprecedented fine is justified , " he added . the microsoft standoff with brussels is testing not only eu regulators ' patience but also their authority .
the company challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april , but the judges are not expected to hand down a decision before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de microsoft , eu fire first shots in courtroom showdown us software giant microsoft opened a new chapter in its seven-year anti-trust standoff with eu regulators monday , urging a top eu court to quash a half-billion euro fine imposed by brussels .

with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .

fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .

germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .
over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for annan and the un in bonn but bonn and germany are not stopping there .
angela merkel ’ s administration has committed germany to attracting other un institutions , a desire she repeated to kofi annan on tuesday in bonn .
across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .
currently it is unclear what it will be called but the city hopes the un will allow the name " united nations congress center . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 12.07.2006 berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a little north-south rivalry , berlin topped munich with its fan mile with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office . it was a cliche-buster , that 's for sure .
with nary a dirndl or pair of lederhosen in sight , with soccer - not beer - as the main attraction , berlin 's fan mile managed to outstrip the munich oktoberfest and claim the title of party of the year . according to the german tourism office , nine million people flocked to the berlin boulevard where giant screens broadcast world cup matches .
in contrast , the annual oktoberfest in the southern city of munich only manages to attract a paltry six million visitors . the atmosphere at the fan mile was so friendly and peace-loving that a little old lady could have ventured into the crowds with her handbag dangling loosely and not have been robbed . by comparison , if you go to oktoberfest , you have to be prepared for hand-to-hand combat .
pickpockets abound , greeting each other by name , pointing out those easy targets who 've consumed the contents of one stein too many . hopes of a repeat performance in the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : must the oktoberfest in munich fear competition from berlin ?
fortunately for munich 's tourism industry , the world cup in germany was a one-off event that poses no threat to the bavarian city 's reputation as the party capital of germany . but wait a second - berlin 's mayor klaus woworeit has other thoughts .
no , he wo n't be able to conjure up a second world cup next summer .
but so impressed was he with the success of the fan mile , that he has suggested reviving the experience for future events that " will again move the masses . " the question is , what event has the ability to move the masses quite like the world cup ?
cleverly sticking to the sports theme , wowereit suggested the 2008 european championships being played in austria and switzerland - at least on those days when germany plays . this naturally adds a new dimension to the job description of germany 's new national coach joachim ' jogi ' löw : give us exciting soccer so that germans can continue to feel good about themselves .
but woe to him if the team fails to qualify for that tournament , and dashes the hopes of millions of germans eager to renew 2006 's summer soccer love-fest . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de public viewing takes on new dimension at world cup do n't have a ticket ?
no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums .
-lrb- june 29 , 2006 -rrb- oktoberfest less boozy this year while still far away from being a gathering of teetotalers , alcoholic consumption at this year 's oktoberfest fell from last year .
some say new regulations on music volume dampened the mood to drink .

so now , it is time to move on . a nation feels abandoned .
german coach jürgen klinsmann , the beacon of hope , the hero , is deserting us .
is this jürgen klinsmann , the same man denounced for his super-ego , for being a quitter , and a weakling ?
a man , who is terrified of his first defeat , who dreads what the next international tournament , the european championships , will bring , after the intoxication of the world cup on home soil ? the initial public reaction looks different .
it 's not klinsmann , who bears the brunt of criticism , but those who made his life hell in preparation for the world cup , from the german soccer federation to the tabloids .
there were so many who did not believe in him , and who poked fun at his new methods , his residency in california , and his unshakable sunny boy optimism . fickle public opinion not linked to departure the public believes that these naysayers , who are now entreating klinsmann to stay , would of course pounce on him again , the minute success abandons him .
but that 's not why he is leaving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating the third place finish .
klinsmann -lrb- middle -rrb- on berlin 's fan mile for now , the klinsmann mystique stretches far enough afield to make even his resignation shine , though many already believe that the euphoria he unleashed with his german team will not necessarily last . so now has come the time to leave on a high note .
has n't this world cup changed our view of ourselves , and made us self-confident ?
have n't we learned that achieving a third place finish can be celebrated as a victory ?
that every defeat is a new opening , and that for every ending , there is a new beginning ? the klinsmann principle whoever now believes that those eternal defeatists , in their typically negative german way , have made our coach grow white hairs , has neither understood the klinsmann principle nor jürgen klinsmann , the man . klinsmann is leaving now , possibly for personal reasons , but above all , because he has finished a chapter of his extraordinary career as player and coach , and wants to move on . one lesson that we germans can learn from mr. klinsmann is this : mobility and flexibility have nothing to do with being superficial and uncaring .
not wanting to be tied down by time restraints - in klinsmann 's case , having the option to set his own terms and not to prolong his contract , does not mean a lesser commitment to the goal at hand .
professional success and a sense of personal well-being are not incompatible , but complement each other . the courage to take the road less travelled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new national coach joachim löw -lrb- right -rrb- to continue klinsmann 's legacy one german business consultant calls it " post-heroic management . "
jürgen klinsmann , the multi-lingual globetrotter with small-town swabian roots , is the model for it .
the era of tough men who sweat it out until the last drop , and who find the battle more important than the finish , is over .
results count , and they can also be attained with charm and tactics , but above all with a new perspective and the courage to depart from old ways .
the ability to change is a prerequisite . it is perfectly normal for a professional like jürgen klinsmann to call it quits .
and for us germans , it should also be normal to believe in his successor , joachim löw .
after all , löw inherits a fine team and a nation , which believes in itself and its soccer players , right ? uta thofern -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coach klinsmann calls it quits in germany days after leading germany to third place in the 2006 world cup with a young team he personally put together , coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to step down .

the un campus inauguration proved the doubters were wrong . on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel and united nations secretary general kofi annan were in bonn to open the new un campus that will house 11 of 12 un organizations and more than 600 employees that are based in bonn .
the largest agency is un volunteers , which supports sustainable human development worldwide by promoting volunteerism .
the " langer eugen " - the building which formerly accommodated the offices of german parliamentarians up until 1999 - is also home to agencies which combat desertification and preserve migratory species .
next year , the un climate change secretariat , whose largest responsibility is managing the kyoto protocol , will move in across the street from another location in bonn .
the historical significance of langer eugen and the glass bundestag , where merkel , annan and bonn ’ s mayor bärbel dieckmann held their opening speeches on tuesday in front of german politicians and un workers , can not be underestimated .
it was in these buildings that german democracy was born and cultivated after world war ii .
it was from there that democratic west germans thought democratic west germany would be ruled for decades to come .
bonn on the verge of insignificance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un headquarters : the rhine and lots of financial support in background when communism in eastern and central europe collapsed in 1989 , germany was at the center of the new order .
thoughts and desires of berlin as the capital of reunified germany came to the fore , while bonn - the sleepy , little town on the rhine and the birthplace of beethoven - would seemingly become a forsaken bride .
and it happened .
on june 20 , 1991 , the bundestag narrowly voted by a 338 to 320 margin to move the capital back to berlin .
the outcry of those who had wished to keep the capital in the rhineland was unmistakable .
the federal government under helmut kohl , however , was committed to helping bonn overcome what was thought would be the loss of thousands of government jobs .
parliament passed the bonn-berlin act in 1994 to set the framework for the support so that bonn ’ s economic structure wouldn ’ t whither away .
bonn ’ s proponents pushed measures through so that six federal ministries and over 10,000 government employees would remain there .
that is compared to just fewer than 9,000 civil servants in berlin .
a generous compensation the generous compensation agreement passed together with the bonn-berlin act provided a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.78 billion -rrb- infusion of capital into the city and the region around it .
the former state-run telephone and postal monopolies , now deutsche telekom and deutsche post , have been partially privatized and retained their headquarters in bonn , attracting well-educated , middle-class workers .
" bonn has managed the structural change .
the birthplace of beethoven is a un city , and an important economic , scientific and cultural location , " mayor bärbel dieckmann has said recently .
further proof of this is the below-average unemployment rate of 8.2 percent and a german city whose population is actually growing .
new germany as foundation for un agencies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche post , here the headquarters , helps upkeep bonn 's status while bonn and the german government preserved as much of the federal structure in the former capital as was possible , they also wanted to make it the fourth european home of the un after geneva , vienna and paris .
germany ’ s history of aid to the developing world and its environment-friendly reputation were natural points to focus on .
in 1995 , germany convinced the international body to base offices of the un volunteers and the un framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- in bonn based on germany ’ s commitments to those areas .
one year later , then environment minister angela merkel and former un secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali laid the cornerstone for the un volunteers and the unfccc building in their new home , the historic haus carstanjen in bonn .
more agencies came to the city so that the un quickly outgrew the building .
the un on the move when parliamentarians vacated their buildings in bonn ’ s government quarter in the summer of 1999 , the negotiations began for the un to move in .
over 50 million euros were spent to renovate the new headquarters for the un-based agencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red carpet treatment for annan and the un in bonn but bonn and germany are not stopping there .
angela merkel ’ s administration has committed germany to attracting other un institutions , a desire she repeated to kofi annan on tuesday in bonn .
across from the un campus , the foundations of a 140 million euro convention center are being laid .
currently it is unclear what it will be called but the city hopes the un will allow the name " united nations congress center . "
another 2,000 jobs are expected to be created through the center .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .
he bore the brunt of the media pressure before matches .
klinsmann enjoyed the laurels , or suffered the indignity of difficult questions afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new coach , same goals - top titles and just like klinsmann did at his first press conference as national coach in august 2004 , when he said germany would win the world cup , löw had similar words : " we want to become european champions -lrb- in 2008 -rrb- . " after the third-place finish in germany , the bravado in such a statement is naturally missing .
klinsmann has " cleared the path " that the team has to continue following , löw said during a news conference in frankfurt on wednesday . " only by doing this can we establish ourselves amongst the best teams in the world , " löw said . feels exhausted like klinsmann one of löw 's first tasks is to find an assistant .
the coaching and management staff is , for the most part , already there .
oliver bierhoff will be the manager .
andreas köpke will be the goalkeeper coach .
but the question as to who will be second-in-command remains open .

yet those honors probably do n't compare much with the experience of the past month .
they were not nearly as mentally and physically exhausting as this world cup .
he plans to first go on vacation to regain some strength - just like klinsmann .
but he knows the players , particularly the younger ones , also have gone through a mind-numbing experience . " it will be important to make sure the young players do n't fall into a hole , " löw said .
" we noticed last year after the confederations cup that it is n't always so easy to have a good start to the season after such a strenuous tournament . " " most attractive soccer in the tournament " the time for relaxation will be short-lived for löw .
once he has found an assistant , his staff will have to prepare for löw 's first friendly match as coach in august .
it will be against a familiar opponent , sweden , whom germany knocked out of the world cup in the round of 16 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newcomer podolski -lrb- l -rrb- provided offensive power that victory was symbolic of the new style of soccer that klinsmann had injected into the team .

now , the 46-year old swabian has been handed the reins and his goals are as ambitious as his predecessor 's . jürgen klinsmann returned to the german national team in august 2004 , and announced that within two years , germany would again be at the top of the soccer world and win the world cup in their own country .
this came after the disastrous euro 2004 performance in which germany crashed out in the first round . it was an incredibly ambitious goal that almost incredibly panned out . standing next to him the whole time was his mild-mannered assistant , joachim ' jogi ' löw .
directly before every national game , it was löw who presented the line-up on german television .

the 178-nation " happy planet index " lists the south pacific island of vanuatu as the happiest nation on the planet , while the uk is ranked 108th .
the index is based on consumption levels , life expectancy and happiness , rather than national economic wealth measurements such as gdp .
the study was compiled by think-tank the new economics foundation -lrb- nef -rrb- .
size does n't matter one of the authors , nef 's nic marks , said the aim of the index was to show that well-being did not have to be linked to high levels of consumption .
' happiest place on earth ' population : 209,000 gdp / capita : $ 2,900 -lrb- £ 1,575 -rrb- climate : tropical resources : forests , fish economy : agriculture , tourism environmental issues : deforestation and clean water source : cia handbook 2006 country profile of vanuatu " it is clear that no single nation listed in the index has got everything right , but it does reveal patterns that show how we might better achieve long and happy lives for all while living within our environmental means , " mr marks said .
the small island state of vanuatu is situated in the middle of the south pacific ocean , and has a population of 209,000 .
its economy is built around small-scale agriculture and tourism .
latin american nations dominate the top 10 places in the index , while african and eastern european nations fill most of the bottom 10 .
among the world 's largest economies , germany is ranked 81st , japan 95th , while the us comes in at 150th .
richard layard , director of the well-being programme at the london school of economics ' centre for economic performance , said that the index was an interesting way to tackle the issue of modern life 's environmental impact .
" it reminds us that it is not good enough to be happy today if we are impoverishing future generations through global warming .
" over the last 50 years , living standards in the west have improved enormously but we have become no happier , " mr layard told the bbc .
" this shows we should not sacrifice human relationships , which are the main source of happiness , for the sake of economic growth . "
although vanuatu tops the happiness index , it is ranked 207th out of 233 economies when measured against gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
simon bullock , economics co-ordinator for friends of the earth , which helped compile the data , said the findings showed that happiness did not have to cost the earth .
" the uk economy hoovers up vast quantities of the world 's scarce resources , yet british people are no happier than colombians , who use far fewer , " he said .
" the current crude focus on gdp is outdated , destructive and does n't deliver a better quality of life . "
nef is calling for the adoption of a " global manifesto for a happier planet " that will list ways nations can live within their environmental limits and increase people 's quality of life .
the recommendations include : eradicating extreme poverty and hunger recognising the contribution of individuals and unpaid work ensuring economic policies stay within environmental limits the index builds on a report that nef published earlier this year that warned if annual global consumption levels matched the uk 's , it would take 3.1 earths to meet the demand .

immigration minister liam byrne asked officials to report on the issues surrounding the controversial idea .
now he has rejected the move and instead will unveil plans for " fair but tough " enforcement of existing rules .
meanwhile , campaigners for an amnesty have said it is unrealistic to think that about half a million " irregular migrants " can readily be deported .
when john reid became home secretary in may he said the immigration and nationality directorate was " not fit for purpose " and ordered a review of how things were done .
his criticisms followed the crisis over more than 1,000 foreign prisoners who were released without being considered for deportation .
an immigration chief also admitted little effort was made to track down illegal immigrants who lose touch with the authorities .
' tools for the job ' mr byrne said the review of the immigration and nationality directorate -lrb- ind -rrb- was almost complete .
" we can say that we will be ruling out an amnesty and will be instead bringing forward plans over the next two weeks for fair but tough enforcement of the rules , " he said .
" we 'll not only strengthen our people but the tools they have to do the job . "
" it 's a political reality that around half a million irregular migrants ca n't readily be deported " habib rahman joint council for the welfare of immigrants mr byrne stressed the immigration department had made progress , with asylum applications down 72 % from their 2002 peak and more failed claimants being deported .
" that did n't happen by accident .
it took a lot of people a lot of hard work , " he said .
" we will be pressing on , not going backwards . "
amnesty plans the government estimates there are up to 570,000 illegal immigrants in the uk .
mr byrne 's decision to rule out an amnesty came as a campaign group published detailed proposals for the move .
the joint council for the welfare of immigrants -lrb- jcwi -rrb- said illegal immigrants who had been in the uk for at least two years should be allowed to stay .
and any illegal immigrants with no serious criminal record should be given the right to stay permanently after they had spent seven years in britain , it said .
habib rahman , chief executive of the council , said a solution to the illegal immigrants in the country had to be found now .
" it 's a political reality that around half a million irregular migrants ca n't readily be deported and eu migration alone can not be relied on to fill the jobs many of them are doing , " he said .
" it 's time to get real - put this beyond politics and start talking practical solutions .
" in the end a system that denies full rights to all migrants in the uk is both socially unjust and is creating losers all round . "
the report comes after migrationwatch uk claimed it would take 20 or 30 years to build enough social housing for illegal immigrants if there was an amnesty .
commenting on the government 's move , liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark hunter said : " after casting about in the dark for answers , the government has once again been forced to abandon its proposals in the face of opposition .
" what 's required is a considered immigration policy which looks constructively at the criteria by which we allow people to stay in britain . "

on breakfast we looked at what happens when neighbourliness is n't present - and what can be done to restore it david sillito meets a woman who has n't spoken to her neighbour for 20 years .
david met sue , from rotheram , who , these days speaks only to her family and one friend .
she feels that it 's best that way as people where she lives are not neighbourly anymore .
sue does n't chat to her neighbours the designer wayne hemmingway , who has been involved in town planning , about how the potential for neighbourliness can be built in to building designs .
he said that cars were to blame for much of the decline in neighbourliness .
we 've allowed the car lobby to give us buildings and house-plannners to give us housing developments that are dominated by the car and it 's clearly daft wayne hemmingway , building for life as chair of building for life , wayne has been involved in a project called home zone , which aims to reduce the dominance of the car in neighbourhoods and gives priority to pedestrians and cyclists .
this , he says , creates happier neighbourhoods and happier streets as people get more opportunities to meet one another if they do n't come straight out of their front door and get into a car parked on the drive .
our feature on neighbours who do n't talk and interview with wayne hemmingway , of building for life david sillito looks at how the internet is bringing mums together on wednesday , david sillito found out how the internet is helping new mothers beat loneliness , isolation and depression .
the days are long gone when a mothers ' mafia ruled the neighbourhood with a network of garden fence gossip .
these days , more than half of us do n't even know our neighbours ' names .
that may not matter when you 're out at work all day .
but , when you 're at home with a tiny baby , you can suddenly feel isolated and imprisoned .
today , david sillito looked at how going online has helped create " virtual communities " for new mums .
when they decide to have children , many people decide to up sticks and move to a nice , quiet neighbourhood .
but what happens when it 's too quiet , when the only passers by seem to be in cars and when it feels as though you are the only mum in the area ?
netmums you ca n't go up to someone and say - will you be my friend ?
for donna heaton motherhood was lonely , scary and it destroyed her confidence .
she had returned to her home town of rotherham expecting to be surrounded by friends but once she had a toddler she found herself very isolated .
the solution for her was to go online .
the website netmums is a social networking site for mums and helps mothers find people to talk to in their own neighbourhood .
netmums some of donna 's new friends found they were talking online to people who were only a few doors away .
they 'd seen each other in the street but were too nervous to say hello .
finding a friend as one mum said ' you ca n't go up to someone and say ' will you be my friend . '
the question is why so many women feel so isolated .
among the group i talked to , some said that people simply do n't socialise with neighbours anymore .
and several said that they had had to move from town to town and found it hard to meet new people .
underneath it all was a feeling that the old support system of relatives who used to live nearby had disappeared .
so too have the streets where everyone knows each other 's business .
in some ways that 's a relief , but for those unable to get out there was huge relief that the computer offered an online alternative to the garden fence .

on breakfast we looked at what happens when neighbourliness is n't present - and what can be done to restore it david sillito meets a woman who has n't spoken to her neighbour for 20 years .
david met sue , from rotheram , who , these days speaks only to her family and one friend .
she feels that it 's best that way as people where she lives are not neighbourly anymore .
sue does n't chat to her neighbours the designer wayne hemmingway , who has been involved in town planning , about how the potential for neighbourliness can be built in to building designs .
he said that cars were to blame for much of the decline in neighbourliness .
we 've allowed the car lobby to give us buildings and house-plannners to give us housing developments that are dominated by the car and it 's clearly daft wayne hemmingway , building for life as chair of building for life , wayne has been involved in a project called home zone , which aims to reduce the dominance of the car in neighbourhoods and gives priority to pedestrians and cyclists .
this , he says , creates happier neighbourhoods and happier streets as people get more opportunities to meet one another if they do n't come straight out of their front door and get into a car parked on the drive .
our feature on neighbours who do n't talk and interview with wayne hemmingway , of building for life david sillito looks at how the internet is bringing mums together on wednesday , david sillito found out how the internet is helping new mothers beat loneliness , isolation and depression .
the days are long gone when a mothers ' mafia ruled the neighbourhood with a network of garden fence gossip .
these days , more than half of us do n't even know our neighbours ' names .
that may not matter when you 're out at work all day .
but , when you 're at home with a tiny baby , you can suddenly feel isolated and imprisoned .
today , david sillito looked at how going online has helped create " virtual communities " for new mums .
when they decide to have children , many people decide to up sticks and move to a nice , quiet neighbourhood .
but what happens when it 's too quiet , when the only passers by seem to be in cars and when it feels as though you are the only mum in the area ?
netmums you ca n't go up to someone and say - will you be my friend ?
for donna heaton motherhood was lonely , scary and it destroyed her confidence .
she had returned to her home town of rotherham expecting to be surrounded by friends but once she had a toddler she found herself very isolated .
the solution for her was to go online .
the website netmums is a social networking site for mums and helps mothers find people to talk to in their own neighbourhood .
netmums some of donna 's new friends found they were talking online to people who were only a few doors away .
they 'd seen each other in the street but were too nervous to say hello .
finding a friend as one mum said ' you ca n't go up to someone and say ' will you be my friend . '
the question is why so many women feel so isolated .
among the group i talked to , some said that people simply do n't socialise with neighbours anymore .
and several said that they had had to move from town to town and found it hard to meet new people .
underneath it all was a feeling that the old support system of relatives who used to live nearby had disappeared .
so too have the streets where everyone knows each other 's business .
in some ways that 's a relief , but for those unable to get out there was huge relief that the computer offered an online alternative to the garden fence .

the energy review , revealed on tuesday , recommended further study of the £ 14bn project , but said it would raise " strong environmental concerns " .
friends of the earth cymru said that amounted to a rejection of assembly government support for the barrier .
but welsh enterprise minister andrew davies said he was delighted there would be a study of severn tidal power .
how tide power works as tide comes in , sea water passes through barrage to landward side at high tide , sluice gates shut , trapping water in estuary or basin when tide recedes on sea-side of barrage , sluice gates open water flows through barrage , driving turbines and generating power power can be generated in both directions , but this can affect efficiency and economics of project the 10-mile -lrb- 16km -rrb- barrier would run from lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down , near weston-super-mare .
it is estimated it could provide about 5 % of the uk 's energy needs by 2020 .
gordon james of friends of the earth cymru said it was " particularly pleased that the environmentally destructive and costly severn barrage proposal has not won favour " .
he added : " we were always surprised that the welsh assembly government supported such a scheme when more cost-effective and environmentally acceptable options , such as tidal lagoons , look more promising . "
the rspb also welcomed the uk government 's recognition of the river severn 's environmental value .
the charity said the estuary was " prized " for its importance to wild birds , particularly in winter and during migration , and was of " international importance " . "
a barrage across the severn estuary could generate massive amounts of clean , green energy " welsh secretary peter hain the energy review stated that while the barrier was " attractive in terms of energy generation , " it would " raise strong environmental concerns " .
the report went on to recommend further study of " tidal technologies " and their " public acceptability " to use in the estuary .
but welsh secretary peter hain said no other renewable energy project came close to the proposed tidal barrier .
" a barrage across the severn estuary could generate massive amounts of clean , green energy - up to 5 % of the uk 's energy needs , " he said .
" the review starkly illustrates the huge challenge we face if we want to achieve energy security over the coming years - and the need for us to make tough choices . "
mr davies said he was pleased the uk government wanted further research .
" the assembly government fully intends to play a full part in taking this work forward to its next stages .
we recognise there is more work to be done , " he added .

the commission on unclaimed assets is set to call for a " social bank " to be created to manage handing the cash over to charities and voluntary projects .
it follows calls from the chancellor for such money to be put to good use .
an estimated £ 400m is thought to be lying unclaimed in bank accounts that have not been touched for 10 years .
in his pre-budget statement chancellor gordon brown said a deal had been struck with banks and building societies to use these unclaimed assets to fund new youth and community facilities .
new bank however , the commission 's report is widely expected to call instead for the money to fund a new institution which will then lend money to smaller charities relying on donations to keep going .
the proposals will be set out in a 16-page document which will be published on wednesday , followed by a six month consultation period .
however , the subsequent discussions will not be able to examine the technical aspects of the plans , such as the legal implications for consumer protection .
meanwhile , banks and building societies are said to be undecided about how long accounts should lie dormant before the funds are used - with reports suggesting any period of between three and 20 years .
the commission - which was set up by the scarman trust and is backed by several other charitable groups , including the rowntree foundation - aims to help the uk make the most of the unclaimed assets in uk accounts .
a spokesman for the treasury said it would examine the commission 's ideas " in detail " , but stressed that the report was done independently of the government .
the commission is expected to release its report at 1000 bst on wednesday .

they found evidence that nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is associated with high intake of sugar , alcohol , oils and meat .

i can understand why mother nature might do this dr maggie blott morning sickness occurs in the first three months of up to 80 % of pregnancies .
until recently , it was thought to be simply an unfortunate by-product of dramatic hormonal changes during early pregnancy .
however , research has suggested that morning sickness might have positive consequences - such as a reduced risk of miscarriage .
toxins the researchers believe it is possible that the pregnant human body may have evolved an aversion to foods containing high levels of toxins , and that this may have carried over into modern living .
they suggest that the body might reject meat because of the relatively high risk that it might harbour disease-causing agents .
conversely , the low level of plant toxins in cereals may make them particularly unlikely to trigger nausea .
however , they say the body 's rejection of sugars and oils is less easy to explain .
lead researcher dr craig roberts said : " while there may be no particular harm in eating , say , meat , now that we have refrigeration and best before dates , our bodies may be pre-programmed by evolution to avoid these particular foodstuffs in the first trimester .

to babel and back is partly based in his home town porthcawl , but also draws on travels to iraq and argentina , with nuclear and political themes .
the shortlist also included a first novel and a poetry collection .
the welsh language prize , also worth £ 10,000 , was won by rhys evans for his biography of plaid cymru 's first mp gwynfor evans , who died in 2005 .
neath-born minhinnick , who is editor of poetry wales , said his book was a collection of essays , observations and stories " both real and imagined " .
it also has a thread of his own personal journey , following depleted uranium to iraq .
one of the more disturbing extracts of the book , which takes in political , nuclear and environmental themes , details a day trip he took to babylon .
he was taken to a bunker where 400 people burned to death after an american smart bomb in the first gulf war had exploded .
rhys evans worked through boxes of personal files and papers minhinnick thought he saw bats hanging from the ceiling .
" after my guides had taken me through the bunker they said those blackened shapes were children 's hands , " he said .
" parents had held the children up to the ceiling to help them dig for safety from the fire but instead their hands became fused to the burning hot ceiling .
" after , they tried to pull the bodies from the bunker but the hands remained stuck to the ceiling . "
minhinnick said he was surprised the book even made the shortlist , as the judges had thought it " patchy " .
he said it was a demanding and difficult book .
" but once you start on page one you continue until 200 , so it 's well worth it , " he added .
also nominated were swedish-born kitty sewell for her first novel ice trap , and poet ifor thomas , who drew on his experience of being treated for prostate cancer .
the welsh language prize was won by bbc wales journalist rhys evans for his biography of gwynfor evans , his first book .
he said it was sparked by his own " obsession " for the subject , backed up by painstaking research of boxes of papers and letters belonging to the former carmarthen mp , who died aged 92 in april 2005 .
but he admitted that being a first-time author had been tough .
" bit of a curate 's egg really , at times extremely painful and very tiring , given that i did it as a part-time project in my spare time , " he explained .

the shortlist also included a first novel and a poetry collection .
the welsh language prize , also worth £ 10,000 , was won by rhys evans for his biography of plaid cymru 's first mp gwynfor evans , who died in 2005 .
neath-born minhinnick , who is editor of poetry wales , said his book was a collection of essays , observations and stories " both real and imagined " .
it also has a thread of his own personal journey , following depleted uranium to iraq .
one of the more disturbing extracts of the book , which takes in political , nuclear and environmental themes , details a day trip he took to babylon .
he was taken to a bunker where 400 people burned to death after an american smart bomb in the first gulf war had exploded .
rhys evans worked through boxes of personal files and papers minhinnick thought he saw bats hanging from the ceiling .

many said the terror strike again exposed india as a state which is soft on terror .
others said india 's financial capital would soldier on in spite of the attacks .
the papers splashed pictures of mangled coaches - one paper had a moving photograph of a blood-splattered victim trying to call his family on his mobile phone from his hospital bed .
" terrible tuesday " , is the headline in the indian express - which takes in the explosions in mumbai as well as in indian-administered kashmir .
in an angry editorial , the paper said the federal government led by the congress party " does n't quite know how hard it should be on terror . "
the message that india will be intolerant of terror and will hunt perpetrators is n't being effectively put out ..
the indian express " something must be seriously wrong with our domestic intelligence apparatus that we almost never apprehend those who kill in the name of politics and faith , " the newspaper said .
" bluntly put , the message that india will be intolerant of terror and will hunt perpetrators is n't being effectively put out ... "
" citizens may soon reach a verdict though .
they may argue that while trying to make communal political capital out of terror is dangerous and unsupportable , trying to finesse terror so as to sound ' politically correct ' is unacceptable " .
' have terrorists declared war on india ? ' asked the statesman .
" could this be the start of something much bigger ?
in other words , not terrorism in kashmir but a full-fledged terrorist war against india ? " , the newspaper said in a comment piece .
" if that is so , the elements that back the so-called jihadis are making their final , desperate attempt .
and they might get much more than they bargained for . "
the tribune was more direct in its editorial .
" while pakistan needs to be warned against the consequences of abetting terrorism , all-out efforts are necessary to eliminate those who perpetrated the crime , " it said .
' terror at rush hour ' , headlined hindustan times .
the newspaper said the blasts came as an attack on the " face of globalising mumbai " , and were planned along a 60km stretch of the city which houses the " city 's affluent suburbs " .
' scary , ungovernable city ' ' bombed , not bowed ' , headlined the economic times highlighting the spirit of the city 's people .
the newspaper said that last year 's monsoon floods in the city and tuesday 's train explosions could destroy the confidence of its people .
" together , they are likely to reinforce mumbai 's growing image as a scary , ungovernable city with creaky infrastructure and even poorer security " .
separately , in an editorial , the newspaper said the fabled " mumbai spirit " must prevail in the aftermath of the blasts .
" police deployment has been stepped up , but fundamentally the links between the major communities , both at an economic and at a human level , are too deep to be rent asunder by the lunatic acts of a bunch of fanatics . "
the pioneer said the nature of recent terror strikes in india had a " clear pattern : destabilise the nation 's growth and trigger communal clashes . "
but there is also optimism that mumbai will manage to surmount the challenges it faces .
the indian express predicts that mumbai " choked by a terrible administration , already a target of terrorism more than once , still india 's economic capital ... will find a way . "
" but the government will have nothing to do with it " .

in the latest incident , on monday , a 26-year-old man was shoved from his bike in abingdon , south of oxford .
he sustained bruising and cuts to his knees , elbows and hips .
oxford-based pressure group cyclox believes angry drivers are targeting cyclists .
police are investigating links between the attacks .
cyclox spokesman james styring said : " there are more people taking to their bikes because of summer and maybe motorists get annoyed with their ability to skip traffic queues .
" although it may seem like an amusing summer activity driving along and pushing people off their bikes , if someone breaks their neck you could be facing a murder charge . "
white van thames valley police believe the latest attack near the ox public house on the a4183 on monday could be linked to two others in south oxfordshire .
the first known attack was on a 32-year-old woman , who had abuse hurled at her and was punched by two men travelling in passing cars as she cycled along the banbury road in summertown , north oxford , on the morning of 12 june .
in mid-june , a 68-year-old man was pushed off his bike by someone in a small white van on the b4009 just outside princes risborough .
the victim of monday 's attack told police he remembered hearing a diesel engine and glimpsing a white vehicle , possibly a van , passing him .
pc lewis boyce , investigating the abingdon incident , said : " i am aware that there have been a number of similar incidents involving cyclists being pushed from their bikes and i will be looking into these to see if there are any clear links .

white van thames valley police believe the latest attack near the ox public house on the a4183 on monday could be linked to two others in south oxfordshire .
the first known attack was on a 32-year-old woman , who had abuse hurled at her and was punched by two men travelling in passing cars as she cycled along the banbury road in summertown , north oxford , on the morning of 12 june .
in mid-june , a 68-year-old man was pushed off his bike by someone in a small white van on the b4009 just outside princes risborough .
the victim of monday 's attack told police he remembered hearing a diesel engine and glimpsing a white vehicle , possibly a van , passing him .
pc lewis boyce , investigating the abingdon incident , said : " i am aware that there have been a number of similar incidents involving cyclists being pushed from their bikes and i will be looking into these to see if there are any clear links .
" this is no prank .
falling from a cycle could easily cause a serious injury and could even prove fatal , particularly if the cyclist were to fall into the path of an oncoming vehicle . "
