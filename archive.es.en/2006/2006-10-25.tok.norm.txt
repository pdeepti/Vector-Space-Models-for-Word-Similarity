but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2006 german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch , center , said rising right-wing violence in germany is disturbing the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era . " anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .
-lrb- 23.12.2005 -rrb- european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism .

one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .

" governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation .

" we regret if member states who have opened for the 10 are not going to open for romania and bulgaria , " said katharina von schnurbein , the eu executive 's spokeswoman for employment and social affairs . " the economic implications have been very positive in the first two years after the last enlargement , " she said .
" we think that this is definitely a positive that should be taken into account . " poland , scandinavia willing to open doors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states have differing views when it comes to foreign workers however it was n't all bad news for the open-access supporters . poland , the biggest newcomer in 2004 , announced that it would open its jobs market to workers from all european union member states as well as those from iceland , liechtenstein and norway , " we hope that our position will be an impetus to countries that are still hesitating , " deputy labor minister kazimierz kuberski said . fellow newcomers slovakia , estonia , and latvia , plus the more-established finland , have all promised to allow unfettered access to the new arrivals next year . sweden granted full access to new eu workers in 2004 , and prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has indicated he is unlikely to introduce tighter restrictions for romania and bulgaria . other eu states still on the fence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of nations have yet to announce their plans for new workers many other member states have yet to announce a decision on the matter , with some adopting a wait-and-see approach as fellow eu members line up in the free-access or restrictions camps . " it 's not a decision that we want to take alone , " said an italian foreign ministry spokesman , " we are waiting to see what recommendations brussels has on the question , " he told afp . other core eu states such as belgium , france , the netherlands and spain are also in the " do n't know " or at least the " have n't said " camps . hundreds of thousands of workers from romania and bulgaria , which will become the eu 's poorest members , crossed eu borders after the fall of the communist bloc in the late 1980s , entering illegally but hoping to later go legal . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.10.2006 german cabinet approves contentious health reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a political health care compromise was nearly as difficult as a triple bypass the german cabinet wednesday approved sweeping health care reforms that have threatened to split the country 's ruling grand coalition .
critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- medical tourism growth industry in germany it might be the country 's own favorite bugbear , but german health care enjoys an excellent reputation abroad , both in terms of quality and cost .
medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it .
-lrb- 23.09.2006 -rrb- german health insurers tempt customers with incentives as germany wrestles over reforming its health care system , insurance providers aim to cut costs by encouraging their insured to lead healthy lifestyles .
not bad , many believe , but who pays for the incentives ? -lrb- 13.09.2006 -rrb- feedback should the coalition government have made other changes to germany 's health care system ?

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .

" governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation .

critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .
-lrb- 23.12.2005 -rrb- european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .
the ministers are to hold a press conference and the home office website plans to publish the results of the talks . sarah ludford , a member of the european parliament and spokesperson on european justice for britain 's liberal democrat opposition party , fears however that a " cabal " of officials within the european union may be short-circuiting what she says is an already limited democratic process in forging eu security policy . " de facto , i think they are making decisions , " ludford said .
" it 's a short-hand way of arriving eventually at eu legislation .

" governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society .

" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead . " " runs counter to our values " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung in the published photos , the uniformed men are seen holding up the skull and posing with it on a jeep like scalp hunters .
in another picture , a solider is seen exposing himself while holding the skull in his other hand . " these pictures revolt and mystify me , " defense minister jung said .
" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .
germany is the second biggest contributor of peacekeepers to afghanistan with 2,750 troops and holds the command of isaf in the north .
the bundestag , or lower house of the german parliament , voted last month to extend their mandate in afghanistan until october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us pressures germany to send troops to southern afghanistan the us has urged germany to send troops from northern afghanistan to hot spots in the south , while taliban leader mullah omar released a video warning fighting will heat up even more .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2006 german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch , center , said rising right-wing violence in germany is disturbing the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era . " anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

-lrb- 25.10.2006 -rrb- german minister calls for homeland deployment of troops in a move likely to fuel controversy , german defense minister franz josef jung called tuesday for troops to be deployed on homeland anti-terror missions if necessary .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops . photographs purporting to show german soldiers desecrating a human skill in afghanistan , splashed on the front page of the country 's mass-selling bild newspaper on wednesday , provoked shock and disgust in germany .
" such behaviour is absolutely inexcusable , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead . " " runs counter to our values " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung in the published photos , the uniformed men are seen holding up the skull and posing with it on a jeep like scalp hunters .
in another picture , a solider is seen exposing himself while holding the skull in his other hand . " these pictures revolt and mystify me , " defense minister jung said .
" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.10.2006 german cabinet approves contentious health reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a political health care compromise was nearly as difficult as a triple bypass the german cabinet wednesday approved sweeping health care reforms that have threatened to split the country 's ruling grand coalition .
critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank .

" those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.10.2006 german cabinet approves contentious health reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a political health care compromise was nearly as difficult as a triple bypass the german cabinet wednesday approved sweeping health care reforms that have threatened to split the country 's ruling grand coalition .
critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- medical tourism growth industry in germany it might be the country 's own favorite bugbear , but german health care enjoys an excellent reputation abroad , both in terms of quality and cost .
medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it .
-lrb- 23.09.2006 -rrb- german health insurers tempt customers with incentives as germany wrestles over reforming its health care system , insurance providers aim to cut costs by encouraging their insured to lead healthy lifestyles .
not bad , many believe , but who pays for the incentives ? -lrb- 13.09.2006 -rrb- feedback should the coalition government have made other changes to germany 's health care system ?

knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops . photographs purporting to show german soldiers desecrating a human skill in afghanistan , splashed on the front page of the country 's mass-selling bild newspaper on wednesday , provoked shock and disgust in germany .
" such behaviour is absolutely inexcusable , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead . " " runs counter to our values " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung in the published photos , the uniformed men are seen holding up the skull and posing with it on a jeep like scalp hunters .
in another picture , a solider is seen exposing himself while holding the skull in his other hand . " these pictures revolt and mystify me , " defense minister jung said .
" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .

" the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .
it is necessary for the protection of the people .

" we regret if member states who have opened for the 10 are not going to open for romania and bulgaria , " said katharina von schnurbein , the eu executive 's spokeswoman for employment and social affairs . " the economic implications have been very positive in the first two years after the last enlargement , " she said .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .
the ministers are to hold a press conference and the home office website plans to publish the results of the talks . sarah ludford , a member of the european parliament and spokesperson on european justice for britain 's liberal democrat opposition party , fears however that a " cabal " of officials within the european union may be short-circuiting what she says is an already limited democratic process in forging eu security policy . " de facto , i think they are making decisions , " ludford said .
" it 's a short-hand way of arriving eventually at eu legislation . " a committee of the house of lords , the unelected upper chamber of the british parliament , called for less secrecy after the last g6 meeting in heiligendamm , germany , six months ago . a beneficial format bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 treaty of prum seeks to reinforce cross-border cooperation and sharing of information hugo brady , a research fellow with the british-based center for european reform , said the g6 format was beneficial because it was otherwise difficult to generate eu consensus . he said he was " not outraged " by the secrecy of the meetings . " governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation . " i know that great britain has the intention of joining and is kicking itself it was n't in the negotiations to start with , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister calls for homeland deployment of troops in a move likely to fuel controversy , german defense minister franz josef jung called tuesday for troops to be deployed on homeland anti-terror missions if necessary .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .

critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .

critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .

medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it .

not bad , many believe , but who pays for the incentives ? -lrb- 13.09.2006 -rrb- feedback should the coalition government have made other changes to germany 's health care system ?

it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .

the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .

" their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead .

" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .
germany is the second biggest contributor of peacekeepers to afghanistan with 2,750 troops and holds the command of isaf in the north .
the bundestag , or lower house of the german parliament , voted last month to extend their mandate in afghanistan until october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us pressures germany to send troops to southern afghanistan the us has urged germany to send troops from northern afghanistan to hot spots in the south , while taliban leader mullah omar released a video warning fighting will heat up even more .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .
-lrb- 23.12.2005 -rrb- european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .
the ministers are to hold a press conference and the home office website plans to publish the results of the talks . sarah ludford , a member of the european parliament and spokesperson on european justice for britain 's liberal democrat opposition party , fears however that a " cabal " of officials within the european union may be short-circuiting what she says is an already limited democratic process in forging eu security policy . " de facto , i think they are making decisions , " ludford said .
" it 's a short-hand way of arriving eventually at eu legislation . " a committee of the house of lords , the unelected upper chamber of the british parliament , called for less secrecy after the last g6 meeting in heiligendamm , germany , six months ago . a beneficial format bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 treaty of prum seeks to reinforce cross-border cooperation and sharing of information hugo brady , a research fellow with the british-based center for european reform , said the g6 format was beneficial because it was otherwise difficult to generate eu consensus . he said he was " not outraged " by the secrecy of the meetings . " governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation . " i know that great britain has the intention of joining and is kicking itself it was n't in the negotiations to start with , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister calls for homeland deployment of troops in a move likely to fuel controversy , german defense minister franz josef jung called tuesday for troops to be deployed on homeland anti-terror missions if necessary .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism .

" it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

not a goal to his name in three years .
but now that 's all changed , thanks to the intervention of the one and only david hasselhoff . he has professed to be more popular than elvis , the most searched-for star on the internet and the man that went unrecognized as the force that toppled the berlin wall and brought east and west germany back together .
now david hasselhoff has another claim to even more fame - and for once , he is n't the one making it . german soccer player moritz volz , currently playing for fulham in the english premier league , revealed this week that the us actor and singer has helped to end a goal drought that has stretched back three years . volz - one of the more down-to-earth foreign stars in the english game , who drives a beat-up old vw golf and lives in modest accommodation in one of london 's less salubrious neighborhoods - is a self-confessed devotee of the hoff and believes that his hero 's power was channeled through a new pair of boots he was wearing last weekend in the away game against aston villa in birmingham . aston villa 1 - hoff 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz volz finally scored with a little hoff power the fulham star , who loves to conform to german stereotypes by sometimes sporting a blonde mullet haircut and eating bratwurst , scored his first premiership goal to clinch a 1-1 draw for the west london club while shoed in a pair of cleats bearing the former baywatch actor 's name . " it was the first time i had worn my new boots with ' hoff 2 ' sewn on them , " volz told reporters .
" it 's hoff power . " hasselhoff claims a mind power technique he perfected to get the role as michael knight in cult 80 's series knight rider , the so-called " power of the subconscious mind " effect , is behind much of his success . fulham currently lie in eighth place in the english top flight , some nine points behind league leaders manchester united .
but given david hasselhoff 's record in changing world history , do n't be surprised if fulham harness his influence via volz 's boots and eclipse their neighbors chelsea come the end of the season to lift the championship trophy .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops . photographs purporting to show german soldiers desecrating a human skill in afghanistan , splashed on the front page of the country 's mass-selling bild newspaper on wednesday , provoked shock and disgust in germany .
" such behaviour is absolutely inexcusable , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .

" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .
germany is the second biggest contributor of peacekeepers to afghanistan with 2,750 troops and holds the command of isaf in the north .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops . photographs purporting to show german soldiers desecrating a human skill in afghanistan , splashed on the front page of the country 's mass-selling bild newspaper on wednesday , provoked shock and disgust in germany .
" such behaviour is absolutely inexcusable , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead . " " runs counter to our values " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung in the published photos , the uniformed men are seen holding up the skull and posing with it on a jeep like scalp hunters .
in another picture , a solider is seen exposing himself while holding the skull in his other hand . " these pictures revolt and mystify me , " defense minister jung said .
" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .
germany is the second biggest contributor of peacekeepers to afghanistan with 2,750 troops and holds the command of isaf in the north .
the bundestag , or lower house of the german parliament , voted last month to extend their mandate in afghanistan until october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us pressures germany to send troops to southern afghanistan the us has urged germany to send troops from northern afghanistan to hot spots in the south , while taliban leader mullah omar released a video warning fighting will heat up even more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2006 german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch , center , said rising right-wing violence in germany is disturbing the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era . " anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .

knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society .

they will also debate how to reduce the harm caused by organized crime , including value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- fraud and trafficking of drugs and people . european analyst hugo brady said vat fraud costs britain billions of pounds -lrb- dollars -rrb- a year alone . in its statement , the home office said the g6 ministers aim to " share ideas and best practice " in the areas of terrorism , immigration and crime rather than take concrete decisions . are they or are n't they ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : controling migration flow is one of the g6 priorities the g6 insist the meetings are transparent .

" de facto , i think they are making decisions , " ludford said .

" governments have been cooperating in europe on internal security since 1923 when interpol was founded and it 's always been secret , " brady said . brady expected the ministers to discuss expanding the small group of eu members that signed the treaty of prum in 2005 , which provided for sharing fingerprints , dna and bolstering police cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2006 german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch , center , said rising right-wing violence in germany is disturbing the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era . " anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .
" but when the police 's abilities are exhausted , such as in preventing attacks from the air , the bundeswehr has to be used .

not a goal to his name in three years .
but now that 's all changed , thanks to the intervention of the one and only david hasselhoff . he has professed to be more popular than elvis , the most searched-for star on the internet and the man that went unrecognized as the force that toppled the berlin wall and brought east and west germany back together .
now david hasselhoff has another claim to even more fame - and for once , he is n't the one making it . german soccer player moritz volz , currently playing for fulham in the english premier league , revealed this week that the us actor and singer has helped to end a goal drought that has stretched back three years . volz - one of the more down-to-earth foreign stars in the english game , who drives a beat-up old vw golf and lives in modest accommodation in one of london 's less salubrious neighborhoods - is a self-confessed devotee of the hoff and believes that his hero 's power was channeled through a new pair of boots he was wearing last weekend in the away game against aston villa in birmingham . aston villa 1 - hoff 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz volz finally scored with a little hoff power the fulham star , who loves to conform to german stereotypes by sometimes sporting a blonde mullet haircut and eating bratwurst , scored his first premiership goal to clinch a 1-1 draw for the west london club while shoed in a pair of cleats bearing the former baywatch actor 's name . " it was the first time i had worn my new boots with ' hoff 2 ' sewn on them , " volz told reporters .
" it 's hoff power . " hasselhoff claims a mind power technique he perfected to get the role as michael knight in cult 80 's series knight rider , the so-called " power of the subconscious mind " effect , is behind much of his success . fulham currently lie in eighth place in the english top flight , some nine points behind league leaders manchester united .
but given david hasselhoff 's record in changing world history , do n't be surprised if fulham harness his influence via volz 's boots and eclipse their neighbors chelsea come the end of the season to lift the championship trophy .

it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 25.10.2006 german cabinet approves contentious health reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a political health care compromise was nearly as difficult as a triple bypass the german cabinet wednesday approved sweeping health care reforms that have threatened to split the country 's ruling grand coalition .
critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .

critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .
the reform is seen as a test of chancellor angela merkel 's leadership and her government 's stability .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank .

" those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .

but in its december ruling , the karlsruhe-based federal court of justice overturned the verdict and said ackermann had failed to protect mannesmann shareholders . the federal court said the defendants should not have awarded the extra bonus payments because the men who received them were carrying out tasks in line with their normal duties . the bonus case triggered a major debate in germany about executive compensation and corporate greed with big payouts and salaries for top executives having been relatively unknown in the nation , unlike many anglo-saxon countries . an embarrassment for deutsche bank bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some investors are concerned about ackermann 's effect on deutsche bank 's image ackermann , who was a non-executive mannesmann board member when the bonuses were agreed to , did not receive any payout and denies any wrongdoing .
the case also involves mannesmann 's former supervisory chairman joachim funk , who received a 3-million-euro payout . the new trial , which is taking place in the same düsseldorf court where the original one was held , is expected to last until march 2007 .
it has raised questions about ackermann 's ability to lead deutsche bank . in the wake of the karlsruhe court decision , two of germany 's leading investor groups called on ackermann to stand aside , underscoring analysts ' concerns that the retrial could be deeply embarrassing for the bank . " so long the chief executive stays , the mannesmann case will be a deutsche bank case , " said reinhild keitel a spokesman for schutzgemeinschaft der kapitalanläer -lrb- sdk -rrb- . chief of controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has also boosted deutsche bank 's profits analysts had initially feared that if ackermann decided to stay on in his post while the new trial was underway it could open up a power vacuum at the frankfurt-based bank . the banker , who was forced to spend long hours in court during the previous sixth-month trial , has said he will continue to carry out his duties but indicated he could leave in the event of a guilty verdict . " those who know me also know that i do n't want money , if there is no performance , " ackermann said .
" naturally , i sent a letter to the governing body saying that should i step down on account of the mannesmann case , i shall receive not a single cent . " there is , however , no fear of ackermann going poor .
in 2004 alone , the swiss bank manager made 10.1 million euros .
and while ackermann is credited with boosting the bank 's earnings and stepping up the disposal of deutsche 's long-held stakes in other companies , the bank has also been hit by controversy .
his policy of closing less-profitable operations and building successful trading and investment banking franchises proved deeply unpopular domestically . plans for succession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankrupt media czar leo kirch is accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties deutsche bank had already began a succession plan drawn up by its chairman and ackermann supporter clemens börsig .
frontrunner for the top job is said to be anshu jain , co-head of the bank 's the london-based investment operations . other internal candidates in contention are rainer neske , head of the retail bank , and jain 's london associate michael cohrs . compounding deutsche bank 's woes is the prospect of another lengthy legal procedure , this time involving former media czar leo kirch , who blames the bank for the collapse of his empire in 2002 . last week , kirch filed legal papers accusing ackermann of breaching his fiduciary duties when he appointed börsig chairman and awarded him compensation for leaving his former job as the bank 's chief financial officer . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mannesmann retrial revives debate about business ethics a german federal court 's call for the deutsche bank boss ' retrial two days ago has reopened the debate about what kind of behavior germans should demand of their business leaders .
-lrb- 23.12.2005 -rrb- european papers divided over mannesmann ruling european editorialists sounded off thursday on the ramifications of germany 's highest court deciding the previous day to reopen the long-running mannesmann which could cost deutsche bank ceo ackermann his job .

critics say the changes will adversely affect patient care . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats spent months furiously debating the reforms that will affect almost all of germany 's 82 million people as the government overhauls public and private health care . " it is a good law and a big step forward for the german health system , " health minister ulla schmidt told reporters wednesday .
" this reform is not based on the lowest common denominator of a grand coalition .
rather , i would say that only in a grand coalition are such complex structural reforms possible . " she said the bill will have its first reading in parliament on friday and should become law by april 1 , 2007 . germany has world 's third largest health care bill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel watched her popularity drop as the health reform debate raged germany 's health costs are the world 's third highest behind the united states and switzerland , according to the organization for economic cooperation and development , and costs have increased by more than 50 percent over the past decade to about 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 31.5 billion -rrb- . the nation 's public health system , which consists of more than 250 medical funds and serves about 70 million germans , is frequently deep in the red .
more than 8 million people are covered by a parallel private healthcare system . key aspect of reform pushed back the centerpiece of the reform package is the introduction of a new overall health fund to collect and redistribute legally mandated health care contributions in a simpler and more transparent way . merkel announced earlier this month that the new fund would be delayed until jan.1 , 2009 , a year later than originally planned .
health reform was one of the main features of her government manifesto but the row it triggered highlighted rifts in the coalition and saw her party 's popularity hit a six-year low . critics fear drop in patient care bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands took to the streets to protest the reforms numerous critics have hit out against the reform , saying it does not make enough changes to a system in need of complete overhaul . " the reform does not provide a sustainable funding base for the health system , " jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of germany 's doctors ' association , told broadcaster zdf , adding that the reform would lead to a deterioration in care and fewer hospitals . several hundred german doctors protested the reform draft during marches in berlin on tuesday and more than 100,000 people took part in a nationwide protest against the reform program over the weekend . analysts said the health care system will not be able to cope with increased costs due to germany 's ageing population , high rate of unemployment and fewer people paying into the system . " this reform will simply lead the healthcare system into the cul-de-sac of centralized bureaucracy , " said germany 's doctors , dentists , hospitals and pharmacies in a joint statement . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government strikes deal on health system overhaul after extended bickering , germany 's coalition government has reached a compromise on reforming the health care system .

" anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

germany now fears reprisals against its troops . photographs purporting to show german soldiers desecrating a human skill in afghanistan , splashed on the front page of the country 's mass-selling bild newspaper on wednesday , provoked shock and disgust in germany .
" such behaviour is absolutely inexcusable , " chancellor angela merkel said .
" the government will investigate the soldiers involved and take rigorous measures against them , " merkel said .
meanwhile , politicans have voiced fears of retaliatory attacks by islamists against german peacekeepers in afghanistan .
" i hope that such incidents do n't happen again and the safety of our soldiers is not at risk , " german defense minister franz josef jung told german broadcaster ard .
the chairman of the german armed forces union , bernhard gertz said that there was a growing danger of attacks after the revelation of the shock photos .
" the commanders -lrb- in afghanistan -rrb- will have to consider what reactions they will have to deal with , " gertz said in a television interview .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was repulsed by the pictures the bild newspaper wrote that a member of the german armed forces claimed that the pictures showed german peacekeepers of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- unit near the capital kabul in early 2003 . " their irresponsible and inexcusable behaviour damages the reputation of the bundeswehr and our country , " said germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . the general inspector of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , said that one of the two soldiers who were brought in for questioning was still on active duty , while the other one is no longer in the army . according to a report in the mitteldeutsche zeitung , the two men belonged to the same mountain troops unit from the southern german state of bavaria .
the state prosecuter 's office in potsdam , outside berlin , confirmed that it had launched a criminal investigation into the affair on charges of " disturbing the peace of the dead . " " runs counter to our values " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister franz josef jung in the published photos , the uniformed men are seen holding up the skull and posing with it on a jeep like scalp hunters .
in another picture , a solider is seen exposing himself while holding the skull in his other hand . " these pictures revolt and mystify me , " defense minister jung said .
" it is clear that such behavior can not be tolerated from german soldiers .
it runs counter to the values and codes of conduct we try to instill in our soldiers .
people who behave like this have no place in the bundeswehr . " bild 's front page screamed : " shock photos of german soldiers " and inside " german soldiers desecrate a dead person . " the newspaper said it was unclear where the skull came from , or whether it belonged to an afghan or dated back to the soviet occupation in the 1980s .
it may also have been found in an alleged " mass grave , " the paper wrote . as yet , bild is the only confirmed source for the allegations . mandate extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf troops patroling roads near kabul the scandal broke just hours before the german cabinet decided to extend the mandate of its troops taking part in the us-led campaign against terrorism code-named " operation enduring freedom " by one year . the extension gives berlin the option of redeploying its ksk elite forces in afghanistan to help fight the resurgent taliban .
it also coincided with the release of the defence ministry 's first major policy manifesto since 1994 , which jung said paved the ground for germany 's readiness to take on more international peacekeeping missions .
germany is the second biggest contributor of peacekeepers to afghanistan with 2,750 troops and holds the command of isaf in the north .
the bundestag , or lower house of the german parliament , voted last month to extend their mandate in afghanistan until october 2007 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us pressures germany to send troops to southern afghanistan the us has urged germany to send troops from northern afghanistan to hot spots in the south , while taliban leader mullah omar released a video warning fighting will heat up even more .
-lrb- 24.10.2006 -rrb- germany approves afghanistan mandate despite concerns germany 's mission as part of the nato-led international force in afghanistan will be extended by a year after lawmakers approved a renewed application for the bundeswehr 's mandate .

not a goal to his name in three years .
but now that 's all changed , thanks to the intervention of the one and only david hasselhoff . he has professed to be more popular than elvis , the most searched-for star on the internet and the man that went unrecognized as the force that toppled the berlin wall and brought east and west germany back together .
now david hasselhoff has another claim to even more fame - and for once , he is n't the one making it . german soccer player moritz volz , currently playing for fulham in the english premier league , revealed this week that the us actor and singer has helped to end a goal drought that has stretched back three years . volz - one of the more down-to-earth foreign stars in the english game , who drives a beat-up old vw golf and lives in modest accommodation in one of london 's less salubrious neighborhoods - is a self-confessed devotee of the hoff and believes that his hero 's power was channeled through a new pair of boots he was wearing last weekend in the away game against aston villa in birmingham . aston villa 1 - hoff 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moritz volz finally scored with a little hoff power the fulham star , who loves to conform to german stereotypes by sometimes sporting a blonde mullet haircut and eating bratwurst , scored his first premiership goal to clinch a 1-1 draw for the west london club while shoed in a pair of cleats bearing the former baywatch actor 's name . " it was the first time i had worn my new boots with ' hoff 2 ' sewn on them , " volz told reporters .
" it 's hoff power . " hasselhoff claims a mind power technique he perfected to get the role as michael knight in cult 80 's series knight rider , the so-called " power of the subconscious mind " effect , is behind much of his success . fulham currently lie in eighth place in the english top flight , some nine points behind league leaders manchester united .
but given david hasselhoff 's record in changing world history , do n't be surprised if fulham harness his influence via volz 's boots and eclipse their neighbors chelsea come the end of the season to lift the championship trophy .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .

" i think the question of security for our country is so important that it is not a question of a single minister but a question for the entire government , " defense minister franz-josef jung said in berlin . the 133-page paper is the first to deal with german army engagements in 12 years and covers threats posed by terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction as well as future military deployments . military not only answer to world 's problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 9,000 bundeswehr soldiers are stationed around the world " today 's bundeswehr is shaped by international assignments , " the paper said , adding that germany will continue to deploy troops in the international fight against terrorism but also plans to play a role in resolving regional conflicts and ensuring the protection of human rights and free trade . " eighty percent of our trade occurs on the seas , which naturally includes the security of energy supplies and raw materials , " jung said .
" after an oil tanker was attacked by terrorists in the strait of hormuz in 2002 , it is clear that such terrorist activities need to be eliminated when it comes to the energy security and supplies and free trade on the seas . " the paper , however , also warned of placing too heavy an emphasis on military solution to international problems , saying that trade , diplomacy and developmental aid are of equal importance with martial force . germany currently has about 9,000 soldiers deployed in german missions around the world , a level the paper says could increase to a maximum of 14,000 troops in five theaters of operation . goals can not be geographically defined bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report moves away from defining germany 's interests geographically " german security policy has to take into account developments happening in regions that are geographically far away , " the paper said .
" interests can not be solely geographically defined in an age of globalization . " the report also went to lengths to define germany 's national interests , which nearly always coincide with those of the european union , according to social democratic party defense expert jörn theißen . " i would suggest a discussion about our european goals , what can actually still be a german goal and what is only possible in an international framework , " he said . continued close relations with nato also " remain the basis for germany and europe 's shared security , " according to the paper , which also calls the united states a close ally of " paramount importance " to germany . critics hoped for more pubic discussion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers have become a common sight in protecting against natural disasters theißen , however , criticized the paper for not doing enough to provoke a wide enough debate in germany on security issues and their impact on legal and diplomatic efforts . " the white paper was supposed to start a wide discussion but was prepared by a small circle of people and then was stopped by the justice and foreign ministers , " theißen said . political differences of opinion in chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition of conservative christians and social democrats on deploying the bundeswehr domestically stopped the discussion before it reached the spd-run justice and foreign ministries , theißen added . defense minister jung , however , again said the government needs the ability to use bundeswehr inside of germany , which is currently unconstitutional . " none of us wants police work to be taken over , domestic security will continue to be provided by the police in the future , " jung told german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.10.2006 german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch , center , said rising right-wing violence in germany is disturbing the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era . " anti-semitic and far-right attacks have become so blatant and aggressive that it brings to mind the years after 1933 " when adolf hitler come to power , charlotte knobloch told a conference on right-wing extremism in berlin on tuesday .
knobloch , a holocaust survivor , said authorities appeared " at a loss " to cope with the increasing popularity of neo-nazi parties that have gained a following among the poor in the former communist east of the country .
she urged police and the courts to take a " hard line " towards extremists , whose message , she said , has " become firmly entrenched in certain spheres of our society . " together with uwe-karsten heye , a former government spokesman and chairman of the anti-racism organization called " show your color " who raised a stir ahead of the world cup by talking of " no-go areas " for foreigners , knobloch said what was needed was a " democracy summit " to thrash out further measures to deal with the growing problem of right-wing extremism . increase in right-wing crimes germany has in the past two years seen right-wing crimes increase steadily and support grow for neo-nazi parties as they successfully exploited unhappiness with high unemployment and hostility towards foreigners . new figures compiled by the interior ministry show a 20 percent increase in racial crimes committed by the far-right .
the results of the research come less than a month after the far-right national democratic party posted strong results in regional elections . the extremist npd won enough seats in last month 's elections to gain admission to the regional assembly in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
it is the second eastern german state where the party is represented .
the other is saxony . statistics published last week showed that there were more 8,000 crimes linked to the far-right reported from january to the end of august 2006 , an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period in 2005 . israel 's ambassador to germany , shimon stein , said this was proof that these rightist parties can no longer be considered marginal .
in a newspaper interview published over the weekend , stein said he was concerned that jews do not feel safe in germany . uwe-karsten heye said the time has come to think about finally implementing a national action plan against right extremism . however , that comes with a price .
" whoever takes the integration of foreign teenagers seriously and wants to stop the rising number of young men joining far-right groups has to invest heavily in kindergartens , schools and social work , " he said . knobloch welcomed the fact that the german government had decided to raise funds earmarked to fight right-wing extremism . " i believe , now that we have the financial means , through the government funding made available - which comes to about five-million euros - that we are on the right path , " she said . bildunterschrift : others are " against neo-nazis , " as this t-shirt says " but this money has to be invested in the right places and it ’ s important that the organizations with experience are supported , " she added . teens talk to teens however , getting the message across is the main challenge for organizations trying to fight racism and right-wing crime , uwe-karsten heye pointed out . " it 's not easy to convince a stubborn 14-year-old with strong neo-nazi beliefs , " he said .
" and then wonder : how did this happen ?
this kid wasn ’ t born this way . " actually , it is a challenge for any parent or adult to get such a message across to a 14-year-old .
one organization that tries to fight right-wing crime is the anne frank center in berlin .
it creates exhibitions which travel from town to town - in an attempt to educate teenagers about the dangers of far-right groups .
the center trains teenagers from the communities in which the exhibitions are being shown to work as guides . " the idea behind this concept is that teenagers are more interested in a subject if the teacher is also a teenager , ” said hans-peter gahleitner , an 18-year-old who works for the anne frank center . " more opportunities are needed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " neo-nazis appeal to the young because they have nothing else " gahleitner has a theory about why far-right crimes and support for neo-nazism are on the rise . " there are sometimes opportunities offered only by these right-wing parties , " he said .
" there are no other possibilities and other initiatives for the young generation . " uwe-karsten heye agrees that the mainstream parties need to involve younger people more . " we need a long-term strategy to win back these regions that we 've lost , " he said .
" it 's not that we ca n't muster up any support there because we 're idiots .
it ’ s because we 're not represented well enough in these areas . " " we as democrats have no presence there , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an exhibition on anne frank traveled through germany a while ago others stress that the tendency to look away has increased .
in addition , many people in the eastern states have tended not to even talk about neo-nazism and related topics since the fall of the berlin wall .
often , the attitude is : it 's better not to say anything at all , than to say something wrong .

crews working in the rhondda cynon taf area had the worst number of attacks in the last year with 40 incidents .
newport came second with 34 incidents of physical and verbal abuse .
a spokesman for the welsh ambulance trust said the problem of violence against its staff was of " great concern " .
in its annual statement , the trust revealed that during 2005-2006 , there were a total of 290 incidents of physical and verbal aggression by the public to its crews .
out of that figure , 123 incidents resulted in injury to the crew member .
the trust has said it has put in place a training system for its staff to deal with the threat of violence against them and says it operates a " zero tolerance policy towards such incidents " .
paramedics have said that the level of threat against them has led to a situation where one of the crew acts as a look-out while the other attends the patient .
gino matrella , a paramedic working in newport , said the levels of threat against staff had increased in recent years .
" we have always had violence but never to this scale , " he said .
" i 've been a paramedic for 20 years and the violence seems to be a much more regular thing .
" it 's very demoralising .
you turn up at an incident to help someone and you do n't know if you are going into situation where you are going to get assaulted .
" it 's got to the point now with rapid response and triage vehicles where we have to make sure there is someone else in the vehicle in case they get attacked .
" i 've had bottles and glasses thrown at the ambulance .
" the whole situation has become very emotive and you find yourself asking what are we doing this for .
" just because we are in a uniform does n't mean we have any authority , we are neutral and treat everyone the same , " he added .
training policy a spokesman for the trust said : " incidents of violence and abuse on ambulance staff are a matter of great concern for the trust .
" we have a zero tolerance policy towards such incidents , whether the violence and abuse is physical or verbal and all our staff are now equipped and trained to cope with conflict and in dealing with members of the public under stressful circumstances .
" the ambulance services nhs trust believes that any attack , whether physical or verbal is unacceptable .
" unfortunately , they do happen to our crews and to members of all the other emergency services and are an added burden which emergency service personnel can do without as they go about their job of helping the public . "
he added that crews underwent conflict training to recognise how to deal with potentially difficult situations .

net profits for the three months to 30 september hit 128 billion yen -lrb- $ 1.1bn ; £ 600m -rrb- , down from 134 billion yen a year earlier .
the fall was mainly due to the 50 billion yen honda lost hedging against changes in the value of the yen .
japan 's third-biggest carmaker relies heavily on exports and its profits can be hit by big currency fluctuations .
honda 's operating profit for the quarter rose nearly 19 % , thanks to a 9.5 % rise in overseas sales and the falling value of the yen against the us dollar , which makes its exports more valuable .
the company 's range of fuel-efficient cars is helping it to win customers in europe and the us , which it relies on for most of its profits .
expansion plan however , the company said car sales in japan had fallen 6.6 % .
honda said it now expected its global car sales for the 2006/07 business year to reach 3.7 million , slightly less than the 3.72 million it forecast in april .
in may , the car giant unveiled sweeping expansion plans for new plants in japan and north america .
the tokyo-based group plans to pump more than $ 1.2bn -lrb- £ 634m -rrb- into two new factories in japan , one in the us and an engine plant in canada .
it said the new plants would help honda 's plans to accelerate sales by 34 % by 2010 .

net profits for the three months to 30 september hit 128 billion yen -lrb- $ 1.1bn ; £ 600m -rrb- , down from 134 billion yen a year earlier .

they say 119 new cases have been reported in the past month , taking the total number of infections to 416 .
the disease , which attacks children under five years , affects the nervous system and can result in paralysis .
with almost one-third of the total 1,449 cases in the world , india is seen as a big stumbling block in the struggle against polio .
particularly dismal has been the case of the northern state of uttar pradesh where 358 polio cases have been recorded .
spreading virus earlier it was believed that the virus was confined to some pockets of western uttar pradesh , but health ministry officials say now it has spread to 41 of the 70 districts in the state .
the neighbouring state of bihar comes second with 28 infections .
with new cases being reported from the capital , delhi , and in the western city of mumbai , experts say the virus has now travelled out of the region and is afflicting children in the whole of northern and western india .
officials blame it on people moving out of the worst-affected states to other parts of the country .
" it is the migrants who have taken it out of bihar and uttar pradesh .
all the cases found in delhi or mumbai can be linked to the state as these children had travelled there in the last few months , " a spokesman for the health ministry told the bbc .
experts say the spread of the virus is dependent on three factors - lack of nutrition , environmental causes and poor hygiene and sanitation .
concerned they say almost all the cases have been reported from areas where sanitation is an issue and most of the children belong to poor families unable to give them a nutritious diet .
in the developed countries , a child needs three doses for immunisation .
but in india , a child may need up to 10 doses , they say .
officials have confirmed that one child in delhi has contracted the virus despite being given nine shots of the vaccine .
" we 're still in the process of examining how that happened , but she may have had diarrhoea at the time she was given the vaccine .
in such a situation , her body will expel the medicine and it will not have the desired affect , " says the health ministry spokesman .
last month , india 's health minister held an emergency meeting of officials from the states affected by the disease .
last year , only 66 cases of polio were recorded in india and officials say the current numbers are giving them sleepless nights .
a huge pulse polio campaign is being launched in november and officials say they hope the virus will be contained soon .
although polio has no cure , it is easily preventable through vaccine .
before 1988 , when the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- launched a global anti-polio campaign , there were more than 350,000 cases worldwide .
today the disease has been eradicated in much of the world but is still found in some countries .
a strain of the disease , which originated in uttar pradesh state , has also travelled to the neighbouring countries of nepal and bangladesh .
it has also infected people in faraway african countries like angola , namibia and congo .
india 's failure to contain the virus has caused serious concern to the world health organisation in geneva .
it has written to india 's health minister , seeking a meeting with him .

the disease , which attacks children under five years , affects the nervous system and can result in paralysis .

the news pleased investors and sent amazon 's shares 14 % higher in after-hours electronic trading .
however , analysts were still concerned about the company 's profit margins .
" while the growth rates for the company are impressive , they seem to have to keep working harder and harder to get that growth , " said steve weinstein , an analyst with pacific crest .
