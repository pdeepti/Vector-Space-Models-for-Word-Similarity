" the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .

they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .
but they can easily reach the heinersdorf location , which is why the community chose it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .

but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .

people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .

some groups say no . in the town of friedrichshafen on lake constance , preparations are in full swing for the world cup , which kicks off in june .
the iranian national soccer squad will be quartered at one of the region 's exclusive hotels and should iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad come to germany to visit his country 's players , he would be welcome - here in friedrichshafen , at least . " the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .
in one scenario , ahmadinejad could watch the iranian team play in nuremberg , a city with a notorious nazi past . " he is n't welcome here , " said stephan j. kramer of the central council of jews in germany .
" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup 2006 logo germany is now facing a delicate diplomatic situation and the government is trying to keep the political concerns separate from the sporting ones . " -lsb- the interior minister -rsb- wanted to make clear the world cup in germany is a sporting event first and foremost , an event to be celebrated by the world 's nations , " thomas steg , a deputy government spokesman .
" we should try to resist all attempts to exploit this event for political purposes . " ahmadinejad presents himself in public as a soccer fan and some worry that he might use the world cup as a platform to promote tehran 's agenda .
but sebastian edathy , a social-democratic member of parliament , says despite the fact that the iranian president is an unsympathetic figure for many , he has done nothing that would push germany toward denying him entry into the country . " he 's a very unpleasant character , but he has not been convicted by international institutions or courts as a war criminal , " he said .
" he can come .
even if we do n't want to see him here and would prefer that he stay at home . " lukashenko not wanted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko in contrast , the president of belarus , alexander lukashenko. will not be able to travel to germany .
the european union has banned him from entering the 25-nation bloc because the eu believes he rigged his country 's presidential election last month . the eu is now exploring the possibility of imposing a travel ban on ahmadinejad because of his statements about the holocaust . beate rudolf , an expert in international law in berlin , said that - even as things stand now - germany is n't legally obliged to allow unwelcome guests into the country . " germany is not obliged to give reasons for granting or refusing to grant him permission to enter the country , " she said .
" the justifications behind a possible ban do not have to be made public .
berlin is n't obliged to soccer 's top body fifa to allow heads of state to enter the country .
germany is free to decide . " disproportionate response ? if ahmadinejad does visit germany , iranian exiles and human rights groups are expected to stage large protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2006 europe argues about who gets to monitor human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eu countries are members in the council of europe among the european union 's numerous institutions is a racism and xenophobia monitoring center .
now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .

some groups say no . in the town of friedrichshafen on lake constance , preparations are in full swing for the world cup , which kicks off in june .
the iranian national soccer squad will be quartered at one of the region 's exclusive hotels and should iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad come to germany to visit his country 's players , he would be welcome - here in friedrichshafen , at least . " the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .
in one scenario , ahmadinejad could watch the iranian team play in nuremberg , a city with a notorious nazi past . " he is n't welcome here , " said stephan j. kramer of the central council of jews in germany .
" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup 2006 logo germany is now facing a delicate diplomatic situation and the government is trying to keep the political concerns separate from the sporting ones . " -lsb- the interior minister -rsb- wanted to make clear the world cup in germany is a sporting event first and foremost , an event to be celebrated by the world 's nations , " thomas steg , a deputy government spokesman .
" we should try to resist all attempts to exploit this event for political purposes . " ahmadinejad presents himself in public as a soccer fan and some worry that he might use the world cup as a platform to promote tehran 's agenda .
but sebastian edathy , a social-democratic member of parliament , says despite the fact that the iranian president is an unsympathetic figure for many , he has done nothing that would push germany toward denying him entry into the country . " he 's a very unpleasant character , but he has not been convicted by international institutions or courts as a war criminal , " he said .
" he can come .
even if we do n't want to see him here and would prefer that he stay at home . " lukashenko not wanted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko in contrast , the president of belarus , alexander lukashenko. will not be able to travel to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2006 europe argues about who gets to monitor human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eu countries are members in the council of europe among the european union 's numerous institutions is a racism and xenophobia monitoring center .
now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .
a european union human rights agency would just add to the confusion , they said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the protection of human rights is endangered " thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2006 europe argues about who gets to monitor human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eu countries are members in the council of europe among the european union 's numerous institutions is a racism and xenophobia monitoring center .
now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .
a european union human rights agency would just add to the confusion , they said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the protection of human rights is endangered " thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights .
-lrb- april 8 , 2006 -rrb- european rights watchdog urges legislation to control spies europe 's leading human rights watchdog , the council of europe , said on wednesday that the continent is a " happy hunting ground " for foreign secret services .
the body called for new laws to control spies .
-lrb- march 1 , 2006 -rrb- germany aims for seat on new un human rights council on may 9 , the united nations general assembly will decide which countries will share the 47 seats of the newly created un human rights council .

they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .
but they can easily reach the heinersdorf location , which is why the community chose it .
it wants to stick to its plans in heinsersdorf , despite the opposition . the conflict has had one positive effect .

they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .
but they can easily reach the heinersdorf location , which is why the community chose it .
it wants to stick to its plans in heinsersdorf , despite the opposition . the conflict has had one positive effect .
many residents have been learning much more about islam in the past weeks , which might be a first step towards mutual understanding . markus rimmele -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatun sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.04.2006 debate over possible world cup visit by iranian leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in germany would like a travel ban be placed on iran 's president the fact that iran 's soccer team is coming to germany to compete in the world cup has sparked debate over whether that country 's controversial president should be allowed into germany .
some groups say no . in the town of friedrichshafen on lake constance , preparations are in full swing for the world cup , which kicks off in june .
the iranian national soccer squad will be quartered at one of the region 's exclusive hotels and should iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad come to germany to visit his country 's players , he would be welcome - here in friedrichshafen , at least . " the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .
in one scenario , ahmadinejad could watch the iranian team play in nuremberg , a city with a notorious nazi past . " he is n't welcome here , " said stephan j. kramer of the central council of jews in germany .
" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup 2006 logo germany is now facing a delicate diplomatic situation and the government is trying to keep the political concerns separate from the sporting ones . " -lsb- the interior minister -rsb- wanted to make clear the world cup in germany is a sporting event first and foremost , an event to be celebrated by the world 's nations , " thomas steg , a deputy government spokesman .
" we should try to resist all attempts to exploit this event for political purposes . " ahmadinejad presents himself in public as a soccer fan and some worry that he might use the world cup as a platform to promote tehran 's agenda .
but sebastian edathy , a social-democratic member of parliament , says despite the fact that the iranian president is an unsympathetic figure for many , he has done nothing that would push germany toward denying him entry into the country . " he 's a very unpleasant character , but he has not been convicted by international institutions or courts as a war criminal , " he said .
" he can come .
even if we do n't want to see him here and would prefer that he stay at home . " lukashenko not wanted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko in contrast , the president of belarus , alexander lukashenko. will not be able to travel to germany .
the european union has banned him from entering the 25-nation bloc because the eu believes he rigged his country 's presidential election last month . the eu is now exploring the possibility of imposing a travel ban on ahmadinejad because of his statements about the holocaust . beate rudolf , an expert in international law in berlin , said that - even as things stand now - germany is n't legally obliged to allow unwelcome guests into the country . " germany is not obliged to give reasons for granting or refusing to grant him permission to enter the country , " she said .
" the justifications behind a possible ban do not have to be made public .
berlin is n't obliged to soccer 's top body fifa to allow heads of state to enter the country .
germany is free to decide . " disproportionate response ? if ahmadinejad does visit germany , iranian exiles and human rights groups are expected to stage large protests .
neo-nazis could exploit the opportunity to stage demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian team will be staying in friedrichshafen 's krone hotel during the world cup the police are prepared for all eventualities and are keeping a close eye on the iranian squad 's world cup quarters in friedrichshafen . while many are hoping the iranian president will simply decide to stay away , including parliamentarian edathy , fewer seem willing to advocate an outright ban . " as long as mr ahmadinejad just talks rather than acts , i think there 's no way of imposing an entry ban , " he said .
" i would find that disproportionate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .

people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .

he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2006 europe argues about who gets to monitor human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eu countries are members in the council of europe among the european union 's numerous institutions is a racism and xenophobia monitoring center .
now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .
a european union human rights agency would just add to the confusion , they said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the protection of human rights is endangered " thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2006 east berliners oppose mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin is the largest in germany germans in a small east berlin neighborhood are protesting plans to build a mosque there .
they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .
but they can easily reach the heinersdorf location , which is why the community chose it .
it wants to stick to its plans in heinsersdorf , despite the opposition . the conflict has had one positive effect .

they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .

" in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .

nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .

in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ?

these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2006 europe argues about who gets to monitor human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all eu countries are members in the council of europe among the european union 's numerous institutions is a racism and xenophobia monitoring center .
now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .
a european union human rights agency would just add to the confusion , they said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the protection of human rights is endangered " thomas hammarberg has taken over as the council of europe 's chief human rights envoy .
in an interview with dw-world , he warns of the fight against terror 's threat to human rights .

but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .

but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .

people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .

he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .

some groups say no . in the town of friedrichshafen on lake constance , preparations are in full swing for the world cup , which kicks off in june .
the iranian national soccer squad will be quartered at one of the region 's exclusive hotels and should iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad come to germany to visit his country 's players , he would be welcome - here in friedrichshafen , at least . " the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .
in one scenario , ahmadinejad could watch the iranian team play in nuremberg , a city with a notorious nazi past . " he is n't welcome here , " said stephan j. kramer of the central council of jews in germany .
" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .

" we should try to resist all attempts to exploit this event for political purposes . " ahmadinejad presents himself in public as a soccer fan and some worry that he might use the world cup as a platform to promote tehran 's agenda .
but sebastian edathy , a social-democratic member of parliament , says despite the fact that the iranian president is an unsympathetic figure for many , he has done nothing that would push germany toward denying him entry into the country . " he 's a very unpleasant character , but he has not been convicted by international institutions or courts as a war criminal , " he said .
" he can come .

the european union has banned him from entering the 25-nation bloc because the eu believes he rigged his country 's presidential election last month . the eu is now exploring the possibility of imposing a travel ban on ahmadinejad because of his statements about the holocaust . beate rudolf , an expert in international law in berlin , said that - even as things stand now - germany is n't legally obliged to allow unwelcome guests into the country . " germany is not obliged to give reasons for granting or refusing to grant him permission to enter the country , " she said .
" the justifications behind a possible ban do not have to be made public .

some groups say no . in the town of friedrichshafen on lake constance , preparations are in full swing for the world cup , which kicks off in june .
the iranian national soccer squad will be quartered at one of the region 's exclusive hotels and should iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad come to germany to visit his country 's players , he would be welcome - here in friedrichshafen , at least . " the town 's mayor , herr büchelmaier , has signalled that he would receive him in friedrichshafen if he decided to come , " said city official peter hauswald , saying current political issues would not be a topic of discussion . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble weighed in early on this subject , saying the iranian president was welcome to come to the world cup , like any other head of state , since germany wanted to be a good host .
but ahmadinejad 's controversial statements on sensitive issues , such as his denial of the holocaust and repeated threats against israel , have many of his critics saying a visit by him to germany would be inappropriate .
in one scenario , ahmadinejad could watch the iranian team play in nuremberg , a city with a notorious nazi past . " he is n't welcome here , " said stephan j. kramer of the central council of jews in germany .
" at least , as long as he does n't retract his comments , or at least qualify them . "
he added that his organization is puzzled at the interior minister 's statements that ahmadinejad is welcome . sports , not politics besides the controversy over the iranian president 's anti-israel comments , there are tensions over tehran 's controversial nuclear program and its refusal to halt its uranium enrichment program , which western powers , and particularly the us , fear will be used to develop nuclear weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup 2006 logo germany is now facing a delicate diplomatic situation and the government is trying to keep the political concerns separate from the sporting ones . " -lsb- the interior minister -rsb- wanted to make clear the world cup in germany is a sporting event first and foremost , an event to be celebrated by the world 's nations , " thomas steg , a deputy government spokesman .

nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .

india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .

but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2006 east berliners oppose mosque großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in west berlin is the largest in germany germans in a small east berlin neighborhood are protesting plans to build a mosque there .
they 'd prefer their small garden plots to a minaret on the skyline . mosques are by no means a new development in germany .
as far back as the 16th century , prussian king frederick william i had the first mosque built in potsdam for his turkish soldiers . in berlin , the first mosque was constructed in 1924 . now there are some 30 muslim places of worship in the german capital .
but most of them are in neukölln and kreuzberg , in the western part of the city .
these are the neighborhoods in which the erstwhile guest workers of the 1960s and 1970s lived . in the former communist and , at the time , internationally insular east berlin , there are no mosques .
but the muslim ahmadiyya community would now like to build prayer rooms with a minaret in heinersdorf , in the pankow district . residents ' fears are unfounded the ahmadiyya community is a small minority in islam .
its members are often considered nonconformists and are even persecuted in countries such as pakistan .
in east berlin , the group is also meeting with opposition , although most people there do n't even know the difference between ahmadiyya , sunnite or shiite muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in berlin 's ahmadiyya community get religious instruction the ahmadiyya community claims to have some 200 members in berlin .
they present themselves as relatively liberal and clearly distinguish themselves from any form of fundamentalism . " love for all , hate for no one " a sign behind the imam 's desk reads .
abdul basit tariq says he does n't understand the opposition in heinersdorf . " these are unfounded fears , " imam tariq says .
" people listen to the news , see scenes on television and that 's why they 're scared of muslims .
they think muslims are terrorists and suicide bombers .
their heads are full of these things . " politicians have decided over residents ' heads karin reinke , deputy of the local citizen 's interest group fighting the mosque plans , says the neighborhood feels it should have been asked . " in my opinion , if someone wants to be your neighbor , they come by , look at a property and then say ' hello , i want to be your neighbor ' , " reinke says .
" but we feel that the whole thing was dealt with over our heads , together with the politicians . " according to reinke , this was currently " an explosive topic " and all citizens should be included in the decision process . " i ask myself whether our representatives in the town hall , which we ourselves elected , are authorized to simply impose this on us ? " she says . a complicated battle heinersdorf is by no means an idyllic spot .
it 's a six-lane feeder road with a gas station , fast-food restaurants and a used-car dealer .
behind these are single-family houses and small garden plots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim integration is currently high on the agenda in germany the mosque is planned as a two-story building with a cupola and a small minaret .
the plans have caused quite a stir . an open council , which was intended to inform residents , had to be broken up .
the right-wing extremist party npd jumped on the bandwagon and organized a demonstration against the mosque , which in turn sparked a counterdemonstration . the heinersdorf residents do n't know anymore who they should fight first : the district politicians from pankow , which authorized the mosque in the first place ?
the right-wing extremists they 're being lumped together with ?
or the ahmadiyya community behind the project ? it seems to be just too much for some residents since a mosque in heinersdorf is foreign to their world view . " when i read in all papers from monday to friday what sorts of consequences failed multiculturalism and failed integration programs have in this city , i 'm worried , " says resident jürgen kubisch .
" the same thing when i hear how the shiites and sunnites are massacring each other in iraq . " fostering understanding for islam the ahmadiyya community says it is coming in good faith and the mosque will be open to all visitors .
according to imam tariq , the group does not want to recruit new followers , as many residents fear . none of the community even wants to live in the neighborhood .
most reside in western berlin , in the wedding district .
but they can easily reach the heinersdorf location , which is why the community chose it .
it wants to stick to its plans in heinsersdorf , despite the opposition . the conflict has had one positive effect .
many residents have been learning much more about islam in the past weeks , which might be a first step towards mutual understanding . markus rimmele -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de integration debate rages in wake of honor killing conviction the so-called honor killing of 23-year-old hatun sürücü by her brother ayhan and his subsequent trial and conviction have plunged germany further into a volatile debate regarding the integration of muslim immigrants .

now the vienna-based body is set to be turned into a human rights agency , a move that is generating controversy . thomas hammarberg is not easily ruffled .
a veteran of humanitarian missions in various parts of the globe , he 's no stranger to stress or testy verbal exchanges .
but since he took over as human rights commissioner for the intergovernmental council of europe -lrb- coe -rrb- a few weeks ago , he has frequently found himself agitated .
he has put the blame on the european commission , which aims to set up a human rights agency in vienna .
hammarberg does n't see the point . " the european union is beginning to be interested in human rights , " hammarberg said .
" they should not do that in a way that it undermines the work of the council of europe , because that would be duplication and create an uncertainty about what are actually the standards that we have agreed on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarberg recently became the coe 's top human rights envoy but the european commission has countered that the new agency would not be a rival in the struggle to promote human rights and democracy .
" it is not a problem if the european commission and the council of europe occasionally say the same things , " said commission president jose manuel barroso .
" on the contrary , the two augment and complement one another . "
wasting taxpayers ' money ?
however , it 's not that simple .
the protection of human rights and democracy is the coe 's core task .
its 46 member countries have all signed its convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
thus , citizens of those countries who believe their basic rights have been violated can submit their cases to the european court of human rights if they 've already exhausted all national means of legal redress . " the important thing with the council of europe is that the court for human rights is within the council of europe , " said hammarberg .
" and the judges there are the ones who are experts in interpreting the real meaning of the convention , and that should be respected . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights -lrb- photo -rrb- and the coe are located in strasbourg , france hammarberg is n't convinced europe should have a second human rights institution that would possibly compete with the first .
the european commission has said it 's necessary to ensure that human rights clauses in eu treaties are adhered to . however , at the council of europe , people suspect that taxpayers ' money is being squandered , and that ordinary citizens will be bewildered by the creation of yet another eu institution . coe spokesmen have said their organization already suffers from the public often mistaking it for other eu bodies , such as the european council and the european parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .
the visit of french president jacques chirac could help change that as it brings india a step closer to its goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.04.2006 at hanover fair , ' new india ' takes spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hanover fair revolves around industrial technology india will become the official partner country of germany 's giant hanover trade fair , providing a platform for increasingly confident indian firms to size up the german market . trade fairs in germany are usually all about business .
but attendees can expect a heavy dose of pleasure when india becomes the official partner country of the hanover industrial fair on april 24 after a gap of 21 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is cashing in on the popularity of its fashion and food scene this time , in addition to sending the usual big-business delegations , india 's marketing gurus are rolling out a lavish blitz to woo the hosts at the opening ceremony on april 23 .
a bevy of models will flaunt designer indian silks , a team of star chefs is set to ensure the best in indian curries , and a dance troupe will round out the colorful events aiming to reflect india ’ s current upbeat mood . “ this year india has been very active in promoting its brand and image internationally and hanover is one of the highlights .
people need to see the new india , " said nandan nilekani , head of indian it giant infosys .
nilekani fronted a similar charm offensive at the world economic forum in davos earlier this year . the hoopla is likely to add color to a normally staid german business event , but it won ’ t deflect attention from the real issue at hanover : how to expand existing trade and business links between delhi and berlin .
to date those ties are doing well , but they could be better , participants say . it ’ s a familiar theme and one that is faithfully repeated at each indo-german business meeting .
in hanover , a 300-strong delegation led by indian prime minister manmohan singh will discuss it for the first time with the new chancellor angela merkel . modest success ever since india took the road to economic liberalization in 1991 , germany has taken a keen interest in the country ’ s progress , using fairs and business events to seal deals and translate it into actual investments , particularly in the field of heavy machinery and chemicals . bilateral trade has enjoyed a steady upturn over the past years , growing to a record 6.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- in 2004 - an increase of 22.5 percent from the previous year .
the upward trend has continued in 2005 . this year , small- and midsize firms will be in the spotlight , according to kamal nath , india 's minister for trade and commerce . " we are encouraging our small-scale enterprises to visit the hanover fair so that they can upgrade their technology because i believe that in germany a lot of technology and innovation is in the hands of midsized firms , " nath told journalists in delhi last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian prime minister manmohan singh -lrb- center -rrb- with kamal nath -lrb- right -rrb- in addition to machinery and chemicals , germany has gained a foothold in several other sectors of india ’ s fast growing economy .
engineering giant siemens , it major sap , deutsche bank , mercedes and logistics heavyweight dhl are all well known brands in india today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german logistics giant dhl dominates the indian market india and germany also share cultural contacts , dating back to an exchange of linguistic scholars , philosophers and hinduism researchers over four centuries . this means germans are popular in india , said bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai -lrb- igcc -rrb- . “ india is the only country in the world where the goethe institut , germany ’ s official language and culture institution , is called max müller bhavan -lrb- named after a renowned indologist -rrb- , ” said steinrücke .
he added that the igcc has its hands full with the arrival of a new german company in india almost every week . the bad news despite all the positives , however , experts point out that given india ’ s economic attractions - growth rates of around 7 percent , booming stock market , and a growing middle class estimated at 350 million people - germany has proved too slow to make a major entry into the indian market . according to the igcc , germany ’ s annual trade with india is still only as big as its trade volume with luxembourg or belgium in a single month , amounting to a mere 0.47 percent of germany ’ s total trade .
india thus ranks a lowly 34 on the list of germany ’ s trading partners .
a study by deutsche bank points out that german direct investment in india between 1985 and 2004 was a mere $ 1.5 billion , less than what germany had invested in the same period in south korea and singapore . seeking german investment in energy montek singh ahluwalia , deputy head of the indian state planning commission and a close advisor to prime minister singh , said the key is to lure mid-sized german firms to india . " it ’ s a matter of regret that we haven ’ t been able to build interests and bridges there as much we should have done , ” ahluwalia told journalists recently .
“ i hope more of that will happen after the prime minister ’ s visit to hanover . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fraport has already won a bid to modernize the delhi airport when asked why they are hesitant to invest in india , german companies often cite reasons like shoddy infrastructure , excessive red tape , and power shortages .
so at hanover , india plans to bang the drum for german investment in exactly those problem areas : infrastructure and energy . the latter is set to be a major issue , with talk of an indo-german energy dialogue as india looks to deregulate electricity generation and distribution in order to meet growing demand . india investing in germany ? finally , the hanover fair won ’ t just be a question of what the germans can do for india , but also the other way round .
an increasing number of indian firms - auto-component exporter bharat forge , conglomerate reliance and pharmaceutical company dr reddy 's among others - have been buying up operations in germany in recent years and are eyeing further acquisitions . “ indian firms are increasingly flexing their muscle and going out and facing the world market , ” said steinrücke .
“ hopefully , they ’ ll invest more in germany after hanover . ” sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de india hopes to boost nuclear program with french aid within the international community india is hardly recognized as a nuclear power .

cracks have appeared for a second time in the oak desks used by ams in the debating chamber .
last month , the building 's roof sprung a leak .
tory william graham said ams were told the desk faults had been fixed , so the new problems should not have happened .
the assembly government said they were " minor defects " which would be mended .
the desktop flaws - described by mr graham as " dramatic " - have appeared in a number of work stations used by ams .
similar cracks have appeared in woodwork in the public gallery of the cardiff bay building , which was opened by the queen on st david 's day , 1 march .
you could build an unadventurous , cavity-wall building , totally unexciting and lacking in innovation ... but it would be so dead boring that architecture would never move on maureen kelly owen , royal society of architects in wales within days of its state opening , the landmark building , designed by lord richard rogers , had to undergo repairs after the roof began leaking in heavy rain .
the problem with the desks is the second for contractors .
the assembly 's plenary session was delayed in january after inch-wide splits were among a number of faults they had to deal with .
' so sophisticated ' mr graham , tory representative on the assembly 's house committee , said the problem of increased heat in the assembly chamber , a possible cause of the split wood in the work stations , should have been anticipated .
he said : " the committee were assured that these problems , once identified , had been solved .
now we find several weeks later that this is not the case .
the senedd was officially opened by the queen on 1 march " if one is pessimistic , it will get worse , or very much worse when we have warmer weather .
" this building is meant to be so sophisticated that it should n't allow excessive heat build up , particularly when it was unoccupied .
mr graham said he feared ministers may have " rushed the project " and the labour assembly goverment should bear the blame .
maureen kelly owen , a past president of royal society of architects in wales , said the desks difficulty was typical of the " teething problems " any large , design-led building could expect .
' minor defects ' she said : " you could build an unadventurous , cavity-wall building , totally unexciting and lacking in innovation , and you would get one that would never leak , and never move , but it would be so dead boring that architecture would never move on . "
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " constructing a large-scale building will always bring up minor defects that need to be remedied .
" we are working with the contractor to resolve this matter and they will bear the cost of any remedial work as part of our fixed price contract . "
a spokesperson for contractor taylor woodrow said : " we are aware of the problem and are working with the welsh assembly to rectify it .
" the fitting out process began on schedule and was carried out within a pre-agreed timeframe . "

stagecoach , which operates the x1 service , is ready to withdraw the route claiming the humber bridge tolls are too high .
but following a meeting with local mps and bus operators , the humber bridge board has agreed to review its tolls .
board chairman david gemmell said he was " cautiously optimistic " that an agreement would be reached .
new charges but he said any decision taken to vary the tolls for bus operators had to be based on sound commercial arguments .
bus operators currently pay £ 10 each way for their vehicles to use the bridge , although from midnight on 23 april , that will increase to £ 10.90 .
the new charges were approved by the secretary of state for transport earlier this month after a public inquiry .
more than six million vehicles cross the humber bridge every year , generating approximately £ 18m .
the humber bridge board pays out £ 15m every year in repayments for the construction loan , which it is estimated will be paid off in 2032 .

the birmingham gateway redevelopment was announced in february and aims to give the ageing station a new look .
but there have been complaints that it does not mean new street - already facing congestion leading to delays - could handle any more trains .
network rail is expected to deliver its review of rail capacity in birmingham and the west midlands by mid-june .
it is looking at long-term rail growth and the challenges this would bring to the network .
passengers arriving and leaving new street station often face delays with trains held up waiting for a platform because of congestion .
the gateway project is mainly concerned with the appearance of the station , plus its shopping and facilities above the platforms .
backers of the gateway project have said their project would be a " major investment " in the public transport network but involve " minimum disruption " for passengers .
they said that confusion and distraction about the development risks birmingham 's rail transport network going unchanged for the foreseeable future .

the practice is common in spain , france and italy but can happen elsewhere .
card customers should be given a clear choice at the till to opt to be charged in either euros or uk pounds .
now the firms that provide credit cards say they are carrying out mystery shopping exercises to spot those who flout the rules .
they are also introducing improved technology which should help stop consumers being ripped off .
on a trip to continental europe over easter , money box listener richard lawrence found that hotels and shops he used were all converting his purchases immediately into uk pounds .
he told money box : " no choice was offered , the matter was n't even brought to my attention .
their attitude seemed to be you 're from the uk - you should be paying in pounds . "
dynamic conversion this practice where foreign merchants can convert purchase prices into pounds at the tills is called dynamic currency conversion , or dcc .
retailers should tell customers they have an option to pay in pounds or local currency but travellers may not understand the language .
often merchants are relying on customers reading that they have a choice on the credit card slip when they come to sign .
but that is after they have made the currency conversion at a less favourable rate than if the person paid in euros and allowed the card company to convert it later .
visa and mastercard , who run the card systems , can not stop merchants converting at the tills because that would fall foul of regulatory and anti-competition rules .
worse off nationwide 's card has always been one of the best to use abroad because unlike most others it does not impose a " foreign currency conversion charge " of 2.75 % whenever someone uses it .
money box listener richard lawrence found that by using the card abroad and agreeing to the currency conversion at point of sale you can end up around 4 % worse off on each transaction . "
whoever has the authority to do something about this should ensure it is regulated properly " mr lawrence the situation is more complicated for people using other cards because by converting at point of sale customers will be avoiding the currency conversion charge they would normally pay .
it is possible to even save money if merchants abroad offer a competitive conversion rate at the point of sale .
but in most cases card customers will probably be better off exercising their right to be charged in euros when abroad and not in uk pounds .
mr lawrence told the programme : " whoever has the authority to do something about this should ensure it is regulated properly . "
visa europe 's head of compliance , stanley scoglund , said the firm was concerned to hear what was happening as the company demands full transparency from merchants .
he said visa was carrying out spot-checks on merchants and was gradually introducing technology to allow customers buying abroad to get full information on exchange rates on credit card terminals each time they make a purchase .
bbc radio 4 's money box was broadcast on saturday 22 april 2006 at 1204 bst , and was repeated on sunday , 23 april , at 2102 bst .

the practice is common in spain , france and italy but can happen elsewhere .
card customers should be given a clear choice at the till to opt to be charged in either euros or uk pounds .
now the firms that provide credit cards say they are carrying out mystery shopping exercises to spot those who flout the rules .
they are also introducing improved technology which should help stop consumers being ripped off .
on a trip to continental europe over easter , money box listener richard lawrence found that hotels and shops he used were all converting his purchases immediately into uk pounds .
he told money box : " no choice was offered , the matter was n't even brought to my attention .
their attitude seemed to be you 're from the uk - you should be paying in pounds . "
dynamic conversion this practice where foreign merchants can convert purchase prices into pounds at the tills is called dynamic currency conversion , or dcc .
retailers should tell customers they have an option to pay in pounds or local currency but travellers may not understand the language .
often merchants are relying on customers reading that they have a choice on the credit card slip when they come to sign .
but that is after they have made the currency conversion at a less favourable rate than if the person paid in euros and allowed the card company to convert it later .
visa and mastercard , who run the card systems , can not stop merchants converting at the tills because that would fall foul of regulatory and anti-competition rules .
worse off nationwide 's card has always been one of the best to use abroad because unlike most others it does not impose a " foreign currency conversion charge " of 2.75 % whenever someone uses it .
money box listener richard lawrence found that by using the card abroad and agreeing to the currency conversion at point of sale you can end up around 4 % worse off on each transaction .
whoever has the authority to do something about this should ensure it is regulated properly mr lawrence read your comments the situation is more complicated for people using other cards because by converting at point of sale customers will be avoiding the currency conversion charge they would normally pay .
it is possible to even save money if merchants abroad offer a competitive conversion rate at the point of sale .
but in most cases card customers will probably be better off exercising their right to be charged in euros when abroad and not in uk pounds .
mr lawrence told the programme : " whoever has the authority to do something about this should ensure it is regulated properly . "
visa europe 's head of compliance , stanley scoglund , said the firm was concerned to hear what was happening as the company demands full transparency from merchants .
he said visa was carrying out spot-checks on merchants and was gradually introducing technology to allow customers buying abroad to get full information on exchange rates on credit card terminals each time they make a purchase .
