" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- germany ’ s immigration law marks one year for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .

it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .

i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " we can not solve problems without russia " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit takes place in st petersburg the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .
finding a bookcrossing book is like finding a message in a bottle , " said susanne weigand , who discovered the movement on the internet . " i liked the idea so much , i started clearing off my bookshelves and releasing the books right away , " she said . once upon a time … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a book-loving dog guards an official bookcrossing zone first founded in the united states in 2001 , bookcrossing has grown around the world and includes nearly half a million members and around 3 million registered books .
last year , the bookcrossing.com site won two " webby awards " for best community and best networking site . yet the movement in germany and europe has been slower in gaining ground . " that 's mainly because of the language barrier , " bookcrosser and german support site founder , rudi ferrari , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi ferrari : a self-confessed addict ferrari has translated the american site texts into german and maintains the german site because he says " a lot of older germans do n't speak english . " " with the german support site , more and more germans are participating as a result , " he said .
he has also created a general european support site , hoping to augment bookcrossing instructions in various european languages . as of this spring , there were over 30,000 registered german bookcrossers , though only about 20 percent are really active .
some meet regularly in cafés and at annual bookcrossing conventions . find a book , pick it up … for many , placing a book strategically in the unlikeliest of places can be fun too . " sometimes when i release a book , i wait around until someone finds it so that i can see the smile spread across their faces , " said bookcrosser alexander esser . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a book in a park on a summer day is just perfect the element of surprise and adventure involved is what drives ferrari too . " once , i released a book near the cologne city hall and it turned up three weeks later in poland , " he said . ferrari is admittedly an addict .
having released around 1,400 books in all , his record stands at nearly 300 in one day in two major cities . " spreading the word prompts sales " some critics believe bookcrossing could diminish sales for publishers since people are sharing books rather than buying them .
yet herbert utz , founder of utz verlag in munich , disagreed . " not only is bookcrossing fun , it 's a good way of promoting lesser-known authors , " he said . and , said esser : " i 've discovered books on bookcrossing that i never would have come across alone , " he said .
" i now buy two : one for myself and one to release in ' the wild ' through bookcrossing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossers log on to help " make the world a library " goldmann verlag , a subsidiary of random house , released 1,000 copies of the german translation of " paranoia , " by marc costello . " we thought there were some parallels between the fear of being followed in that novel and the whole bookcrossing adventure , " said claudia hanssen , spokeswoman for goldmann .
" bookcrossing is a wonderful platform for discussing books . " ferrari , however , lamented that book finders register only about 15 percent of the books released .
he hopes more people will participate since the goal is to " make the whole world a library . "
besides , he said , " we want to continue the fun .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .
finding a bookcrossing book is like finding a message in a bottle , " said susanne weigand , who discovered the movement on the internet . " i liked the idea so much , i started clearing off my bookshelves and releasing the books right away , " she said . once upon a time … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a book-loving dog guards an official bookcrossing zone first founded in the united states in 2001 , bookcrossing has grown around the world and includes nearly half a million members and around 3 million registered books .
last year , the bookcrossing.com site won two " webby awards " for best community and best networking site . yet the movement in germany and europe has been slower in gaining ground . " that 's mainly because of the language barrier , " bookcrosser and german support site founder , rudi ferrari , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi ferrari : a self-confessed addict ferrari has translated the american site texts into german and maintains the german site because he says " a lot of older germans do n't speak english . " " with the german support site , more and more germans are participating as a result , " he said .
he has also created a general european support site , hoping to augment bookcrossing instructions in various european languages . as of this spring , there were over 30,000 registered german bookcrossers , though only about 20 percent are really active .
some meet regularly in cafés and at annual bookcrossing conventions . find a book , pick it up … for many , placing a book strategically in the unlikeliest of places can be fun too . " sometimes when i release a book , i wait around until someone finds it so that i can see the smile spread across their faces , " said bookcrosser alexander esser . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a book in a park on a summer day is just perfect the element of surprise and adventure involved is what drives ferrari too . " once , i released a book near the cologne city hall and it turned up three weeks later in poland , " he said . ferrari is admittedly an addict .
having released around 1,400 books in all , his record stands at nearly 300 in one day in two major cities . " spreading the word prompts sales " some critics believe bookcrossing could diminish sales for publishers since people are sharing books rather than buying them .
yet herbert utz , founder of utz verlag in munich , disagreed . " not only is bookcrossing fun , it 's a good way of promoting lesser-known authors , " he said . and , said esser : " i 've discovered books on bookcrossing that i never would have come across alone , " he said .
" i now buy two : one for myself and one to release in ' the wild ' through bookcrossing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossers log on to help " make the world a library " goldmann verlag , a subsidiary of random house , released 1,000 copies of the german translation of " paranoia , " by marc costello . " we thought there were some parallels between the fear of being followed in that novel and the whole bookcrossing adventure , " said claudia hanssen , spokeswoman for goldmann .
" bookcrossing is a wonderful platform for discussing books . " ferrari , however , lamented that book finders register only about 15 percent of the books released .
he hopes more people will participate since the goal is to " make the whole world a library . "
besides , he said , " we want to continue the fun .

beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .

but bruno proved capable of overcoming his troubled life as a cub and entering a life of stardom .
not even being labeled a " problem bear " by bavarian officials was enough to stop him from expanding his international fan-base into his adopted german home . he was the first bear to be spotted in germany in 170 years .

is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .

israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .

germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .

is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " we can not solve problems without russia " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment . "
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .

in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .

the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza .

" here we think care should be taken about the situation in lebanon , which is a fragile entity as a state and could be further destabilised , " he added . plötner said berlin regretted the high number of civilian casualties the fighting has claimed on both sides and called on all parties to " break the spiral of violence . " bildunterschrift : " humanitarian aid difficult to get through " by friday morning the death toll had reached 61 ever since israel began retaliating wednesday for the capture of two israeli soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a raid across the southern lebanese border . " movement restrictions are also making it very difficult for humanitarian operators to help the people that most need it .
i strongly urge both israeli and palestinian authorities to facilitate the work of the humanitarian agencies and ensure the protection of civilians , " michel said . on thursday , the finnish presidency of the european union said the use of force by israel in lebanon in response to attacks by the lebanese-based hezbollah militia was " disproportionate . " " actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution and can not serve anyone 's legitimate security interests , " the eu presidency said in a statement . at the same time , the eu said it urged hezbollah to release two israeli soldiers it had captured " immediately and unconditionally , and to cease all attacks on israel .

he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- pipeline could bring more energy and freedom to europe officials from more than 20 countries on thursday attended the official opening of the world 's second-longest oil pipeline in ceyhan , turkey .

by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .

therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .

that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .

but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .

russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .

the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

not even being labeled a " problem bear " by bavarian officials was enough to stop him from expanding his international fan-base into his adopted german home . he was the first bear to be spotted in germany in 170 years .
his death - some say brutal murder - infuriated animal lovers , who put up crosses and laid teddy bears near the spot where he was shot . a german toymaker is producing a limited edition of 2,000 teddy bears , adorned with black ribbons , in memory of bruno . the two-meter -lrb- six foot six inches -rrb- , two-year-old bear became a household name in germany thanks to extensive media coverage before he was declared a menace and shot on june 25 . italia n s o n ly i n terested i n remai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's reintroduction with the wild ended badly in may , the bear absconded from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region , where italian authorities recently reintroduced the species , and crossed the border .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .
finding a bookcrossing book is like finding a message in a bottle , " said susanne weigand , who discovered the movement on the internet . " i liked the idea so much , i started clearing off my bookshelves and releasing the books right away , " she said . once upon a time … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a book-loving dog guards an official bookcrossing zone first founded in the united states in 2001 , bookcrossing has grown around the world and includes nearly half a million members and around 3 million registered books .
last year , the bookcrossing.com site won two " webby awards " for best community and best networking site . yet the movement in germany and europe has been slower in gaining ground . " that 's mainly because of the language barrier , " bookcrosser and german support site founder , rudi ferrari , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi ferrari : a self-confessed addict ferrari has translated the american site texts into german and maintains the german site because he says " a lot of older germans do n't speak english . " " with the german support site , more and more germans are participating as a result , " he said .
he has also created a general european support site , hoping to augment bookcrossing instructions in various european languages . as of this spring , there were over 30,000 registered german bookcrossers , though only about 20 percent are really active .
some meet regularly in cafés and at annual bookcrossing conventions . find a book , pick it up … for many , placing a book strategically in the unlikeliest of places can be fun too .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

do you thi n k that russia fits i n to this group ? harald leibrecht : the current political development in russia gives cause for concern .
we continually hear about human rights violations , restrictions on press freedom and a throwback to political centralism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is among the basic rights that have been curbed under putin when russia became a member of the g7 , there was great hope that this country would undergo positive political developments .
under putin , this hope has been crushed . i can hardly believe that today 's russia could become a g8 member .
only a politically and economically stable russia can be an asset to both the west and the g8 . germa n foreig n mi n ister fra n k-walter stei n meier rece n tly applauded i n ter n al developme n ts i n russia .
a n dreas schocke n hoff , the government 's russian policy expert adopted a n oppositio n al sta n ce to puti n at the alter n ative g8 co n fere n ce .
what is your view o n germa n y 's russia-policy ? it seems to me that the government does n't really know how it should continue dealing with russia .
they 're still making the same mistake that was made when schröder was in office .
his russia policy was always criticized by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it 's a reactive , not proactive approach . there simply is n't any identifiable political strategy .
this was apparent in the last german-russian government meetings .
economic relations are great - and the rest ?
no comment . what are your expectatio n s for the g8 summit i n st. petersburg ? i hope very much , of course , that there will be a push for concrete results on issues like iran , north korea and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leibrecht hopes for concrete solutions an iran that possesses atomic weapons would be an uncontrollable threat to us all .
that 's why we have to make it utterly clear to the heads of state at the g8 summit that iran must permanently abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that could produce plutonium for weapons . the leading g8 countries are also powerful members of the un security council , which means this conference has to send iran an unambiguous signal . the other issues that president putin emphasized for this year 's summit - education and the fight against infectious diseases - absolutely deserve stronger attention and more unified involvement from the large industrial nations . ingo mannteufel interviewed harald leibrecht -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit the g8 summit , which will be dominated by issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and energy co-operation between russia and the west , has also become a forum for russian opposition groups .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

violence continued into friday . israel broadened its offensive on lebanon on friday , with fighter bombers striking the airport and residential buildings in the southern suburbs of the capital , as well as blasting fuel storage tanks and cutting off the main highway to syria .
three people were killed and 55 wounded in the air strikes , police said .
beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza . " once again , civilians are paying the price of conflict , " said eu commissioner louis michel .
" they are the main casualties of the israeli blockades and incursions in gaza , and now in lebanon , " he said . german government : " israel has a right to defend itself " the german government on friday said israel had the right to defend itself but should think about the long-term impact of its offensive in lebanon . " on the one hand , israel has the internationally recognized right to self defense .
but at the same time we ask our israeli friends and partners not to lose sight of the long-term consequences when they exercise this right , " deputy government spokesman jens plötner said . " here we think care should be taken about the situation in lebanon , which is a fragile entity as a state and could be further destabilised , " he added . plötner said berlin regretted the high number of civilian casualties the fighting has claimed on both sides and called on all parties to " break the spiral of violence . " bildunterschrift : " humanitarian aid difficult to get through " by friday morning the death toll had reached 61 ever since israel began retaliating wednesday for the capture of two israeli soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a raid across the southern lebanese border . " movement restrictions are also making it very difficult for humanitarian operators to help the people that most need it .
i strongly urge both israeli and palestinian authorities to facilitate the work of the humanitarian agencies and ensure the protection of civilians , " michel said . on thursday , the finnish presidency of the european union said the use of force by israel in lebanon in response to attacks by the lebanese-based hezbollah militia was " disproportionate . " " actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution and can not serve anyone 's legitimate security interests , " the eu presidency said in a statement . at the same time , the eu said it urged hezbollah to release two israeli soldiers it had captured " immediately and unconditionally , and to cease all attacks on israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana will head to the middle east on saturday france has adopted a particularly sharp tone publicly regarding the israeli retaliation .
foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " this is a disproportionate act of war with very negative consequences for lebanon , especially because it runs the risk of sparking even more violence which could destabilize the whole region . " german chancellor and us president agree like the german chancellor , us president george w. bush also said israel has the right to defend itself , but should not weaken the lebanese government . the beirut government , too divided to disarm the shi 'ite faction that effectively controls south lebanon , has urged the un security council to call on israel to halt its onslaught when the top world body meets later on friday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

" the president asked an astonishing number of questions , " merkel said .
" everyone was able to see his interest in the region and its problems . " a wider view of germa n y for bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hand-picked crowd had a chance to meet bush and merkel the us president 's decision to stay in the german baltic sea town of stralsund for three days shows how deep the relationship between the two countries has become , according to gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin . " it shows the genuine friendship between him and the german chancellor , " he said .
" bush is taking an interest in developments in eastern germany .
what he 'll have seen are some success stories , but also the negative impact of reunification in many eastern parts -lrb- of germany -rrb- . " though only 1,000 of the 5,000 protesters organizers expected actually showed up , some ordinary people in stralsund argued that the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- spent on security for the visit would have been better spent on creating new jobs in the region and improving its infrastructure .
a survey showed nearly half of the people in mecklenburg-western pomerania were against bush 's visit . perso n al ties good for bush a n d merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests did n't reach the size organizers expected but others believe that the visit was important to solidify us-german relations which suffered a setback under former german chancellor gerhard schröder , due to his government 's outright rejection of the us-led war on iraq . merkel 's stance on iraq is n't all that different , but she 's managed to build up a relationship of trust with the us administration - that schröder could only dream of - at a time when it seems washington is reaching out to other european allies after leaders close to bush have been voted out of office in spain and italy . bush praised merkel and said she is a person with " a bold vision and a humble heart " who he is " proud to call a good friend . " respect for merkel 's opi n io n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders found common ground on several world issues " the american people and the german people see the same qualities and character in your nation 's leader , " bush added .
" i respect her judgment and i value her opinion . " merkel also pointed out that politics were not completely absent from the visit . " we found we had a lot of common ground on a number of points , " she said .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .
there are now more tourists than journalists lingering around when the court is in session . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia fails to meet eu ultimatum to arrest mladic the european union 's ultimatum to serbia to arrest key war crimes suspect ratko mladic expired on monday with the former bosnian serb wartime military commander still at large .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .

in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .

in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .

the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .

he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " israel was massively provoked " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stürmer : hezbolla knew what would happend when they kidnapped the israeli soldiers german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany . micha el stürmer is o n e of germa n y 's best-k n ow n historia n s .
he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .
there are now more tourists than journalists lingering around when the court is in session . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia fails to meet eu ultimatum to arrest mladic the european union 's ultimatum to serbia to arrest key war crimes suspect ratko mladic expired on monday with the former bosnian serb wartime military commander still at large .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- pipeline could bring more energy and freedom to europe officials from more than 20 countries on thursday attended the official opening of the world 's second-longest oil pipeline in ceyhan , turkey .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .

violence continued into friday . israel broadened its offensive on lebanon on friday , with fighter bombers striking the airport and residential buildings in the southern suburbs of the capital , as well as blasting fuel storage tanks and cutting off the main highway to syria .
three people were killed and 55 wounded in the air strikes , police said .
beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza .

i strongly urge both israeli and palestinian authorities to facilitate the work of the humanitarian agencies and ensure the protection of civilians , " michel said . on thursday , the finnish presidency of the european union said the use of force by israel in lebanon in response to attacks by the lebanese-based hezbollah militia was " disproportionate . " " actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution and can not serve anyone 's legitimate security interests , " the eu presidency said in a statement . at the same time , the eu said it urged hezbollah to release two israeli soldiers it had captured " immediately and unconditionally , and to cease all attacks on israel .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " we can not solve problems without russia " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit takes place in st petersburg the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .

in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .

violence continued into friday . israel broadened its offensive on lebanon on friday , with fighter bombers striking the airport and residential buildings in the southern suburbs of the capital , as well as blasting fuel storage tanks and cutting off the main highway to syria .
three people were killed and 55 wounded in the air strikes , police said .
beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza . " once again , civilians are paying the price of conflict , " said eu commissioner louis michel .
" they are the main casualties of the israeli blockades and incursions in gaza , and now in lebanon , " he said . german government : " israel has a right to defend itself " the german government on friday said israel had the right to defend itself but should think about the long-term impact of its offensive in lebanon . " on the one hand , israel has the internationally recognized right to self defense .
but at the same time we ask our israeli friends and partners not to lose sight of the long-term consequences when they exercise this right , " deputy government spokesman jens plötner said . " here we think care should be taken about the situation in lebanon , which is a fragile entity as a state and could be further destabilised , " he added . plötner said berlin regretted the high number of civilian casualties the fighting has claimed on both sides and called on all parties to " break the spiral of violence . " bildunterschrift : " humanitarian aid difficult to get through " by friday morning the death toll had reached 61 ever since israel began retaliating wednesday for the capture of two israeli soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a raid across the southern lebanese border . " movement restrictions are also making it very difficult for humanitarian operators to help the people that most need it .
i strongly urge both israeli and palestinian authorities to facilitate the work of the humanitarian agencies and ensure the protection of civilians , " michel said . on thursday , the finnish presidency of the european union said the use of force by israel in lebanon in response to attacks by the lebanese-based hezbollah militia was " disproportionate . " " actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution and can not serve anyone 's legitimate security interests , " the eu presidency said in a statement . at the same time , the eu said it urged hezbollah to release two israeli soldiers it had captured " immediately and unconditionally , and to cease all attacks on israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana will head to the middle east on saturday france has adopted a particularly sharp tone publicly regarding the israeli retaliation .
foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " this is a disproportionate act of war with very negative consequences for lebanon , especially because it runs the risk of sparking even more violence which could destabilize the whole region . " german chancellor and us president agree like the german chancellor , us president george w. bush also said israel has the right to defend itself , but should not weaken the lebanese government . the beirut government , too divided to disarm the shi 'ite faction that effectively controls south lebanon , has urged the un security council to call on israel to halt its onslaught when the top world body meets later on friday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .

"
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .

" the bear is the property of the state of bavaria , " the state 's environment minister werner schnappauf told reporters thursday , adding that the animal 's remains would be used for " scientific purposes .

not even being labeled a " problem bear " by bavarian officials was enough to stop him from expanding his international fan-base into his adopted german home . he was the first bear to be spotted in germany in 170 years .
his death - some say brutal murder - infuriated animal lovers , who put up crosses and laid teddy bears near the spot where he was shot . a german toymaker is producing a limited edition of 2,000 teddy bears , adorned with black ribbons , in memory of bruno . the two-meter -lrb- six foot six inches -rrb- , two-year-old bear became a household name in germany thanks to extensive media coverage before he was declared a menace and shot on june 25 . italia n s o n ly i n terested i n remai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's reintroduction with the wild ended badly in may , the bear absconded from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region , where italian authorities recently reintroduced the species , and crossed the border .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .
finding a bookcrossing book is like finding a message in a bottle , " said susanne weigand , who discovered the movement on the internet . " i liked the idea so much , i started clearing off my bookshelves and releasing the books right away , " she said . once upon a time … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a book-loving dog guards an official bookcrossing zone first founded in the united states in 2001 , bookcrossing has grown around the world and includes nearly half a million members and around 3 million registered books .
last year , the bookcrossing.com site won two " webby awards " for best community and best networking site . yet the movement in germany and europe has been slower in gaining ground . " that 's mainly because of the language barrier , " bookcrosser and german support site founder , rudi ferrari , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi ferrari : a self-confessed addict ferrari has translated the american site texts into german and maintains the german site because he says " a lot of older germans do n't speak english .

but bruno proved capable of overcoming his troubled life as a cub and entering a life of stardom .
not even being labeled a " problem bear " by bavarian officials was enough to stop him from expanding his international fan-base into his adopted german home . he was the first bear to be spotted in germany in 170 years .
his death - some say brutal murder - infuriated animal lovers , who put up crosses and laid teddy bears near the spot where he was shot . a german toymaker is producing a limited edition of 2,000 teddy bears , adorned with black ribbons , in memory of bruno . the two-meter -lrb- six foot six inches -rrb- , two-year-old bear became a household name in germany thanks to extensive media coverage before he was declared a menace and shot on june 25 . italia n s o n ly i n terested i n remai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno 's reintroduction with the wild ended badly in may , the bear absconded from the adamello-brenta nature reserve in italy 's northern trentino region , where italian authorities recently reintroduced the species , and crossed the border .

is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .

when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .

he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

violence continued into friday . israel broadened its offensive on lebanon on friday , with fighter bombers striking the airport and residential buildings in the southern suburbs of the capital , as well as blasting fuel storage tanks and cutting off the main highway to syria .
three people were killed and 55 wounded in the air strikes , police said .
beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza . " once again , civilians are paying the price of conflict , " said eu commissioner louis michel .
" they are the main casualties of the israeli blockades and incursions in gaza , and now in lebanon , " he said . german government : " israel has a right to defend itself " the german government on friday said israel had the right to defend itself but should think about the long-term impact of its offensive in lebanon . " on the one hand , israel has the internationally recognized right to self defense .
but at the same time we ask our israeli friends and partners not to lose sight of the long-term consequences when they exercise this right , " deputy government spokesman jens plötner said . " here we think care should be taken about the situation in lebanon , which is a fragile entity as a state and could be further destabilised , " he added . plötner said berlin regretted the high number of civilian casualties the fighting has claimed on both sides and called on all parties to " break the spiral of violence . " bildunterschrift : " humanitarian aid difficult to get through " by friday morning the death toll had reached 61 ever since israel began retaliating wednesday for the capture of two israeli soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a raid across the southern lebanese border . " movement restrictions are also making it very difficult for humanitarian operators to help the people that most need it .
i strongly urge both israeli and palestinian authorities to facilitate the work of the humanitarian agencies and ensure the protection of civilians , " michel said . on thursday , the finnish presidency of the european union said the use of force by israel in lebanon in response to attacks by the lebanese-based hezbollah militia was " disproportionate . " " actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution and can not serve anyone 's legitimate security interests , " the eu presidency said in a statement . at the same time , the eu said it urged hezbollah to release two israeli soldiers it had captured " immediately and unconditionally , and to cease all attacks on israel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana will head to the middle east on saturday france has adopted a particularly sharp tone publicly regarding the israeli retaliation .
foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said : " this is a disproportionate act of war with very negative consequences for lebanon , especially because it runs the risk of sparking even more violence which could destabilize the whole region . " german chancellor and us president agree like the german chancellor , us president george w. bush also said israel has the right to defend itself , but should not weaken the lebanese government . the beirut government , too divided to disarm the shi 'ite faction that effectively controls south lebanon , has urged the un security council to call on israel to halt its onslaught when the top world body meets later on friday . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

" the president asked an astonishing number of questions , " merkel said .
" everyone was able to see his interest in the region and its problems . " a wider view of germa n y for bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hand-picked crowd had a chance to meet bush and merkel the us president 's decision to stay in the german baltic sea town of stralsund for three days shows how deep the relationship between the two countries has become , according to gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin . " it shows the genuine friendship between him and the german chancellor , " he said .
" bush is taking an interest in developments in eastern germany .
what he 'll have seen are some success stories , but also the negative impact of reunification in many eastern parts -lrb- of germany -rrb- . " though only 1,000 of the 5,000 protesters organizers expected actually showed up , some ordinary people in stralsund argued that the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- spent on security for the visit would have been better spent on creating new jobs in the region and improving its infrastructure .
a survey showed nearly half of the people in mecklenburg-western pomerania were against bush 's visit . perso n al ties good for bush a n d merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests did n't reach the size organizers expected but others believe that the visit was important to solidify us-german relations which suffered a setback under former german chancellor gerhard schröder , due to his government 's outright rejection of the us-led war on iraq . merkel 's stance on iraq is n't all that different , but she 's managed to build up a relationship of trust with the us administration - that schröder could only dream of - at a time when it seems washington is reaching out to other european allies after leaders close to bush have been voted out of office in spain and italy . bush praised merkel and said she is a person with " a bold vision and a humble heart " who he is " proud to call a good friend . " respect for merkel 's opi n io n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders found common ground on several world issues " the american people and the german people see the same qualities and character in your nation 's leader , " bush added .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .

europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " we can not solve problems without russia " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit takes place in st petersburg the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " israel was massively provoked " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stürmer : hezbolla knew what would happend when they kidnapped the israeli soldiers german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany . micha el stürmer is o n e of germa n y 's best-k n ow n historia n s .
he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

" the president asked an astonishing number of questions , " merkel said .
" everyone was able to see his interest in the region and its problems . " a wider view of germa n y for bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hand-picked crowd had a chance to meet bush and merkel the us president 's decision to stay in the german baltic sea town of stralsund for three days shows how deep the relationship between the two countries has become , according to gary smith , director of the american academy in berlin . " it shows the genuine friendship between him and the german chancellor , " he said .
" bush is taking an interest in developments in eastern germany .
what he 'll have seen are some success stories , but also the negative impact of reunification in many eastern parts -lrb- of germany -rrb- . " though only 1,000 of the 5,000 protesters organizers expected actually showed up , some ordinary people in stralsund argued that the 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- spent on security for the visit would have been better spent on creating new jobs in the region and improving its infrastructure .
a survey showed nearly half of the people in mecklenburg-western pomerania were against bush 's visit . perso n al ties good for bush a n d merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests did n't reach the size organizers expected but others believe that the visit was important to solidify us-german relations which suffered a setback under former german chancellor gerhard schröder , due to his government 's outright rejection of the us-led war on iraq . merkel 's stance on iraq is n't all that different , but she 's managed to build up a relationship of trust with the us administration - that schröder could only dream of - at a time when it seems washington is reaching out to other european allies after leaders close to bush have been voted out of office in spain and italy . bush praised merkel and said she is a person with " a bold vision and a humble heart " who he is " proud to call a good friend . " respect for merkel 's opi n io n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leaders found common ground on several world issues " the american people and the german people see the same qualities and character in your nation 's leader , " bush added .
" i respect her judgment and i value her opinion . " merkel also pointed out that politics were not completely absent from the visit . " we found we had a lot of common ground on a number of points , " she said .
" we talked about iran , the middle east , the issue of north korea and relations with china to find our common interests . " hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .

it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .

and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- april 27 , 2006 -rrb- pipeline could bring more energy and freedom to europe officials from more than 20 countries on thursday attended the official opening of the world 's second-longest oil pipeline in ceyhan , turkey .
it provides europe with an energy alternative to the middle east and russia .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

do you thi n k that russia fits i n to this group ? harald leibrecht : the current political development in russia gives cause for concern .
we continually hear about human rights violations , restrictions on press freedom and a throwback to political centralism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is among the basic rights that have been curbed under putin when russia became a member of the g7 , there was great hope that this country would undergo positive political developments .
under putin , this hope has been crushed . i can hardly believe that today 's russia could become a g8 member .
only a politically and economically stable russia can be an asset to both the west and the g8 . germa n foreig n mi n ister fra n k-walter stei n meier rece n tly applauded i n ter n al developme n ts i n russia .

what is your view o n germa n y 's russia-policy ? it seems to me that the government does n't really know how it should continue dealing with russia .
they 're still making the same mistake that was made when schröder was in office .
his russia policy was always criticized by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it 's a reactive , not proactive approach . there simply is n't any identifiable political strategy .
this was apparent in the last german-russian government meetings .
economic relations are great - and the rest ?
no comment . what are your expectatio n s for the g8 summit i n st. petersburg ? i hope very much , of course , that there will be a push for concrete results on issues like iran , north korea and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leibrecht hopes for concrete solutions an iran that possesses atomic weapons would be an uncontrollable threat to us all .
that 's why we have to make it utterly clear to the heads of state at the g8 summit that iran must permanently abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that could produce plutonium for weapons . the leading g8 countries are also powerful members of the un security council , which means this conference has to send iran an unambiguous signal . the other issues that president putin emphasized for this year 's summit - education and the fight against infectious diseases - absolutely deserve stronger attention and more unified involvement from the large industrial nations . ingo mannteufel interviewed harald leibrecht -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit the g8 summit , which will be dominated by issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and energy co-operation between russia and the west , has also become a forum for russian opposition groups .

do you thi n k that russia fits i n to this group ? harald leibrecht : the current political development in russia gives cause for concern .
we continually hear about human rights violations , restrictions on press freedom and a throwback to political centralism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is among the basic rights that have been curbed under putin when russia became a member of the g7 , there was great hope that this country would undergo positive political developments .
under putin , this hope has been crushed . i can hardly believe that today 's russia could become a g8 member .

what is your view o n germa n y 's russia-policy ? it seems to me that the government does n't really know how it should continue dealing with russia .
they 're still making the same mistake that was made when schröder was in office .
his russia policy was always criticized by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it 's a reactive , not proactive approach . there simply is n't any identifiable political strategy .
this was apparent in the last german-russian government meetings .
economic relations are great - and the rest ?
no comment . what are your expectatio n s for the g8 summit i n st. petersburg ? i hope very much , of course , that there will be a push for concrete results on issues like iran , north korea and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leibrecht hopes for concrete solutions an iran that possesses atomic weapons would be an uncontrollable threat to us all .
that 's why we have to make it utterly clear to the heads of state at the g8 summit that iran must permanently abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that could produce plutonium for weapons . the leading g8 countries are also powerful members of the un security council , which means this conference has to send iran an unambiguous signal . the other issues that president putin emphasized for this year 's summit - education and the fight against infectious diseases - absolutely deserve stronger attention and more unified involvement from the large industrial nations . ingo mannteufel interviewed harald leibrecht -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit the g8 summit , which will be dominated by issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and energy co-operation between russia and the west , has also become a forum for russian opposition groups .

the trend 's catching on in germany too . australian kate hairsine stumbled upon a book by germany 's master poet johann wolfgang von goethe in the strangest of places .
it was wrapped in plastic and dangling from a statue above a fountain in the middle of karlsruhe , germany , where she lives . " i kicked off my shoes and waded into the water to fetch it .
i knew it must be a bookcrossing book ! " she said . a quirky way for book lovers to both get their hands on titles and share favorite books with others , bookcrossing has grown into a global phenomenon . hairsine first heard about it in australia . " i desperately wanted to find a book because i felt like i was missing out on what i think is a great cultural experience of finding a random book to read , " she said .
" books are meant to be read and shared and not to collect dust on a bookshelf . " the thrill of discovering a book bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookcrossers meet in cologne to share their treasures bookcrossers " release " books into the wild .
they place books in public places to be found and read by someone else .
stickers on the book covers announce that it is a bookcrossing book and also display an identification number . optimally , a book finder takes the book home , logs on to the bookcrossing site and enters the identification number along with a journal entry about how he or she found the book . the " book releaser " gets an e-mail notification of the entry and can thus keep track of the travels the book makes .
book releasers and book finders can also converse online using nicknames . whether it 's stumbling upon a book at an " official bookcrossing zone " - generally , on shelves in cafés - or finding one in the wild , there 's little doubt that the discovery is the most thrilling part of the phenomenon . " you have to love adventures to do it .
finding a bookcrossing book is like finding a message in a bottle , " said susanne weigand , who discovered the movement on the internet . " i liked the idea so much , i started clearing off my bookshelves and releasing the books right away , " she said . once upon a time … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a book-loving dog guards an official bookcrossing zone first founded in the united states in 2001 , bookcrossing has grown around the world and includes nearly half a million members and around 3 million registered books .
last year , the bookcrossing.com site won two " webby awards " for best community and best networking site . yet the movement in germany and europe has been slower in gaining ground . " that 's mainly because of the language barrier , " bookcrosser and german support site founder , rudi ferrari , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi ferrari : a self-confessed addict ferrari has translated the american site texts into german and maintains the german site because he says " a lot of older germans do n't speak english . " " with the german support site , more and more germans are participating as a result , " he said .
he has also created a general european support site , hoping to augment bookcrossing instructions in various european languages . as of this spring , there were over 30,000 registered german bookcrossers , though only about 20 percent are really active .
some meet regularly in cafés and at annual bookcrossing conventions . find a book , pick it up … for many , placing a book strategically in the unlikeliest of places can be fun too . " sometimes when i release a book , i wait around until someone finds it so that i can see the smile spread across their faces , " said bookcrosser alexander esser . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a book in a park on a summer day is just perfect the element of surprise and adventure involved is what drives ferrari too .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .
will she stick to this stance during her visit in st. petersburg ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- r -rrb- did n't avoid difficult subject with putin of course .
we want to make it understood that russia 's domestic developments are also important to us .
it was exactly for this reason that i was sent by the german government to attend " the other russia " conference .
to show that we think it is important .
to show that we realize that russia is not homogeneous , but instead that it is multifaceted .
in this respect , angela merkel 's style is completely different from that of her predecessor -lrb- gerhard schröder -rrb- .
therefore , i think that she has more authority in russia , and still has developed a strong foundation of trust with president putin . angela merkel met with us president george w. bush before the summit .
are there basic differences in the two countries ' policies towards russia ? i do n't think so .
i think that the us state department has recognized that russia is a significant partner .
without russia , we then would have great difficulties getting across our interests in extremely difficult regions of the world .
therefore , i believe , it will be of the essence for the us and germany to complement each other in the attempt to bring russia into the same boat as a responsible partner . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .

he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview . the group of eight industrialized nations meet in russia for the first time in the group 's history . the g8 countries are currently facing a multitude of problems . at the summit in st. petersburg this weekend , the world 's differences with iran , north korea , but also the tense situation in the middle east are certain to be on the agenda . but for russia to become an equal partner with the other seven g8 countries , moscow needs to further modernize and democratize . dw-world.de spoke with the german government 's russian expert about these topics and more . dw-world.de : the kremlin did n't want representatives from the g8 to visit the alternative discussion forum " the other russia . "
you did .
why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schockenhoff has underscored the need to work together with russia andreas schockenhoff : i think that we have to send a signal that we support the whole spectrum of russian society .
in moscow , i met ella pamfilova , who is the -lrb- russian -rrb- president 's commissioner for civil society .
but i also went to " the other russia " which was organized independently of the -lrb- putin -rrb- administration by non-government organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- .
i think that is the right balance . what impressions did you come away with from that event ? one of the problems was that there was a diverse mix of participants . there were several ngos that are well- known and have done good work for years .
unfortunately , there were also radical groups from the right and the left and who used the meeting to their own advantage .
all in all , it was a very broad and colorful picture of russian society . but the fact that this picture is possible in russia , and that it can appear in public , shows that developments are being made .
in addition , president putin agreed at the meeting organized by ms. pamfilova last week that those parts of the ngo law that hinder ngos in their work would be amended .
there are hopeful signs that the democratic path is being stuck to in russia despite many setbacks . will this event in any way influence the content and the tone of discussions during the g8 summit ? i do n't think so .
putin will bring up the topic of non-government organizations and civil society at the g8 summit .
the final statement from the summit should also include a passage about it and there should be agreement that the meetings with civil society groups should be continued next year under the german presidency . what are the most important topics for germany at this summit ?
does the german delegation have concrete goals and tasks ? i think that the current crises around the world - iran , and particulary the most recent developments in the middle east should give us cause for great worry . that will definitely be a topic . looking at strategic matters , i believe first and foremost we will deal with a european energy charter and under the auspices of the g8 , there will be an agreement to set specific ways of dealing with energy - specifically , the energy itself and its delivery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian-ukrainian gas spat worried the west this winter but the focus will also be on the routes of delivery and about how we can create secure , stable political conditions in those countries which are serve as transit nations for delivering energy . we have to also address the increasing hunger for energy in transition countries as well as developing countries .
but while doing that , we must make sure that in order to get access to energy , we do not break certain rules and codes of conduct with regard to those countries that deliver oil . it has to do with upholding the rule of law , human rights , creating transparency , and complying with international standards .
i think that the topic of energy is a multifaceted one and it 's also one of the top topics in global cooperation . russia has still failed to ratify the european energy charter .
does europe have any new arguments that will convince russia to take that step ? ratification is a legal question .
i think we have to realize politically that we are dependent on each other .
russia profits naturally from the enormous demand for energy .
russia has the second-largest oil reserves and the largest natural gas reserves .
but russia wants to and must modernize .
and in the long term , russia wo n't only be able to expand its power in the world with its oil and gas reserves .
that 's why russia also has an interest in being a partner with europe , but also with the united states , to modernize its economy and also its society . what will the eu do if russia goes through with its threat to concentrate its energy market in china and other asian countries ? it 's natural of course for russia to turn to the asian energy market , say china .
russia is not solely oriented towards the west .
but for modernization , china is n't a possible partner .
that is why europe and russia are dependent on each other .
in fact , i think that we have a common identity .
we have a common historical and cultural identity .
and i think we should use these strategic questions to develop a common set of values . leading up to the summit , criticism has been growing that russia is not fit for the g8 , neither economically nor politically .
moscow should instead be granted observer status .
what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil companies like yukos are leading the russian economy i do n't believe that .
we ca n't solve any of the current , truly global questions , those that affect western industrialized countries , without russia .
that applies to the current crises in the world - for example , iran , the nuclear proliferation of iran .
there is the middle east .
and the dangers on the korean peninsula where after north korea 's recent atomic tests , tensions have risen .
we can not solve all of these questions without working together closely with russia . but even the long-term questions strategic issues such as the management of global resources , and environmental questions and many other topics can not be solved without russia .
that is why russia is a strategic partner .
by strategic , i mean that we must work closely together with russia not only in individual cases , but in all important global matters .
and i think we have to work on a common foundation of values . it is for this reason that we are interested in russia 's internal developments .
that is why we also express our concerns when these domestic developments are going down the wrong path .
that is n't meant as an attack against russia , rather it 's the result of the realization that in the 21st century we are dependent on each other and that russia 's internal developments also directly affect our own interests . on her first state visit , angela merkel made it clear that she is ready to bring up " difficult " subjects with putin .

do you thi n k that russia fits i n to this group ? harald leibrecht : the current political development in russia gives cause for concern .
we continually hear about human rights violations , restrictions on press freedom and a throwback to political centralism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom is among the basic rights that have been curbed under putin when russia became a member of the g7 , there was great hope that this country would undergo positive political developments .
under putin , this hope has been crushed . i can hardly believe that today 's russia could become a g8 member .
only a politically and economically stable russia can be an asset to both the west and the g8 . germa n foreig n mi n ister fra n k-walter stei n meier rece n tly applauded i n ter n al developme n ts i n russia .
a n dreas schocke n hoff , the government 's russian policy expert adopted a n oppositio n al sta n ce to puti n at the alter n ative g8 co n fere n ce .
what is your view o n germa n y 's russia-policy ? it seems to me that the government does n't really know how it should continue dealing with russia .
they 're still making the same mistake that was made when schröder was in office .
his russia policy was always criticized by the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
it 's a reactive , not proactive approach . there simply is n't any identifiable political strategy .
this was apparent in the last german-russian government meetings .
economic relations are great - and the rest ?
no comment . what are your expectatio n s for the g8 summit i n st. petersburg ? i hope very much , of course , that there will be a push for concrete results on issues like iran , north korea and energy security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leibrecht hopes for concrete solutions an iran that possesses atomic weapons would be an uncontrollable threat to us all .
that 's why we have to make it utterly clear to the heads of state at the g8 summit that iran must permanently abandon the nuclear fuel cycle that could produce plutonium for weapons . the leading g8 countries are also powerful members of the un security council , which means this conference has to send iran an unambiguous signal . the other issues that president putin emphasized for this year 's summit - education and the fight against infectious diseases - absolutely deserve stronger attention and more unified involvement from the large industrial nations . ingo mannteufel interviewed harald leibrecht -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit the g8 summit , which will be dominated by issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and energy co-operation between russia and the west , has also become a forum for russian opposition groups .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action .

washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .

there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .

israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .

germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .

one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- germany ’ s immigration law marks one year for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country .
-lrb- july 6 , 2006 -rrb- testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

"
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .

" those who want to live among us must accept that this will involve a certain amount of effort , " the chancellor told a one-day national conference on integration in berlin . the meeting include 85 invited guests , including representatives of immigrant groups , national , regional sports and business officials . encouraging immigrants , rather than new rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is finally coming to grips with its multi-ethnic society the meeting came two months after germany 's 16 states decided to make foreigners pass language tests to qualify for german nationality amid concern that existing policies had failed to create a cohesive multi-cultural society .
but merkel said friday 's meeting was more about ways to encourage foreigners to learn the language and the culture of their new home than about imposing new rules . " we discussed ideas like adding turkish subtitles to german movies to help those who have not quite mastered the language , and to enroll children in kindergartens so that they can learn at a young age , " the chancellor said . her minister delegate for integration , maria böhmer , this week proposed giving immigrant families free access to pre-school child care to allow their offspring to learn german before they start school . a report published by the organisation for economic cooperation and development in may noted that the school results of children from immigrant families in germany were poorer than in most industrialised nations . the findings and outbreaks of violence in schools in areas with high immigrant populations fueled a debate about whether germany had an alienated immigrant youth population capable of the strife seen late last year in french suburbs . merkel in no hurry merkel said she would not be rushed on finding a new policy framework for the country with its 15 million citizens of foreign origin . " there is no point in putting ourselves under pressure .
we can take one more year and come up with a workable strategy , " the chancellor told reporters . the conference was billed as the first of several such meetings and brought together politicians , leaders of immigrant populations , businessmen and trade unionists .
merkel hailed it as a " historic event . " labor minister franz müntefering said the business world was invited to give its input as job creation was considered a vital part of integration . " every job -lrb- filled by an immigrant -rrb- is a practical example of integration , " he said .
the conference was welcomed by kenan kolat , the leader of germany 's turkish community , which is the biggest outside turkey .
" for once the political class is speaking to immigrants instead of speaking about integration , " he said . opposition remains skeptical but , opposition parties in government are skeptical that the integration efforts will lead to anything concrete , and germany 's islamic council and the central council of muslims have complained that they were not invited to the summit . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " israel was massively provoked " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stürmer : hezbolla knew what would happend when they kidnapped the israeli soldiers german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany . micha el stürmer is o n e of germa n y 's best-k n ow n historia n s .
he teaches at the u n iversity of erla n ge n a n d has writte n exte n sively o n the middle east co n flict , i n cludi n g co-editi n g a book , called " allies divided .
atla n tic security a n d the greater middle east . " dw-world.de : israel 's attack is bei n g viewed by ma n y as offe n sive i n stead of defe n sive .
is that the case , i n your opi n io n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the militant hamas is a pan-arab movement set on revolution michael stürmer : the israeli attack was not an unprovoked one .
there were two very deliberate , focused attacks and both the hamas leadership and hezbollah leadership know extremely well that israel 's defense forces do n't leave their own people alive or dead in the lurch .
this is only the primer .
what we see on the television screen is only the foreground .
in the background you have a much more complicated problem - a real gordian knot of problems . one is that hamas is a much wider pan-arab movement - as opposed to fatah , which is a palestinian nationalist movement .
it 's a revolutionary movement which is not only directed against israel as a state , but also against the regimes in egypt , saudi arabia , jordan , etc .
hamas is backed up from tehran and maybe also from other parts of the arab world .
hezbollah is also backed from tehran and syria .
both tehran and syria play a very important role in it . do you thi n k that israel had alter n atives to a military attack ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " here i am at your service mohammed " read the bandanas of hezbollah marchers all the wise , great and the good tell you that diplomacy is the answer .
if your people are taken away , shot , bombed , and blown up - then diplomacy obviously is n't very helpful .
israel is a democracy .
they have to do something .
they have to show the people that the state protects them and that the israeli defense forces are not there just for show but for real .
israel was massively provoked .
they have held back for a long time and they 've withdrawn from gaza .
-lrb- prime minister ehud -rrb- olmert has announced that they will also withdraw from large parts of the west bank , which makes sense and is more or less inevitable . what we have now is that the hamas leadership is trying to keep israel within this hornet 's nest called gaza in order to bleed israel and revolutionize the middle east in the hamas sense .
this is a very old pattern .
it occurred in europe ; it 's occurring in the middle east .
you have a revolutionary , trans-national movement transcending the state structure and this is precisely what hamas wants .
sacrificing a few hundred or a few thousand civilians does n't matter at all .
these are nihilistic people pretending to do the work of allah . germa n y has traditio n ally bee n very pro-israel , i n part due to its history with the jews , but also prefers dialogue over military actio n .
do you thi n k germa n y feels obligated to support israel because of traditio n al ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud omert 's -lrb- l -rrb- israel will eventually require us support , stürmer said every reasonable person , including the government of israel , prefers dialogue over action .
but what if dialogue leads you nowhere ?
or what if dialogue means you just have to suffer very heavy blows ?
germany is in the lurch .
we have always gone through the eu in unpleasant things concerning the middle east , whereas in the bilateral relationship we 've always been very much pro-israel . nowadays , we are of two minds .
on the one hand , we are giving - and partly selling - to israel the only submarines they have .
on the other hand , we are very fussy about ball-bearings for the merkava 4 tanks .
i can not really see a clear line from the berlin government .
when it comes to words , we are very pro-israel .
when it comes to practical deeds , we are not so helpful .
we do cooperate in research and development , from agriculture to high-tech .
what will happen if this war of low intensity develops into a very hot , fast-moving war ?
if israel comes to the end of its military sustainability very soon , god only knows what will happen .
then it 's up to the americans . israel 's n ew gover n me n t is short o n war experie n ce .
how lo n g will the cou n try be able to hold out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael stürmer the israelis have endured and have supported this kind of thing for many years , indeed .
when they invaded lebanon in 1982 they stayed there for 18 years altogether .
but there were strings attached when they withdrew .
one condition was , you do n't fire cartouches into northern israel and we do n't invade .
this silent agreement was never a written one but there was a clear understanding and it was also supported by egypt and others .
this has been broken in a very massive way .
everybody on the hezbollah side knew what would happen if they hijacked israeli soldiers and killed people . kate bowen interviewed michael stürmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .
violence has continued into friday .

-lrb- may 10 , 2006 -rrb- merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : g8 summit in st petersburg " we can not solve problems without russia " " germany 's russia-policy is not proactive enough " russia to host middle east crisis talks at g8 summit russian dissidents stage alternative to g8 summit europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 " the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment . "
russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .
russia is definitely highly respected and recognized .
but it would be wise for russia not to confuse its own interests with larger power issues .
you can bring your own interests to bear best when you connect them with the interests of others . tatiana petrenko conducted the interview -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

russia and europe are dependent on each other when it comes to energy issues and would do well to realize it , a german parliamentarian told dw-world.de. gert weisskirchen is the social democratic party 's parliamentary spokesperson for foreign affairs and the head of the german-russian parliamentary group . dw-world.de : russia originally chose energy security to be the main topic of discussion for the group of eight summit , but the current issues of iran , north korea and palestine have come up .
even before the focus was put on these new issues , there were a number of experts who criticized the meeting for taking on more than it could handle .
do you share that opinion ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in the middle east has taken over the g8 agenda gert weisskirchen : i think that it is definitely a good opportunity to observe all the world 's current conflicts , which are unfortunately also becoming more heated , and to discuss them with each other so that the world 's powers can make a shared contribution to solving these problems peacefully . what are the most important topics for germany at the summit ?
what concrete tasks have the german delegates set themselves ? germany naturally has a large interest in seeing the g8 cooperate multilaterally .
that is why germany is trying to defuse the conflicts and contribute to making the world a better and more peaceful place .
we want to hope that powerful countries like the usa and especially the growing powers , such as china as well as russia , are ready to take part in shared efforts . although questions of international politics have moved into center stage , the topic of energy security is still key to all sides .
what are the most important conditions that need to be fulfilled for russia to be seen as a secure european partner on these issues ? those who produce energy , those who transport energy and those who consume energy - they have three interests .
these interests needs to be coordinated with each other , not against each other .
the energy charta would , for example , provide this type of platform , and i really hope that the talks in st. petersburg bring us a step closer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe gets much of its gas from russia what kinds of methods would europeans be prepared to use to convince russia to ratify the european energy charta , should the russians continue in their refusal to do so ? for its own internal interests , russia naturally wants to streamline and try to get the most out of their resource production .
russia 's own economic abilities can not successfully do this , russia needs outside investors to achieve it .
this makes it clear that we are reliant on each other - and even more than that , are dependent on each other .
the energy producer is just as dependent on being able to sell its energy as the people who are buying the energy .
spying on or taking advantage of each other is not what is necessary at the moment , but a shared balancing of interests .
i hope russia will accept the energy charta as this kind of offer . could it be expected that russia changes it orientation to asian enegry markets when it is put under pressure ? russia is not being put under any pressure .
the g8 is looking for an exchange of interests .
as far as the energy topic is concerned , there is no pressure being applied .
this is an extremely important topic that all europeans need to try not to think about in terms of power but of integration .
i hope that moscow will turn away from the old power games . criticism that russia does not politically or economically belong in the g8 and that it should have observer status got louder and louder as the summit approached .
what is your opinion on this ? russia is a global player and very self-confident at the moment , and that is understandable when looking at the last 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.07.2006 eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli air raid targeted a bridge in southern lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .
violence continued into friday . israel broadened its offensive on lebanon on friday , with fighter bombers striking the airport and residential buildings in the southern suburbs of the capital , as well as blasting fuel storage tanks and cutting off the main highway to syria .
three people were killed and 55 wounded in the air strikes , police said .
beirut airport officials said one of their three runways was hit by an israeli missile on friday morning . the escalating crossborder violence - the worst in a decade - has also sparked a strong response from the eu . the european union 's top humanitarian aid official has called on israeli and palestinian authorities to make sure humanitarian agencies can still do their work in the areas affected by the recent conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel storage tanks burning at rafik hariri international airport in beirut on friday the 25-nation eu also approved an additional 50 million euros -lrb- $ 63 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid to meet the needs of the palestinians in the west bank and gaza . " once again , civilians are paying the price of conflict , " said eu commissioner louis michel .
" they are the main casualties of the israeli blockades and incursions in gaza , and now in lebanon , " he said . german government : " israel has a right to defend itself " the german government on friday said israel had the right to defend itself but should think about the long-term impact of its offensive in lebanon . " on the one hand , israel has the internationally recognized right to self defense .
but at the same time we ask our israeli friends and partners not to lose sight of the long-term consequences when they exercise this right , " deputy government spokesman jens plötner said . " here we think care should be taken about the situation in lebanon , which is a fragile entity as a state and could be further destabilised , " he added . plötner said berlin regretted the high number of civilian casualties the fighting has claimed on both sides and called on all parties to " break the spiral of violence . " bildunterschrift : " humanitarian aid difficult to get through " by friday morning the death toll had reached 61 ever since israel began retaliating wednesday for the capture of two israeli soldiers by hezbollah guerrillas in a raid across the southern lebanese border . " movement restrictions are also making it very difficult for humanitarian operators to help the people that most need it .

summit host president vladimir putin urged all sides to " immediately stop military action " and said he would discuss the crisis with us president george w. bush in pre-summit bilateral talks and over the weekend with the other g8 leaders .
" we will do everything we can to ensure peace as quickly as possible in the palestinian territories , israel and lebanon , " putin told a video conference of youths in st petersburg and in cairo . a white house spokesman said the situation was sure to be a " topic of much concern " at the g8 sessions , describing the violence as a " forcing event " that required nations to take sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the putins welcome the bushes in st petersburg bush arrived in putin 's home city for face-to-face talks before the annual summit of the world 's richest club , which also includes britain , canada , france , germany , italy and japan . according to lebanese police , more than 60 civilians have been killed since israel began its offensive two days ago in retaliation for the capture of two soldiers and the killing of eight others by hezbollah . the gaza offensive to retrieve a soldier captured there nearly three weeks ago has so far left at least 76 palestinians and one israeli soldier dead . divided reaction from g8 nations but splits were apparent among g8 countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states - over how to respond to the escalating violence in the middle east . the united states called for restraint from israel , adding that the country had a right to defend itself , while canada urged hezbollah supporters to cut off funding for the organization .
washington separately vetoed a un resolution demanding an end to the military operations in gaza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon russian and european diplomats , however , described the israeli offensive as " disproportionate use of force " against lebanon and the palestinian territories , and putin , as well as other world leaders , called for all sides to " immediately stop military action . " north korean , iranian nuclear debates continue supported by europe and japan , us president george w. bush is also expected to try to persuade russia and china to threaten tough action against north korea after it fired seven missiles . japan proposed a draft un resolution to that effect , but china and russia put forward a second - softer - version .
just how hard the us and japan are willing to push for a resolution remains unclear . leaders will also discuss the iranian nuclear program , which the united states fears is hiding a weapons development program under the guise of civilian atomic work . world powers agreed in paris earlier this week to send their concerns back to the un security council with the implicit threat of sanctions if iran still refuses to suspend uranium enrichment . us officials voiced satisfaction at what was billed as a change of tack by moscow only for russian foreign minister sergei lavrov to say that any talk of sanctions at this stage was " hypothetical . " despite the new issues , the topic of energy security , which has divided russia and europe , is still likely to get some attention at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russia-ukraine gas dispute earlier this year prompted fears in europe moscow raised fears across europe when it briefly cut off gas supplies to the ukraine in january .
europe receives 25 percent of its gas supply from russia via the ukraine , leading some in europe to consider how they should diversify their energy supplies and lower their dependency on russia . critics question russia 's record on democracy with all the discussions regarding political developments in russia , some experts see the primary aim of this g8 summit to provide the rest of the world with an opportunity to see what is actually going on inside of russia . critics argued that the authoritarian style of rule in the country , coupled with strict regulation of non-government organizations and suppression of political opposition parties mean it has not earned the right to become a full g8 member . a number of protesters were arrested when an opposition group , led by chess great gary kasparov , held its own meeting prior to the weekend 's summit to highlight the country 's democratic failures and try to consolidate an opposition to the ruling united russia party . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

the men charged must answer for their role in the 1995 srebrenica massacre of nearly 8,000 muslims . the july 11 , 1995 srebrenica massacre is the only incident in the 1992-95 bosnian war that the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- has ruled was genocide .
to date , six people have been convicted in connection with the atrocities in srebrenica .
two of those were convicted of genocide . however , the two men considered to be ultimately responsible for the massacre - former bosnian serb president radovan karadzic and his military commander , ratko mladic - are still at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radislav krstic during his trial for five of the seven men going on trial friday , the 60-page indictment charges them with genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the defendants are viewed as henchmen of former general radislav krstic , who has already been sentenced to 35 years in prison . standing trial are : ljubisa beara , the chief of security of the main staff of the bosnian serb army ; ljubomir borovcanin , the deputy commander of the bosnian serb special mup police ; vinko pandurevic , the commander of the zvornik brigade that led the attack on srebrenica ; drago nikolic , the chief of security of the zvornik brigade ; and vujadin popovic , an officer allegedly responsible for managing the military police . the two other suspects , radivoje miletic and milan gvero , are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the prosecution said that the two men , both officers attached to the main staff of the bosnian serb army , are responsible for blocking aid and supplies to srebrenica . tragic eve n ts from 1993 , when srebrenica was put under un protection , the enclave was flooded by thousands of muslim refugees driven out of their homes by a bosnian serb offensive .
the town was cut off from the outside world by serb troops , and food and medical supplies were scarce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red flags mark skulls unearthed by war crimes investigators at a mass grave site near srebrenica when the bosnian serbs finally overran the town on july 11 , 1995 , the lightly armed dutch peacekeepers protecting the enclave did not stop the onslaught .
in the days that followed , the bosnian serb troops separated the men from the women and children .
they summarily executed some 8,000 muslim men and boys at several locations around srebrenica . the victims ' bodies were initially buried in a dozen mass graves , but the bosnian serbs moved them later to other locations to cover up the massacre .
so far , forensic experts have found around 60 mass graves around srebrenica . the first day of the trial on friday is devoted to procedural matters .
the prosecution 's actual opening statements are planned for august , after the summer recess . for chief prosecutor carla del ponte , the trial could be the last chance to achieve at least some degree of justice for the victims of the srebrenica massacre .
since the death of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic in his cell at the hague , things have grown quiet at the tribunal .

rates have been set at 0.25 % but not everyone is happy with the decision .
why has japan had zero interest rates ?
japan 's monetary policy of zero interest rates was introduced in march 2001 in an attempt to revive the economy , which had been in long-term recession since the early 1990s .
japan 's consumers are again getting a taste for spending one of the main problems was deflation - falling prices - which meant that consumers and businesses were reluctant to spend or invest because any purchase was likely to be cheaper in the future .
the zero interest rate was designed to make it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow money for spending , and less attractive for them to save .
what is prompting the decision to increase the rate ?
japan has been wrestling with more than a decade of slow growth and recession that has hit companies and consumers alike but now its economy has been gaining momentum .
it grew in each of the past five quarters while unemployment has fallen to an eight-year low of 4 % .
the government recently upgraded its annual growth forecast for the current year to more than 2 % .
there is a feeling that the economy is now strong enough to cope with interest rates going up .
why is this considered a significant step ?
it signals japan 's confidence in the strength of its economy , which has seen accelerating growth and falling unemployment .
it also marks a shift in monetary policy , away from tackling deflation .
is the decision unanimously supported by the japanese government ?
in a word , no .
the decision was made by the bank of japan - an independent body .
there is great nervousness among japanese ministers who are concerned because the last time zero rates were abandoned , in 2000 , this led to a prolonged economic downturn .
finance minister sadakazu tanigaki has said repeatedly that he does not believe the time is right for a rise in rates .
he , like others , is concerned that it could stop the country 's resurgent economy in its tracks .
so what now ?
economists say that another rise is unlikely until october at the earliest - and only if it does not appear to be having negative effects on the economy however , in the past year there have been increasing signs the economy has pulled itself out of its trough .

the zero interest rate was designed to make it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow money for spending , and less attractive for them to save .
what is prompting the decision to increase the rate ?
japan has been wrestling with more than a decade of slow growth and recession that has hit companies and consumers alike but now its economy has been gaining momentum .
it grew in each of the past five quarters while unemployment has fallen to an eight-year low of 4 % .
the government recently upgraded its annual growth forecast for the current year to more than 2 % .
there is a feeling that the economy is now strong enough to cope with interest rates going up .
why is this considered a significant step ?
it signals japan 's confidence in the strength of its economy , which has seen accelerating growth and falling unemployment .
it also marks a shift in monetary policy , away from tackling deflation .
is the decision unanimously supported by the japanese government ?
in a word , no .
the decision was made by the bank of japan - an independent body .
there is great nervousness among japanese ministers who are concerned because the last time zero rates were abandoned , in 2000 , this led to a prolonged economic downturn .
finance minister sadakazu tanigaki has said repeatedly that he does not believe the time is right for a rise in rates .
he , like others , is concerned that it could stop the country 's resurgent economy in its tracks .
so what now ?
economists say that another rise is unlikely until october at the earliest - and only if it does not appear to be having negative effects on the economy however , in the past year there have been increasing signs the economy has pulled itself out of its trough .

excessive drinking is affecting the population 's health as well as causing problems such as anti-social behaviour , according to public health experts .
the national public health service said alcohol misuse was a major cause of cirrhosis of the liver , as well as cancer , mental illness and accidents .
it says higher drink prices and reduced availability can cut drink consumption .
the national public health service for wales collated published figures for its study on the health consequences of alcohol abuse . "
' mediterranean-style ' drinking is no panacea - comparison of different european countries shows that it is associated with high rates of cirrhosis " dr edward coles , nphs for wales the report said alcohol consumption has doubled as the real price of alcohol has fallen over the past 40 years .
it estimates alcohol-related conditions will claim the lives of some 170 men and 90 women in wales during 2006 .
report author dr edward coles said : " excessive alcohol use is a serious public health problem in wales .
health would improve substantially if there was a reduction in the number of people who drink more than the guidelines .
" ' mediterranean-style ' drinking is no panacea .
comparison of different european countries shows that it is associated with high rates of cirrhosis . "
wales has some of the heaviest-drinking teenagers in europe , according to the report , but dr coles said the public image of alcohol abuse tends to focus on any social problems it causes rather than the wide range of illness left in its wake .
he said : " there is a tendency to think of crime and disorder as being the main cause of illness associated with excessive drinking .
" however , cirrhosis of the liver , cancer , mental illness , accidents , unwanted pregnancies and babies damaged by their mothers ' drinking are also important . "
' forgotten drug ' the recommended weekly alcohol limit is 21 units for men , and 14 for women .
dr coles added : " there are two mechanisms that have been shown to produce a substantial reduction in alcohol consumption - increased price and reduced availability .
" the national public health service for wales believe this is an important message for local licensing committees throughout wales . "
the findings were backed by aneurin owen , director of cais , the drug and alcohol agency based in llandudno , which sees about 6,000 people annually , many of whom have alcohol issues .
he said : " we have taken smoking seriously , we are taking drugs somewhat more seriously , alcohol seems to be the forgotten drug in society .
" we see young people with severe alcohol-related conditions like cirrhosis , pancreatitis , depression associated with alcohol , family breakdown , violence .
the list is endless .
" it is hidden for a time in the norm of heavy drinking , until there is a regretful event like violence or risky behaviour , which trips some to start thinking about their drinking . "

but the increasing use of sat-nav systems has led minicab drivers to claim they are almost as efficient .
the knowledge , which normally takes three or four years ' study to attain , involves remembering every street within six miles of charing cross .
while few minicab drivers would challenge the cabbies ' pre-eminence in central london , they say sat-nav has put them on a level playing field outside knowledge territory in the suburbs .
the bbc news website decided to put this claim to the test to see if the guidance system had eroded the knowledge 's superiority .
our examination , by no means scientific , involved hiring two cabs , a black cab with no sat-nav and a minicab with the device .
of the dozen or so trials attended by the ldta , the cabbies have won out on all occasions bob oddy licensed taxi drivers ' association general secretary starting from the bbc london office in marylebone high street , in w1 , we headed to nunhead in se15 - an 8.2-mile trip during the evening rush hour .
driving the black cab was bill , a retired police officer of 30 years , who had only recently passed his knowledge test after only two years ' training .
and in the red citroen minicab was somali-born maya , who has only been covering central london for a month but has installed satellite navigation software in his car .
bill left at 1705 bst and took us through hyde park corner , st james ' park , parliament square , westminster bridge , over the bricklayer 's arms flyover into old kent road turning off into pomeroy street heading into nunhead .
he took a small deviation around nunhead 's victorian cemetery but quickly found his way , reaching the destination in 42 minutes , at 1747 bst .
the trip cost £ 35 .
road works while black cabs are also permitted to use sat-nav to help them on journeys to outer london , bill said he was not convinced the technology would improve the quality of his service .
" sat-nav wo n't tell me if there are road works on such and such a road , or that some routes work better depending on the time of day , " he said .
meanwhile , maya set off at 1800 bst after inputting the destination address into his sat-nav device which estimated the journey time at an optimistic 27 minutes .
minicab driver maya 's sat-nav directed him into a bus depot his route took him through victoria , a congested vauxhall bridge , oval , camberwell green and old kent road heading towards peckham .
but near peckham high street , the sat-nav directed him to turn right a bit too soon , straight into a bus depot .
" how are we going to get out of here then , " he said , letting out a chuckle as though it was not the first time sat-nav had led him astray .
good thing the meter was not running .
he completed the journey in 53 minutes - 11 minutes slower than the gps-challenged bill - but at £ 19 , the fare was £ 16 cheaper .
the result was no surprise to bob oddy , general secretary of the london taxi drivers ' association -lrb- ltda -rrb- , who has been involved in several trials pitting guidance systems against london cabbies .
" of the dozen or so trials attended by the ltda , the cabbies have won out on all occasions , " he said .
' good test ' he added that the obvious flaw with most sat-nav systems was that they failed to recognise that the same route was not necessarily the best choice at different times of the day .
" a good test is to programme a route at 7am and then repeat the process at 7pm , " he told the cabbies newspaper taxi .
but john griffin , founder of minicab firm addison lee , said : " a black cab driver who 's done the knowledge might know 8,000 routes through london but a sat-nav device knows 80,000 and that 's a huge difference .
" minicabs are now in their slipstream and things like satellite navigation , with us both using the same technology , will help us catch up . "
steve wright , chairman of the licensed private hire and car association , said sat-nav was a " great leveller " .
" it brings private-hire cabs closer to the unique service of the black cab , " he said .
" but we do n't see it as replacing the knowledge yet . "

but the increasing use of sat-nav systems has led minicab drivers to claim they are almost as efficient .
the knowledge , which normally takes three or four years ' study to attain , involves remembering every street within six miles of charing cross .
while few minicab drivers would challenge the cabbies ' pre-eminence in central london , they say sat-nav has put them on a level playing field outside knowledge territory in the suburbs .
the bbc news website decided to put this claim to the test to see if the guidance system had eroded the knowledge 's superiority .
our examination , by no means scientific , involved hiring two cabs , a black cab with no sat-nav and a minicab with the device .
of the dozen or so trials attended by the ldta , the cabbies have won out on all occasions bob oddy licensed taxi drivers ' association general secretary starting from the bbc london office in marylebone high street , in w1 , we headed to nunhead in se15 - an 8.2-mile trip during the evening rush hour .
driving the black cab was bill , a retired police officer of 30 years , who had only recently passed his knowledge test after only two years ' training .
and in the red citroen minicab was somali-born maya , who has only been covering central london for a month but has installed satellite navigation software in his car .
bill left at 1705 bst and took us through hyde park corner , st james ' park , parliament square , westminster bridge , over the bricklayer 's arms flyover into old kent road turning off into pomeroy street heading into nunhead .
he took a small deviation around nunhead 's victorian cemetery but quickly found his way , reaching the destination in 42 minutes , at 1747 bst .
the trip cost £ 35 .
road works while black cabs are also permitted to use sat-nav to help them on journeys to outer london , bill said he was not convinced the technology would improve the quality of his service .
" sat-nav wo n't tell me if there are road works on such and such a road , or that some routes work better depending on the time of day , " he said .
meanwhile , maya set off at 1800 bst after inputting the destination address into his sat-nav device which estimated the journey time at an optimistic 27 minutes .
minicab driver maya 's sat-nav directed him into a bus depot his route took him through victoria , a congested vauxhall bridge , oval , camberwell green and old kent road heading towards peckham .
but near peckham high street , the sat-nav directed him to turn right a bit too soon , straight into a bus depot .
" how are we going to get out of here then , " he said , letting out a chuckle as though it was not the first time sat-nav had led him astray .
good thing the meter was not running .
he completed the journey in 53 minutes - 11 minutes slower than the gps-challenged bill - but at £ 19 , the fare was £ 16 cheaper .
the result was no surprise to bob oddy , general secretary of the london taxi drivers ' association -lrb- ltda -rrb- , who has been involved in several trials pitting guidance systems against london cabbies .
" of the dozen or so trials attended by the ltda , the cabbies have won out on all occasions , " he said .
' good test ' he added that the obvious flaw with most sat-nav systems was that they failed to recognise that the same route was not necessarily the best choice at different times of the day .
" a good test is to programme a route at 7am and then repeat the process at 7pm , " he told the cabbies newspaper taxi .

but the increasing use of sat-nav systems has led minicab drivers to claim they are almost as efficient .
the knowledge , which normally takes three or four years ' study to attain , involves remembering every street within six miles of charing cross .
while few minicab drivers would challenge the cabbies ' pre-eminence in central london , they say sat-nav has put them on a level playing field outside knowledge territory in the suburbs .
the bbc news website decided to put this claim to the test to see if the guidance system had eroded the knowledge 's superiority .
our examination , by no means scientific , involved hiring two cabs , a black cab with no sat-nav and a minicab with the device .
of the dozen or so trials attended by the ldta , the cabbies have won out on all occasions bob oddy licensed taxi drivers ' association general secretary starting from the bbc london office in marylebone high street , in w1 , we headed to nunhead in se15 - an 8.2-mile trip during the evening rush hour .
driving the black cab was bill , a retired police officer of 30 years , who had only recently passed his knowledge test after only two years ' training .
and in the red citroen minicab was somali-born maya , who has only been covering central london for a month but has installed satellite navigation software in his car .
bill left at 1705 bst and took us through hyde park corner , st james ' park , parliament square , westminster bridge , over the bricklayer 's arms flyover into old kent road turning off into pomeroy street heading into nunhead .
he took a small deviation around nunhead 's victorian cemetery but quickly found his way , reaching the destination in 42 minutes , at 1747 bst .
the trip cost £ 35 .
road works while black cabs are also permitted to use sat-nav to help them on journeys to outer london , bill said he was not convinced the technology would improve the quality of his service .
" sat-nav wo n't tell me if there are road works on such and such a road , or that some routes work better depending on the time of day , " he said .
meanwhile , maya set off at 1800 bst after inputting the destination address into his sat-nav device which estimated the journey time at an optimistic 27 minutes .
minicab driver maya 's sat-nav directed him into a bus depot his route took him through victoria , a congested vauxhall bridge , oval , camberwell green and old kent road heading towards peckham .
but near peckham high street , the sat-nav directed him to turn right a bit too soon , straight into a bus depot .
" how are we going to get out of here then , " he said , letting out a chuckle as though it was not the first time sat-nav had led him astray .
good thing the meter was not running .
he completed the journey in 53 minutes - 11 minutes slower than the gps-challenged bill - but at £ 19 , the fare was £ 16 cheaper .

" of the dozen or so trials attended by the ltda , the cabbies have won out on all occasions , " he said .
' good test ' he added that the obvious flaw with most sat-nav systems was that they failed to recognise that the same route was not necessarily the best choice at different times of the day .
" a good test is to programme a route at 7am and then repeat the process at 7pm , " he told the cabbies newspaper taxi .
but john griffin , founder of minicab firm addison lee , said : " a black cab driver who 's done the knowledge might know 8,000 routes through london but a sat-nav device knows 80,000 and that 's a huge difference .
" minicabs are now in their slipstream and things like satellite navigation , with us both using the same technology , will help us catch up . "
steve wright , chairman of the licensed private hire and car association , said sat-nav was a " great leveller " .
" it brings private-hire cabs closer to the unique service of the black cab , " he said .
" but we do n't see it as replacing the knowledge yet . "
