" we should have clear , legal , common regulations -lrb- on gmos -rrb- in europe , " austrian agriculture minister josef proell said at the closing press conference , but added , " it is too early to sketch the legal framework for common legislation . " the conference , entitled " freedom of choice , " brought together politicians , scientists , as well as farmers and food producers , to discuss the issue of co-existence , referring to the problems involved in growing both gm and non-gm crops in europe . " we are still at an early stage of development of co-existence rules , we have only limited experience with cultivation of gm crops in europe , " said dirk ahner , the deputy director-general for agriculture and rural development at the european commission , explaining why an exchange of information was needed . more investigations needed before eu is satisfied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more research is needed before laws are passed " to get out the maximum of the limited knowledge we have it is vital that we share information , research and best practice , " he said . proell added that the conference was only the first step and the exchange of information would continue .
another conference on gmo policy is to be held in vienna on april 18-19 . " we 're still far from the end of the road , " he said .
" we need to ... identify together where the problems lie and how they could possibly be addressed , only then can one really think about legislation , " ahner said . politicians at the conference were keen to stress that the issue of co-existence was not about the ethics or safety of gmos but they agreed european farmers had the right to choose whether or not to produce gm crops . risk of contamination without legislation of use without specific legislation however , there is a risk non-gm or organic crops could be contaminated and while the eu says that would have no effect on human health or the environment - gmos can only be grown after they have been authorized by the union - they could have economic consequences for farmers of gm-free crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm foods are n't to everyone 's taste spain is the only eu country to grow gm crops on a commercial scale , although other countries such as the czech republic , france , germany and portugal also cultivate them on a smaller scale . several regions have declared themselves gm-free and specific co-existence legislation exists in denmark , germany , portugal and six austrian provinces but regulations differ throughout the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .

umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "

forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

" union leaders were to press the demand in meetings being held separately with bernard accoyer , parliamentary head of the union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , throughout the day . president jacques chirac , whose government has been torn apart by the scale and handling of the crisis , called on all sides to ensure the talks were " constructive " , according to a spokesman . masses of demonstrators - police said one million and unions said up to three million people - took to the streets tuesday against the law , which makes it easy to fire young workers . the main opposition socialist party issued a separate call for the law to be rescinded before the parliamentary recess . bernard thibault , leader of the main cgt union , said he would not give up until the youth contract was withdrawn in full .
" it 's absolutely not up to us to give up , " he told europe 1 radio . leaders call for protests to intensify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are not rioters , being jobless is our future " student leader bruno julliard called for protests and strikes that have shut down dozens of french universities to " intensify " in the coming days . conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . the measure has sparked nationwide protests , with opponents accusing prime minister dominique de villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and of railroading it through parliament without proper consultation with unions and employers . wednesday 's talks were arranged after chirac offered an elaborate compromise last week - ratifying the measure , then immediately suspending it pending a new law to amend its most contested provisions . emboldened by their protests , leaders of the student-union alliance refuse concessions on the cpe and want all trace of the hated contract written out . the french press was scathing about villepin 's chances of surviving the crisis , which has fractured the government and caused anguished soul-searching about france 's social model . prime minister 's head on the block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin : student enemy number one " what use is villepin ? " the daily parisien headlined .
an opinion poll to be published this week in l 'express magazine shows that 45 percent of the public think villepin should resign . in a sign of a shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , ump chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy . disruption continued wednesday .
hundreds of youths blockaded access to an important wholesale market in the western city of nantes ; others took similar action on key roads in rennes and poitiers , the railway station at chambery in the french alps and a postal sorting centre in toulouse , in the south . violence continues with neither side giving ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students give rail operators a new excuse for delayed service violence erupted in paris and a number of other french cities tuesday when gangs clashed with riot police who responded with tear gas .
the protests were accompanied by strikes , but disruption was limited . laurence parisot , the head of the french medef employers ' association , warned that the latest crisis - coming just months after rioting gripped poor suburbs - was posing a threat to the economy . the image of france has also taken a hit , fuelled by television pictures of scenes of violence .
australia - which had already warned its citizens about november 's suburban rioting - updated its travel advice wednesday to caution against visiting areas where protests could turn violent . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french protests continue after tuesday 's huge demonstrations emboldened by tuesday 's massive demonstrations , french unions are to meet with leaders from president jacques chirac 's ruling right party for talks on wednesday on the contested youth jobs law .

-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- german strikes drag on , french protests escalate " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .

it also stressed that were europe to deviate from the practice , its airlines would be at an international disadvantage . disadvantaged in fact , deutsche bahn brought the case in december 2002 on the grounds it was at a competitive disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trains just ca n't keep up with planes its high-speed links represent immediate competition to air travel , according to db , but are subject to considerably higher tax and therefore massively handicapped . " we have had to cancel high-speed links between cologne and hamburg , for example , because we could n't compete with rival flights , " said a db spokesman . " the ruling at least illustrates that german legislators should show more consideration to the rail company by exempting it from eco-tax , for example , " he said .
db currently pays 380 million euros a year in duties and taxes on energy , of which 180 million is eco-tax and 130 million fuel tax . a blow for sustainable transport " the competitive bias between transport companies has been cemented -lrb- by the judgement -rrb- , " hit out rail lobby " allianz pro schiene " -lrb- alliance for rail -rrb- , insisting the inequality between carriers was now set in stone in favor of the more environmentally damaging mode of transport . " this is a blow for sustainable transport , " said alliance ceo dirk flege .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is less environmentally damaging than planes air travel is growing globally at about 5 % a year , and is proving to be an environmental nightmare .
although passengers pay an airport passenger tax , the lack of tax on aviation fuel allows airlines to be wasteful , fanning ecologists ' concerns that if air travel continues to grow unchecked , it will spell disaster for the planet .
the tax advantages amount to billions worth of subsidies a year , argue aviation industry critics .
" the ball is now in the government 's court , " said flege .
" changing energy policy in favor of rail is up to government . "
transport ministerwolfgang tiefensee was unwilling to comment . airlines , meanwhile , welcomed the ruling . " we consider the judgement a fair one , not least because deutsche bahn receives generous state subsidies , " said a lufthansa spokesperson in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset .

" it is possible because our president loves football , " said mohammad ali dadkan , president of the iranian football federation .
" he often watches the national team 's matches . "
ahmadinejad sparked worldwide controversy when he suggested the holocaust was a myth , prompting calls from several leading german politicians for the islamic republic to be banned from the finals .
ali dadkan , who was visiting the nuremberg stadium where iran will play their opening match against mexico on june 11 , said fears of terrorist attacks or political demonstrations due to iran 's participation at the world cup were way off the mark .
" i can not see the danger of terrorist attacks or political riots , " said dadkan .
" the iranians who come will all be peaceful football fans . "
dadkan revealed 10 percent of the 8,413 world cup tickets allocated to iran had been sold but said he expected around 4,000 supporters for the mexico match .
" we expect people from various parts of the world to come to the game , " he added .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .

as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .

" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .

as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .
they 've been looking forward to a chat with him for quite a long time . jan oltmanns -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian election campaigns turn cut-throat italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .
when angela merkel visited rome on monday , the signs hinted at a new start in relations between germany and italy .

12 , 2005 -rrb- italian senate votes to overhaul constitution italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .
" it 's therefore shocking that the governing coalition is planning to cut one-third of its integration budget .

it also stressed that were europe to deviate from the practice , its airlines would be at an international disadvantage . disadvantaged in fact , deutsche bahn brought the case in december 2002 on the grounds it was at a competitive disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trains just ca n't keep up with planes its high-speed links represent immediate competition to air travel , according to db , but are subject to considerably higher tax and therefore massively handicapped . " we have had to cancel high-speed links between cologne and hamburg , for example , because we could n't compete with rival flights , " said a db spokesman . " the ruling at least illustrates that german legislators should show more consideration to the rail company by exempting it from eco-tax , for example , " he said .
db currently pays 380 million euros a year in duties and taxes on energy , of which 180 million is eco-tax and 130 million fuel tax . a blow for sustainable transport " the competitive bias between transport companies has been cemented -lrb- by the judgement -rrb- , " hit out rail lobby " allianz pro schiene " -lrb- alliance for rail -rrb- , insisting the inequality between carriers was now set in stone in favor of the more environmentally damaging mode of transport . " this is a blow for sustainable transport , " said alliance ceo dirk flege .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is less environmentally damaging than planes air travel is growing globally at about 5 % a year , and is proving to be an environmental nightmare .
although passengers pay an airport passenger tax , the lack of tax on aviation fuel allows airlines to be wasteful , fanning ecologists ' concerns that if air travel continues to grow unchecked , it will spell disaster for the planet .
the tax advantages amount to billions worth of subsidies a year , argue aviation industry critics .
" the ball is now in the government 's court , " said flege .
" changing energy policy in favor of rail is up to government . "
transport ministerwolfgang tiefensee was unwilling to comment . airlines , meanwhile , welcomed the ruling . " we consider the judgement a fair one , not least because deutsche bahn receives generous state subsidies , " said a lufthansa spokesperson in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .

as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .

umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .

italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .

he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .

according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .
they 've been looking forward to a chat with him for quite a long time . jan oltmanns -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian election campaigns turn cut-throat italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .
prime minister silvio berlusconi is trailing and is now turning to the far right in a bid to shore up support .
-lrb- april 4 , 2006 -rrb- out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio gerhard schröder 's time in office is something silvio berlusconi would like to forget .

it also stressed that were europe to deviate from the practice , its airlines would be at an international disadvantage . disadvantaged in fact , deutsche bahn brought the case in december 2002 on the grounds it was at a competitive disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trains just ca n't keep up with planes its high-speed links represent immediate competition to air travel , according to db , but are subject to considerably higher tax and therefore massively handicapped . " we have had to cancel high-speed links between cologne and hamburg , for example , because we could n't compete with rival flights , " said a db spokesman . " the ruling at least illustrates that german legislators should show more consideration to the rail company by exempting it from eco-tax , for example , " he said .
db currently pays 380 million euros a year in duties and taxes on energy , of which 180 million is eco-tax and 130 million fuel tax . a blow for sustainable transport " the competitive bias between transport companies has been cemented -lrb- by the judgement -rrb- , " hit out rail lobby " allianz pro schiene " -lrb- alliance for rail -rrb- , insisting the inequality between carriers was now set in stone in favor of the more environmentally damaging mode of transport . " this is a blow for sustainable transport , " said alliance ceo dirk flege .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is less environmentally damaging than planes air travel is growing globally at about 5 % a year , and is proving to be an environmental nightmare .
although passengers pay an airport passenger tax , the lack of tax on aviation fuel allows airlines to be wasteful , fanning ecologists ' concerns that if air travel continues to grow unchecked , it will spell disaster for the planet .
the tax advantages amount to billions worth of subsidies a year , argue aviation industry critics .
" the ball is now in the government 's court , " said flege .
" changing energy policy in favor of rail is up to government . "
transport ministerwolfgang tiefensee was unwilling to comment . airlines , meanwhile , welcomed the ruling .

" we should have clear , legal , common regulations -lrb- on gmos -rrb- in europe , " austrian agriculture minister josef proell said at the closing press conference , but added , " it is too early to sketch the legal framework for common legislation . " the conference , entitled " freedom of choice , " brought together politicians , scientists , as well as farmers and food producers , to discuss the issue of co-existence , referring to the problems involved in growing both gm and non-gm crops in europe . " we are still at an early stage of development of co-existence rules , we have only limited experience with cultivation of gm crops in europe , " said dirk ahner , the deputy director-general for agriculture and rural development at the european commission , explaining why an exchange of information was needed . more investigations needed before eu is satisfied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more research is needed before laws are passed " to get out the maximum of the limited knowledge we have it is vital that we share information , research and best practice , " he said . proell added that the conference was only the first step and the exchange of information would continue .
another conference on gmo policy is to be held in vienna on april 18-19 . " we 're still far from the end of the road , " he said .
" we need to ... identify together where the problems lie and how they could possibly be addressed , only then can one really think about legislation , " ahner said . politicians at the conference were keen to stress that the issue of co-existence was not about the ethics or safety of gmos but they agreed european farmers had the right to choose whether or not to produce gm crops . risk of contamination without legislation of use without specific legislation however , there is a risk non-gm or organic crops could be contaminated and while the eu says that would have no effect on human health or the environment - gmos can only be grown after they have been authorized by the union - they could have economic consequences for farmers of gm-free crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm foods are n't to everyone 's taste spain is the only eu country to grow gm crops on a commercial scale , although other countries such as the czech republic , france , germany and portugal also cultivate them on a smaller scale . several regions have declared themselves gm-free and specific co-existence legislation exists in denmark , germany , portugal and six austrian provinces but regulations differ throughout the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .
" it 's therefore shocking that the governing coalition is planning to cut one-third of its integration budget .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .

umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

" it is possible because our president loves football , " said mohammad ali dadkan , president of the iranian football federation .
" he often watches the national team 's matches . "
ahmadinejad sparked worldwide controversy when he suggested the holocaust was a myth , prompting calls from several leading german politicians for the islamic republic to be banned from the finals .
ali dadkan , who was visiting the nuremberg stadium where iran will play their opening match against mexico on june 11 , said fears of terrorist attacks or political demonstrations due to iran 's participation at the world cup were way off the mark .
" i can not see the danger of terrorist attacks or political riots , " said dadkan .
" the iranians who come will all be peaceful football fans . "
dadkan revealed 10 percent of the 8,413 world cup tickets allocated to iran had been sold but said he expected around 4,000 supporters for the mexico match .
" we expect people from various parts of the world to come to the game , " he added .

" union leaders were to press the demand in meetings being held separately with bernard accoyer , parliamentary head of the union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , throughout the day . president jacques chirac , whose government has been torn apart by the scale and handling of the crisis , called on all sides to ensure the talks were " constructive " , according to a spokesman . masses of demonstrators - police said one million and unions said up to three million people - took to the streets tuesday against the law , which makes it easy to fire young workers . the main opposition socialist party issued a separate call for the law to be rescinded before the parliamentary recess . bernard thibault , leader of the main cgt union , said he would not give up until the youth contract was withdrawn in full .
" it 's absolutely not up to us to give up , " he told europe 1 radio . leaders call for protests to intensify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are not rioters , being jobless is our future " student leader bruno julliard called for protests and strikes that have shut down dozens of french universities to " intensify " in the coming days . conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . the measure has sparked nationwide protests , with opponents accusing prime minister dominique de villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and of railroading it through parliament without proper consultation with unions and employers . wednesday 's talks were arranged after chirac offered an elaborate compromise last week - ratifying the measure , then immediately suspending it pending a new law to amend its most contested provisions . emboldened by their protests , leaders of the student-union alliance refuse concessions on the cpe and want all trace of the hated contract written out . the french press was scathing about villepin 's chances of surviving the crisis , which has fractured the government and caused anguished soul-searching about france 's social model . prime minister 's head on the block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin : student enemy number one " what use is villepin ? " the daily parisien headlined .
an opinion poll to be published this week in l 'express magazine shows that 45 percent of the public think villepin should resign . in a sign of a shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , ump chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy . disruption continued wednesday .
hundreds of youths blockaded access to an important wholesale market in the western city of nantes ; others took similar action on key roads in rennes and poitiers , the railway station at chambery in the french alps and a postal sorting centre in toulouse , in the south . violence continues with neither side giving ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students give rail operators a new excuse for delayed service violence erupted in paris and a number of other french cities tuesday when gangs clashed with riot police who responded with tear gas .
the protests were accompanied by strikes , but disruption was limited . laurence parisot , the head of the french medef employers ' association , warned that the latest crisis - coming just months after rioting gripped poor suburbs - was posing a threat to the economy . the image of france has also taken a hit , fuelled by television pictures of scenes of violence .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .

those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .
" it 's therefore shocking that the governing coalition is planning to cut one-third of its integration budget .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

" we should have clear , legal , common regulations -lrb- on gmos -rrb- in europe , " austrian agriculture minister josef proell said at the closing press conference , but added , " it is too early to sketch the legal framework for common legislation . " the conference , entitled " freedom of choice , " brought together politicians , scientists , as well as farmers and food producers , to discuss the issue of co-existence , referring to the problems involved in growing both gm and non-gm crops in europe . " we are still at an early stage of development of co-existence rules , we have only limited experience with cultivation of gm crops in europe , " said dirk ahner , the deputy director-general for agriculture and rural development at the european commission , explaining why an exchange of information was needed . more investigations needed before eu is satisfied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more research is needed before laws are passed " to get out the maximum of the limited knowledge we have it is vital that we share information , research and best practice , " he said . proell added that the conference was only the first step and the exchange of information would continue .
another conference on gmo policy is to be held in vienna on april 18-19 . " we 're still far from the end of the road , " he said .
" we need to ... identify together where the problems lie and how they could possibly be addressed , only then can one really think about legislation , " ahner said . politicians at the conference were keen to stress that the issue of co-existence was not about the ethics or safety of gmos but they agreed european farmers had the right to choose whether or not to produce gm crops . risk of contamination without legislation of use without specific legislation however , there is a risk non-gm or organic crops could be contaminated and while the eu says that would have no effect on human health or the environment - gmos can only be grown after they have been authorized by the union - they could have economic consequences for farmers of gm-free crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm foods are n't to everyone 's taste spain is the only eu country to grow gm crops on a commercial scale , although other countries such as the czech republic , france , germany and portugal also cultivate them on a smaller scale . several regions have declared themselves gm-free and specific co-existence legislation exists in denmark , germany , portugal and six austrian provinces but regulations differ throughout the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italian election campaigns turn cut-throat out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .
" it 's therefore shocking that the governing coalition is planning to cut one-third of its integration budget .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .

" i can not see the danger of terrorist attacks or political riots , " said dadkan .
" the iranians who come will all be peaceful football fans . "
dadkan revealed 10 percent of the 8,413 world cup tickets allocated to iran had been sold but said he expected around 4,000 supporters for the mexico match .
" we expect people from various parts of the world to come to the game , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.04.2006 court gives airlines a break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air travel is partially to blame for global warming gloom merchants have long predicted it 's only a matter of time before the low-cost air travel bubble bursts , but it got a boost wednesday when the european court of justice ruled that aviation fuel will remain tax-free . like most people in europe these days , it seems the european court of justice just ca n't say no to cheap flights . in a case brought by german rail , deutsche bahn , the european court of justice has ruled that aviation fuel may remain tax-free . the court decided that aviation fuel 's tax-free status did not amount to illegal state aid , as deutsche bahn had alleged , but pointed to the fact that it is an accepted international norm .
it also stressed that were europe to deviate from the practice , its airlines would be at an international disadvantage . disadvantaged in fact , deutsche bahn brought the case in december 2002 on the grounds it was at a competitive disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trains just ca n't keep up with planes its high-speed links represent immediate competition to air travel , according to db , but are subject to considerably higher tax and therefore massively handicapped . " we have had to cancel high-speed links between cologne and hamburg , for example , because we could n't compete with rival flights , " said a db spokesman . " the ruling at least illustrates that german legislators should show more consideration to the rail company by exempting it from eco-tax , for example , " he said .
db currently pays 380 million euros a year in duties and taxes on energy , of which 180 million is eco-tax and 130 million fuel tax . a blow for sustainable transport " the competitive bias between transport companies has been cemented -lrb- by the judgement -rrb- , " hit out rail lobby " allianz pro schiene " -lrb- alliance for rail -rrb- , insisting the inequality between carriers was now set in stone in favor of the more environmentally damaging mode of transport . " this is a blow for sustainable transport , " said alliance ceo dirk flege .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train travel is less environmentally damaging than planes air travel is growing globally at about 5 % a year , and is proving to be an environmental nightmare .
although passengers pay an airport passenger tax , the lack of tax on aviation fuel allows airlines to be wasteful , fanning ecologists ' concerns that if air travel continues to grow unchecked , it will spell disaster for the planet .
the tax advantages amount to billions worth of subsidies a year , argue aviation industry critics .
" the ball is now in the government 's court , " said flege .
" changing energy policy in favor of rail is up to government . "
transport ministerwolfgang tiefensee was unwilling to comment . airlines , meanwhile , welcomed the ruling . " we consider the judgement a fair one , not least because deutsche bahn receives generous state subsidies , " said a lufthansa spokesperson in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.04.2006 integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence has captured public attention as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .
bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .

ahmadinejad sparked worldwide controversy when he suggested the holocaust was a myth , prompting calls from several leading german politicians for the islamic republic to be banned from the finals .
ali dadkan , who was visiting the nuremberg stadium where iran will play their opening match against mexico on june 11 , said fears of terrorist attacks or political demonstrations due to iran 's participation at the world cup were way off the mark .
" i can not see the danger of terrorist attacks or political riots , " said dadkan .
" the iranians who come will all be peaceful football fans . "
dadkan revealed 10 percent of the 8,413 world cup tickets allocated to iran had been sold but said he expected around 4,000 supporters for the mexico match .

" union leaders were to press the demand in meetings being held separately with bernard accoyer , parliamentary head of the union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- , throughout the day . president jacques chirac , whose government has been torn apart by the scale and handling of the crisis , called on all sides to ensure the talks were " constructive " , according to a spokesman . masses of demonstrators - police said one million and unions said up to three million people - took to the streets tuesday against the law , which makes it easy to fire young workers . the main opposition socialist party issued a separate call for the law to be rescinded before the parliamentary recess . bernard thibault , leader of the main cgt union , said he would not give up until the youth contract was withdrawn in full .
" it 's absolutely not up to us to give up , " he told europe 1 radio . leaders call for protests to intensify bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are not rioters , being jobless is our future " student leader bruno julliard called for protests and strikes that have shut down dozens of french universities to " intensify " in the coming days . conceived as a tool against youth unemployment which runs at 22 percent in france , the cpe is a contract for under 26-year-olds that can be terminated by the employer without explanation during a two-year trial period . the measure has sparked nationwide protests , with opponents accusing prime minister dominique de villepin of trampling on hard-won labor rights and of railroading it through parliament without proper consultation with unions and employers . wednesday 's talks were arranged after chirac offered an elaborate compromise last week - ratifying the measure , then immediately suspending it pending a new law to amend its most contested provisions . emboldened by their protests , leaders of the student-union alliance refuse concessions on the cpe and want all trace of the hated contract written out . the french press was scathing about villepin 's chances of surviving the crisis , which has fractured the government and caused anguished soul-searching about france 's social model . prime minister 's head on the block bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin : student enemy number one " what use is villepin ? " the daily parisien headlined .
an opinion poll to be published this week in l 'express magazine shows that 45 percent of the public think villepin should resign . in a sign of a shifting balance of power in the government , responsibility for organizing the new legislation was taken from villepin and handed to his powerful rival , ump chief and interior minister nicolas sarkozy . disruption continued wednesday .
hundreds of youths blockaded access to an important wholesale market in the western city of nantes ; others took similar action on key roads in rennes and poitiers , the railway station at chambery in the french alps and a postal sorting centre in toulouse , in the south . violence continues with neither side giving ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students give rail operators a new excuse for delayed service violence erupted in paris and a number of other french cities tuesday when gangs clashed with riot police who responded with tear gas .
the protests were accompanied by strikes , but disruption was limited . laurence parisot , the head of the french medef employers ' association , warned that the latest crisis - coming just months after rioting gripped poor suburbs - was posing a threat to the economy . the image of france has also taken a hit , fuelled by television pictures of scenes of violence .
australia - which had already warned its citizens about november 's suburban rioting - updated its travel advice wednesday to caution against visiting areas where protests could turn violent . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french protests continue after tuesday 's huge demonstrations emboldened by tuesday 's massive demonstrations , french unions are to meet with leaders from president jacques chirac 's ruling right party for talks on wednesday on the contested youth jobs law .

" we are still at an early stage of development of co-existence rules , we have only limited experience with cultivation of gm crops in europe , " said dirk ahner , the deputy director-general for agriculture and rural development at the european commission , explaining why an exchange of information was needed . more investigations needed before eu is satisfied bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more research is needed before laws are passed " to get out the maximum of the limited knowledge we have it is vital that we share information , research and best practice , " he said . proell added that the conference was only the first step and the exchange of information would continue .
another conference on gmo policy is to be held in vienna on april 18-19 . " we 're still far from the end of the road , " he said .
" we need to ... identify together where the problems lie and how they could possibly be addressed , only then can one really think about legislation , " ahner said . politicians at the conference were keen to stress that the issue of co-existence was not about the ethics or safety of gmos but they agreed european farmers had the right to choose whether or not to produce gm crops . risk of contamination without legislation of use without specific legislation however , there is a risk non-gm or organic crops could be contaminated and while the eu says that would have no effect on human health or the environment - gmos can only be grown after they have been authorized by the union - they could have economic consequences for farmers of gm-free crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm foods are n't to everyone 's taste spain is the only eu country to grow gm crops on a commercial scale , although other countries such as the czech republic , france , germany and portugal also cultivate them on a smaller scale . several regions have declared themselves gm-free and specific co-existence legislation exists in denmark , germany , portugal and six austrian provinces but regulations differ throughout the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.04.2006 integration strategy demands words against sticks and stones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juvenile violence has captured public attention as germany wonders why its teenagers have become such hoodlums , the government has announced a " national plan of action " to counter violence in schools .
bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?
those who fail will spend 160 hours of their last kindergarten year taking german classes , and children who fail the test a second time round will be refused entry to elementary school and sent to special needs schools . the test will be obligatory for foreign children , with parents facing a financial penalty if they fail to register their children for the exam or the extra classes . bavarian premier edmund stoiber denied the plan was linked to events in berlin and said it had been in development for some time .
the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .
" but these tests are first and foremost in the interests of the children and their families . " not enough educational experts agree the tests serve a purpose , but say improving language skills should be just one strand of a more ambitious approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is desperate to improve integration " everyone at school needs to stick to certain rules and in that respect , demanding a certain level of language skills is a reasonable request , " said michael strohschein from lower saxony 's association for education and economics in an interview with tagesschau tv news program .
" but the problems run deeper , what with poverty , aggression and cultural differences .
schools and social workers need to cooperate closely in tackling these problems and that costs money . " in the bundestag , green party parliamentary group leader volker beck had a similar take on the testing scheme - and also stressed that change wo n't come for free . " language tests for school starters are not enough , " he said .
" it 's therefore shocking that the governing coalition is planning to cut one-third of its integration budget .

in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .

according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .

prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .

in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .

he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .

according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .

italian senate votes to overhaul constitution europe -pipe- 06.04.2006 the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi knows that the fall from power may hit him hard italy 's self-aggrandizing prime minister and law-twisting media mogul silvio berlusconi has every reason to be worried about the upcoming italian elections : if he looses , his dolce vita may be over sooner than he hoped . nobody in europe seems to be taking silvio berlusconi seriously enough , probably because the italian prime minister usually makes the international headlines for rather curious reasons . it would be unthinkable in germany , for example , to hear former defense minister peter struck extolling the virtues of his new hair transplant , vice chancellor franz müntefering making a public vow of chastity to prepare for the next elections , or chancellor angela merkel declaring herself to be the female messiah of german politics .
in italy , however , thanks to silvio berlusconi , such preposterous events have become a matter of daily routine . and although one can not help being amused by it , the berlusconi show is actually no laughing matter .
with his bizarre talent for self-presentation , berlusconi has so far been extremely successful .
the always tanned media mogul with a shark 's grin , who describes himself as an " embodiment of the italian dream , " has been in office longer than any italian prime minister before him - except for fascist wartime dictator benito mussolini .
his estimated assets of $ 11 billion -lrb- 9.1 billion euros -rrb- also make him italy 's richest man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election campaign has been accompanied by demonstrations since 2001 , berlusconi has been accumulating more and more power .
state prosecutors who 'd like to talk to him about his allegedly illegal business practices have been helpless against his political immunity .
in the last 10 years , berlusconi has had charges pressed against him in more than a dozen cases , but he has consistently managed to escape justice through delays , appeals or laws that protect him .
italians call it lex berlusconi . the power of the italian prime minister is based on a leadership style which he himself describes as economic .
he calls himself the " ceo of a company called italy . "
while in office , berlusconi has kept widening the competences of the prime minister .
he also gradually took over almost the entire italian television market .
he owns the influential mediaset tv company , but his arms stretch all the way to the top floors of the state broadcasting company rai , whose board and editorial staff are filled with his minions . berlusconi , the superstar berlusconi controls around 90 percent of public media in italy today , which is why italians - in between afternoon talk shows , soccer matches and soap operas - get to see a lot of him on their tv sets .
he is often portrayed as a personal friend of us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin , the italian " messiah , " the man whose glance makes women melt with pleasure , as well as a soccer patron .
-lrb- he does own top italian club ac milan . -rrb- ahead of the national elections , scheduled for april 9-10 , he has been celebrating himself for weeks in newspapers , on tv and the radio as a statesman , womanizer , entrepreneur and clown par excellence .
the prime minister is indeed a genius at selling himself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : umberto eco is one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics his power over the media and his presence in them has set off a " silent cultural revolution , " according to berlusconi expert alexander stille .
umberto eco , world-famous author and one of berlusconi 's sharpest critics , has spoken of a tv regime , mass-media populism and a system that teaches italians to believe what they see on television . italy placed 77th - together with mongolia - in the list of global press freedom rankings for the year 2005 .
according to us-based watchdog organization freedom house , which compiled the rankings , the press in italy is only " partially free . " in pre-election polls , berlusconi 's challenger and former european commission president romano prodi has been slightly ahead of the incumbent .
prodi won a recent tv duel precisely because berlusconi could not charm the audience within the strict rules of televised debates .
his opponents can now smell the scent of fresh air . observers of italian politics have described the otherwise self-confident prime minister as becoming arrantly insecure .
in the beginning of march , berlusconi even lost his composure in public .
he stormed out of a live talk show because he did n't like the questions . poor government record bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friends : silvio berlusconi and george w. bush berlusconi and his conservative party forza italia are betting their entire election campaign on the personality of the prime minister mostly because his government has very little to show as its accomplishments .
" what have you done in these five years other than create laws that protect your own interests ? "
prodi asked during the tv duel .
during berlusconi 's term , the conjuncture of europe 's fourth largest economy has deteriorated from a 1.8 percent growth rate in 2001 to 0 percent today . the controversial judiciary reform of 2005 , which the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung described as the " victory of the hoodlums , " does n't exactly carry much weight .
legal proceedings in italy drag on forever .
in terms of legal efficiency , italy is today on the same level as guatemala . the times of dolce vita are probably over , even though berlusconi does not want to admit it to himself .
not long ago , he said that during his term in office he had brought italy to the highest international level and that he was " greater than napoleon . "
some voters would beg to differ . fishing on the right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " il duce " was her grandfather , and now berlusconi likes her : alessandra mussolini since the voters seem to be distancing themselves from their once beloved prime minister , another unpleasant chapter is being added to the history of silvio berlusconi : the prime ministers is fishing for votes on the far right .
forza italia is already in alliance with the post-fascist national alliance and the northern league , but quite a few eyebrows were raised when the berlusconi recently brought the neo-fascist alternative alliance on board .
the president of the alternative alliance is alessandra mussolini , grand-daughter of the italian dictator and an unapologetic proponent of right-wing extremism . according to public opinion experts , rubbing shoulders with fascists may bring one or two percent points to berlusconi .
it 's also possible that the association with the radical right is an act of despair , because berlusconi knows for a fact that nobody will be there to protect him if he loses the elections .
if he does lose , he 'll face a series of tete-a-tetes with the antitrust authorities as well as state prosecutors .
they 've been looking forward to a chat with him for quite a long time . jan oltmanns -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian election campaigns turn cut-throat italy is seeing a revival of vicious electioneering ahead of a general election held on april 9 and 10 .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .

the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

the leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister-party , the conservative csu , he said the tests were a way of penalizing those who fail to pull their weight in the process of integration . " it 's not up to us to adapt to the customs of our guests , it 's up to them to adapt to us , " he stressed .

bavaria is already one step ahead of the game . is it because immigrant children are alienated from society ; is it because germany has a system of academically segregated schooling - or is just the rotten core of contemporary life ?
either way , the country 's politicians are falling over themselves to find a quick-fix solution to the problems highlighted by the rütli high school in berlin , where police were recently called in to monitor what teachers described as out-of-control violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-school kids who fail the test will have to take german classes " the time when we could look away and shrug our shoulders is over , " warned maria böhmer , the government 's integration commissioner . speaking in the bundestag , she stressed that the first priority needs to be giving young people better prospects and announced a national initiative to boost better integration and increase young immigrants ' chances on the job market . with members of the green party dismissing the initiative as a mere " placebo , " parliamentarians present at wednesday 's debate failed to reach agreement on whether the roots of juvenile delinquency amongst immigrants are failed integration or failed education policies . so much for the causes .
as for the solutions , they ranged from deporting young offenders to slashing their family benefits .
the one proposal that met with broad agreement was to focus on improving immigrants ' language skills , starting at kindergarten level . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary party chief of the free market liberal fdp party , argued that only children with adequate german should be admitted to school . compulsory language testing the plan is already underway in bavaria , which revealed earlier this week that it intends to introduce language tests for immigrant children one year before they start school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students with adequate german skills : less likely to be unruly ?

euro mp caroline jackson has attacked the quality of life review group , headed by ex-cabinet minister john gummer , which is briefed to develop new ideas to fulfil david cameron 's promise of putting sustainability at the heart of conservative policy . "
i 'm told by scientists who know that sunspot change on the sun could do far more -lsb- damage -rsb- than humankind " john redwood she says she suspects the group 's purpose is partly " cosmetic " and that the party 's environmental agenda will be subverted by mr cameron 's policy on europe .
but a spokesman for the conservative party said : " the quality of life review is one of the six major policy reviews set up by david cameron and reflects our belief that the environment has for too long been treated by politicians as an afterthought .
" that has to change , and our commitment to tackling climate change and preserving and enhancing our quality of life will be fundamental to the policies that we put forward at the next election . "
in an interview for bbc radio 4 's analysis programme , dr jackson also questioned the party 's commitment to environmentalism .
" i think from the point of view of the conservative party pursuing the green line is all talk and no action at the moment , " she told the programme .
" it 's part of the current process in the conservative party of giving green issues prominence and taking up some pretty strange positions on some things i think .
" when push comes to shove in the general election i suspect we will roll back from some of this . "
the programme also uncovered deep divisions over the science of climate change .
peter ainsworth , the shadow environment secretary , described global warming as " the biggest threat we face . "
he said he agreed with sir david king , the government 's chief scientific advisor , that climate change was a bigger danger than terrorism , adding that global warming " has killed more people already than international terrorism . "
this contrasted sharply with the views of john redwood , who is leading the party 's review into competitiveness .
he said it was n't clear that human activity was changing the climate .
" there 's quite a good literature which says that if you have a sudden outbreak of massive volcanic activity it would completely swamp anything mankind was doing , " he said .
" i 'm told by scientists who know that sunspot change on the sun could do far more than humankind .
so there are all these uncertainties . "
curbing influence ?
environmental campaigners told the programme the conservatives would have to resolve these tensions if they wanted convincing green credentials .
" i think the conservative party face a challenge which could be as significant as the debate they 've had internally over europe , " said andrew simms of the new economics foundation .
he said the party was split between a conservationist camp and a free market camp .
" those camps are actually on either side of a very big river , " mr simms said .
and if david cameron tries to sleep in both , " he 's going to get wet , " he added .
meanwhile dr jackson criticised the tory leader 's plan to withdraw the party 's meps from their alliance with the centre-right european people 's party , the largest group in the european parliament .
dr jackson , who chaired the european parliament 's environment committee for five years , says this will leave tory meps powerless .
she asked how far the review group will be able to operate " without being able to get in touch with the people who are actually pulling the strings in europe . "
" if you are threatening to leave the largest political group in europe , whose members have the chance of influencing european environmental legislation in a major way then it is a disaster that you ca n't go and talk to them . "
analysis will be broadcast at 2030 bst on 6 april and repeated at 2130 bst on 9 april on bbc radio 4 .

euro mp caroline jackson has attacked the quality of life review group , headed by ex-cabinet minister john gummer , which is briefed to develop new ideas to fulfil david cameron 's promise of putting sustainability at the heart of conservative policy .
i 'm told by scientists who know that sunspot change on the sun could do far more -lsb- damage -rsb- than humankind john redwood she says she suspects the group 's purpose is partly " cosmetic " and that the party 's environmental agenda will be subverted by mr cameron 's policy on europe .
but a spokesman for the conservative party said : " the quality of life review is one of the six major policy reviews set up by david cameron and reflects our belief that the environment has for too long been treated by politicians as an afterthought .
" that has to change , and our commitment to tackling climate change and preserving and enhancing our quality of life will be fundamental to the policies that we put forward at the next election . "
in an interview for bbc radio 4 's analysis programme , dr jackson also questioned the party 's commitment to environmentalism .
" i think from the point of view of the conservative party pursuing the green line is all talk and no action at the moment , " she told the programme .
" it 's part of the current process in the conservative party of giving green issues prominence and taking up some pretty strange positions on some things i think .
" when push comes to shove in the general election i suspect we will roll back from some of this . "
the programme also uncovered deep divisions over the science of climate change .
peter ainsworth , the shadow environment secretary , described global warming as " the biggest threat we face . "
a central theme of mr cameron 's thinking is under fire he said he agreed with sir david king , the government 's chief scientific advisor , that climate change was a bigger danger than terrorism , adding that global warming " has killed more people already than international terrorism . "
this contrasted sharply with the views of john redwood , who is leading the party 's review into competitiveness .
he said it was n't clear that human activity was changing the climate .
" there 's quite a good literature which says that if you have a sudden outbreak of massive volcanic activity it would completely swamp anything mankind was doing , " he said .
" i 'm told by scientists who know that sunspot change on the sun could do far more than humankind .
so there are all these uncertainties . "
curbing influence ?
environmental campaigners told the programme the conservatives would have to resolve these tensions if they wanted convincing green credentials .
" i think the conservative party face a challenge which could be as significant as the debate they 've had internally over europe , " said andrew simms of the new economics foundation .
he said the party was split between a conservationist camp and a free market camp .
" those camps are actually on either side of a very big river , " mr simms said .
and if david cameron tries to sleep in both , " he 's going to get wet , " he added .
meanwhile dr jackson criticised the tory leader 's plan to withdraw the party 's meps from their alliance with the centre-right european people 's party , the largest group in the european parliament .
dr jackson , who chaired the european parliament 's environment committee for five years , says this will leave tory meps powerless .
she asked how far the review group will be able to operate " without being able to get in touch with the people who are actually pulling the strings in europe . "
" if you are threatening to leave the largest political group in europe , whose members have the chance of influencing european environmental legislation in a major way then it is a disaster that you ca n't go and talk to them . "
analysis will be broadcast at 2030 bst on 6 april and repeated at 2130 bst on 9 april on bbc radio 4 .

the border with kenya runs through its centre .
guards on the ethiopian side are relaxed , chewing leaves of the mild stimulant khat .
2 of 11 the region is at the heart of the food crisis after two failed rains in a row .
kenyans come to ethiopia to buy food - but use other crossing points like this stream on the border .
3 of 11 during a drought , women face the tough choice of deciding whether to feed their children or cattle .
the local borena people will go without food for their children .
4 of 11 the drought has led to many people losing their cattle and with it any wealth they had .
once cattle get weak , their milk dries up leaving people to go hungry .
5 of 11 weak cattle also means their prices plummet .
camels are more drought resistant than cattle and sheep and goats but most herders have lost some camels .
6 of 11 these boys drag the carcass of a cow away from the houses , in case of disease .
after strong rains come it can take some three months for the land to be productive .
7 of 11 khat is widespread here , as is conflict - often started by pastoralists high on the drug .
many farmers in the fertile highlands are growing less coffee for the more lucrative khat .
8 of 11 new grass can kill cattle so hay is transported miles by road from more fertile areas and then carried by foot .
a bundle measuring 50cm by 50cm by 1m is sold for about 40 birr -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- .
9 of 11 tari bonja -lrb- r -rrb- sits next to his wife elema in nearby village of bokola .
in the span of 24 hours , he lost 25 cattle after they grazed on grass .
10 of 11 weakened by rain , their bodies could not digest it and one by one , they fell to the ground and perished .
it was the worst day of tari 's life .
" i would rather have died myself , " he said .
11 of 11 the arrival of rain is celebrated , but an end of hard times is months away .
some are benefiting from an oxfam-backed pond project .
empty just a week ago it is now overflowing .

just this week , the seasonal rains have begun after two failed rains in a row .
more than one in three people in this barren area - known as the triangle of conflict because of its proximity to the kenyan and somali borders - needs food aid and many have lost their cattle and with it any wealth they had .
the bbc news website is inviting readers around the world to put their questions to local people as they come to terms with how sustainable their lifestyles are and what their futures may hold .
they will be answering your questions throughout the day on thursday 6 april via a live laptop link-up .
click here to read your questions to the moyale community click on the links below to read more about the villagers .
aden duba , 48 , pastoralist aden duba is worried that their traditional lifestyle is not sustainable any more .
he supports eight children , two wives and another seven members of his extended family .
he says he is left with very little after having lost 21 cattle , nine goats and two camels and is worried that those left will die , despite the rainy season finally arriving .
" i live in moyale and my cattle are in the country 30kms -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- away .
even now they may be dead because of the rain .
" there is little food assistance and this is a big problem - almost everyone needs help . "
he says he is worried that if things continue like this those who lose all their animals might not live in peace .
" we are starting to sense that pastoralism is not sustainable as a livelihood anymore . "
the 48-year-old says that because of this they want their children to be educated and have more opportunities and a different life but in the meantime they struggle during the drought to send them to school .
" it 's very difficult to switch from pastoralism to non-pastoralism overnight .
we were brought up with regular conflict and this is a tough life , " he says .
" we want our children to go to university but without cattle we will not be able to afford fees .
we are struggling to feed our children . "
boru roba , 57 , herdsman fifty-seven-year-old boru roba has been a herdsman all his life .
his wealth is measured in terms of how much livestock he has .
he has lost more than 120 head of cattle and he fears for the 60 remaining .
the cold that comes with the rains can finish off the weaker cattle .
" i am also worried about the health of people and cattle - the rain spreads diseases . "
he says the rains which have just begun are still a month too late for many .
he says the rainy seasons are much shorter than they used to be and is worried that these current rains will be short and the remaining animals might perish .
he also grows some crops but the erratic rainfall means it is much harder than it used to be .
conflicts between his borena group and others are also worse when people lose their cattle , he says , and he is concerned at the easy availability of guns .
he also says that when people lose their cattle they are forced to cut down trees to make a living which causes environmental damage and can lead to desertification .
the key solutions for the area he feels are better use of water and more education .
" we want our children to be educated and be competent in this . "
momina gababo , 32 , cattle trader momina gababo is not just a cattle owner and as such is relatively wealthy among the gabra community .
she and her husband are also cattle traders and employ people to take cattle north by foot to yabelow to sell them .
they have lost some of their livestock but still have a good number of camels , cattle and goats as they could afford to feed them .
she is 32 years old and is married with five children - and has taken in five more from relatives .
" some of the children are orphans and are impaired - before the drought we had a good income so it was not a problem to look after them .
yet i still have had cattle dying - even for me it 's not been easy . "
she expects to have more children but wants a bigger gap between them than the current two years between each of hers so far .
" i have been fortunate and have come through the drought still in good shape , but many of my neighbours have been beaten by the drought . "
she thinks people need to change their habits and traditions if they want to survive and prosper .
" cattle is not the only way to make money - people are too dependent on them .
they should be more enterprising .
there are many ways to make money . "
she also feels strongly that women have a difficult time in southern ethiopia .
" women are the first to suffer in the drought - even when the animals suffer from lack of water we hold water on our backs and travel for many kilometres to give the animals water .
" we also have to get them hay and transport it and grow food crops .
it is not easy in our culture . "
ibrahim ali , 47 , cattle owner ibrahim ali is a muslim and has had many wives during his life .
he currently has just two , having abandoned several in the past .
the 47-year-old has 16 children to look after and during the drought has lost almost all of his cattle , having just four cows left .
" two are very weak - almost dead - with the rains two will die .
i am sure of that .
" i have many children - with only two cattle .
this is what the lord wills .
i have no alternative but to bear what happens . "
he says that his family sometimes gets money from relatives and friends so they can buy some sorghum or wheat or rice , but if they do n't they can go hungry .
" sometimes we have food , sometimes we do n't .
no-one has died but many of us have had bad stomach aches and diarrhoea .
the drought affects animals and people equally . "
for the future , ibrahim wants food assistance , education in trade and farming .
we are used to drought and people die - but we also need to make sure we do n't overstock with cattle or it degrades the land .
i will tell people the truth - whatever people want to know .
tato boru , 40 , peace activist tato boru had her first child , abdi molu , when she was only 13 .
it was very difficult for her and she had two operations after giving birth , says the mother of six , who is now 40 .
" he is a good boy but he has had a difficult time .
he grew up without education and in a very rural area . "
her third son , nura , had a better education and went across the border into kenya and down to the capital , nairobi , because she thought that english was useful and may help him get a job .
however , since the drought she could n't pay the school fees and now he is back in ethiopia studying at grade nine .
" for many years life was good .
we could drink as much milk as we wanted from our cattle , but it is getting harder and drought makes it worse . "
she has lost lots of cattle in what she says is the worst drought for years .
she feels they are becoming increasingly common and linked to that is conflict and cattle rustling .
about 10 years ago the somalis took all of her livestock and she remembers it as a terrible time .
" i was one of the women who applauded the men to go and fight , " she recalls , but because of her experience with the raid she became involved in a local peace committee .
run by a local ngo , research centre for civics and human rights education backed by oxfam america , she organises visits to communities to teach the people about peace .
" it is going well - we do n't now just sympathise with our own people the borena , but also with the somalis and gabre .
" i am very happy that people will read about us and i can communicate with them about our lives . "
naima idris , 19 , unemployed naima idris does not like her life here in moyale at the moment and is frustrated .
she is 19 and after finishing school and doing a computer diploma wanted to go away to study .
however her traditional family does not want her to leave and expects her to stay here and marry .
" there is nothing good about being here , " she says .
" there are few opportunities . "
she spent a few months as a secretary but her contract ended .
she believes the culture of the cattle herding borena is too restrictive and conservative - especially for young women .
she studied for several years on the kenyan side of the border where she says it is a bit more relaxed .
she learnt english there and wants to study it further and then get a job and have some independence .
" i need education , but it 's expensive !
and as a girl i am not allowed to go away to addis ababa or awasa . "
her father owns a bus , so although they lost their only five cattle , the drought has not been a disaster for them .
however , she says conflict and hostility between the somali and borena groups in the area is a big problem .
" when droughts occur , conflict over scarcer resources is more likely to flare and with the easy availability of guns , deaths can occur . "

moyale is near the kenyan border just this week , the seasonal rains have begun after two failed rains in a row .
more than one in three people in this barren area - known as the triangle of conflict because of its proximity to the kenyan and somali borders - needs food aid and many have lost their cattle and with it any wealth they had .
the bbc news website is inviting readers around the world to put their questions to local people as they come to terms with how sustainable their lifestyles are and what their futures may hold .
they will be answering your questions throughout the day on thursday 6 april via a live laptop link-up .
click here to read your questions to the moyale community click on the links below to read more about the villagers .
aden duba boru roba momina gababo ibrahim ali tato boru naima idris aden duba , 48 , pastoralist aden duba is worried that their traditional lifestyle is not sustainable any more .
he supports eight children , two wives and another seven members of his extended family .
he says he is left with very little after having lost 21 cattle , nine goats and two camels and is worried that those left will die , despite the rainy season finally arriving .
" i live in moyale and my cattle are in the country 30kms -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- away .
even now they may be dead because of the rain .
" there is little food assistance and this is a big problem - almost everyone needs help . "
he says he is worried that if things continue like this those who lose all their animals might not live in peace .
" we are starting to sense that pastoralism is not sustainable as a livelihood anymore . "
the 48-year-old says that because of this they want their children to be educated and have more opportunities and a different life but in the meantime they struggle during the drought to send them to school .
" it 's very difficult to switch from pastoralism to non-pastoralism overnight .
we were brought up with regular conflict and this is a tough life , " he says .
" we want our children to go to university but without cattle we will not be able to afford fees .
we are struggling to feed our children . "
return to the top and send your questions boru roba , 57 , herdsman fifty-seven-year-old boru roba has been a herdsman all his life .
his wealth is measured in terms of how much livestock he has .
he has lost more than 120 head of cattle and he fears for the 60 remaining .
the cold that comes with the rains can finish off the weaker cattle .
" i am also worried about the health of people and cattle - the rain spreads diseases . "
he says the rains which have just begun are still a month too late for many .
he says the rainy seasons are much shorter than they used to be and is worried that these current rains will be short and the remaining animals might perish .
he also grows some crops but the erratic rainfall means it is much harder than it used to be .
conflicts between his borena group and others are also worse when people lose their cattle , he says , and he is concerned at the easy availability of guns .
he also says that when people lose their cattle they are forced to cut down trees to make a living which causes environmental damage and can lead to desertification .
the key solutions for the area he feels are better use of water and more education .
" we want our children to be educated and be competent in this . "
return to the top and send your questions momina gababo , 32 , cattle trader momina gababo is not just a cattle owner and as such is relatively wealthy among the gabra community .
she and her husband are also cattle traders and employ people to take cattle north by foot to yabelow to sell them .
they have lost some of their livestock but still have a good number of camels , cattle and goats as they could afford to feed them .
she is 32 years old and is married with five children - and has taken in five more from relatives .

this is what the lord wills .

he says that his family sometimes gets money from relatives and friends so they can buy some sorghum or wheat or rice , but if they do n't they can go hungry .
" sometimes we have food , sometimes we do n't .
no-one has died but many of us have had bad stomach aches and diarrhoea .
the drought affects animals and people equally . "
for the future , ibrahim wants food assistance , education in trade and farming .
we are used to drought and people die - but we also need to make sure we do n't overstock with cattle or it degrades the land .
i will tell people the truth - whatever people want to know .

it was very difficult for her and she had two operations after giving birth , says the mother of six , who is now 40 .
" he is a good boy but he has had a difficult time .
he grew up without education and in a very rural area . "
her third son , nura , had a better education and went across the border into kenya and down to the capital , nairobi , because she thought that english was useful and may help him get a job .
however , since the drought she could n't pay the school fees and now he is back in ethiopia studying at grade nine .
" for many years life was good .
we could drink as much milk as we wanted from our cattle , but it is getting harder and drought makes it worse . "
she has lost lots of cattle in what she says is the worst drought for years .
she feels they are becoming increasingly common and linked to that is conflict and cattle rustling .
about 10 years ago the somalis took all of her livestock and she remembers it as a terrible time .
" i was one of the women who applauded the men to go and fight , " she recalls , but because of her experience with the raid she became involved in a local peace committee .
run by a local ngo , research centre for civics and human rights education backed by oxfam america , she organises visits to communities to teach the people about peace .

however her traditional family does not want her to leave and expects her to stay here and marry .
" there is nothing good about being here , " she says .
" there are few opportunities . "
she spent a few months as a secretary but her contract ended .
she believes the culture of the cattle herding borena is too restrictive and conservative - especially for young women .
she studied for several years on the kenyan side of the border where she says it is a bit more relaxed .
she learnt english there and wants to study it further and then get a job and have some independence .
" i need education , but it 's expensive !
and as a girl i am not allowed to go away to addis ababa or awasa . "
her father owns a bus , so although they lost their only five cattle , the drought has not been a disaster for them .
however , she says conflict and hostility between the somali and borena groups in the area is a big problem .
" when droughts occur , conflict over scarcer resources is more likely to flare and with the easy availability of guns , deaths can occur . "

moyale is near the kenyan border just this week , the seasonal rains have begun after two failed rains in a row .
more than one in three people in this barren area - known as the triangle of conflict because of its proximity to the kenyan and somali borders - needs food aid and many have lost their cattle and with it any wealth they had .
the bbc news website is inviting readers around the world to put their questions to local people as they come to terms with how sustainable their lifestyles are and what their futures may hold .
they will be answering your questions throughout the day on thursday 6 april via a live laptop link-up .
click here to read your questions to the moyale community click on the links below to read more about the villagers .
aden duba boru roba momina gababo ibrahim ali tato boru naima idris aden duba , 48 , pastoralist aden duba is worried that their traditional lifestyle is not sustainable any more .
he supports eight children , two wives and another seven members of his extended family .
he says he is left with very little after having lost 21 cattle , nine goats and two camels and is worried that those left will die , despite the rainy season finally arriving .
" i live in moyale and my cattle are in the country 30kms -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- away .
even now they may be dead because of the rain .
" there is little food assistance and this is a big problem - almost everyone needs help . "
he says he is worried that if things continue like this those who lose all their animals might not live in peace .
" we are starting to sense that pastoralism is not sustainable as a livelihood anymore . "
the 48-year-old says that because of this they want their children to be educated and have more opportunities and a different life but in the meantime they struggle during the drought to send them to school .
" it 's very difficult to switch from pastoralism to non-pastoralism overnight .
we were brought up with regular conflict and this is a tough life , " he says .
" we want our children to go to university but without cattle we will not be able to afford fees .
we are struggling to feed our children . "
return to the top and send your questions boru roba , 57 , herdsman fifty-seven-year-old boru roba has been a herdsman all his life .
his wealth is measured in terms of how much livestock he has .
he has lost more than 120 head of cattle and he fears for the 60 remaining .
the cold that comes with the rains can finish off the weaker cattle .
" i am also worried about the health of people and cattle - the rain spreads diseases . "
he says the rains which have just begun are still a month too late for many .
he says the rainy seasons are much shorter than they used to be and is worried that these current rains will be short and the remaining animals might perish .
he also grows some crops but the erratic rainfall means it is much harder than it used to be .
conflicts between his borena group and others are also worse when people lose their cattle , he says , and he is concerned at the easy availability of guns .
he also says that when people lose their cattle they are forced to cut down trees to make a living which causes environmental damage and can lead to desertification .
the key solutions for the area he feels are better use of water and more education .
" we want our children to be educated and be competent in this . "
return to the top and send your questions momina gababo , 32 , cattle trader momina gababo is not just a cattle owner and as such is relatively wealthy among the gabra community .
she and her husband are also cattle traders and employ people to take cattle north by foot to yabelow to sell them .
they have lost some of their livestock but still have a good number of camels , cattle and goats as they could afford to feed them .
she is 32 years old and is married with five children - and has taken in five more from relatives .
" some of the children are orphans and are impaired - before the drought we had a good income so it was not a problem to look after them .
yet i still have had cattle dying - even for me it 's not been easy . "
she expects to have more children but wants a bigger gap between them than the current two years between each of hers so far .
" i have been fortunate and have come through the drought still in good shape , but many of my neighbours have been beaten by the drought . "
she thinks people need to change their habits and traditions if they want to survive and prosper .
" cattle is not the only way to make money - people are too dependent on them .
they should be more enterprising .
there are many ways to make money . "
she also feels strongly that women have a difficult time in southern ethiopia .
" women are the first to suffer in the drought - even when the animals suffer from lack of water we hold water on our backs and travel for many kilometres to give the animals water .
" we also have to get them hay and transport it and grow food crops .
it is not easy in our culture . "
return to the top and send your questions ibrahim ali , 47 , cattle owner ibrahim ali is a muslim and has had many wives during his life .
he currently has just two , having abandoned several in the past .

the idea is that you live in a specially designed community with facilities and activities laid on - but you still have your own front door .
the foundation says the villages can help provide savings in healthcare , and create jobs in local communities .
but some critics question whether these communities are simply ghettos , albeit with rather fancy gates .
at elmbridge retirement village , in the heart of the surrey stockbroker belt , the mower is gliding over one of the lawns , getting the grass in shape for the croquet players .
on friday evenings , the more sprightly of our mainly menfolk go along and play table tennis bill harris lunchtime business is building up at the nearby bar and restaurant .
about 300 people aged between 60 and 99 live here - all in their own homes .
" did you hear my hideous bell ? " jokes maisie noot , as she answers her door to the sound of electronic big ben chimes .
the doorbell was left by a previous resident , but maisie is planning to change it .
separate homes maisie and her partner bill harris , who are both in their mid seventies , have been living in separate homes at the village for five years .
it 's all very well talking about this idealistic idea of the young person with kids dropping in to look after the old person next door - but we all know it does n't really happen jon gooding their social calendar is packed with the community 's choir and line dancing sessions , and they also organise dancing parties .
with a peggy lee cd playing in the background , maisie tells me : " i have to keep up to date ready for the social evenings , so i have to keep buying new cds and listening to them , wondering how they 'll like them . "
bill adds : " on friday evenings , the more sprightly of our mainly menfolk go along and play table tennis .
" we 've had very few accidents so far !
and the darts is something else ! "
but do they miss living in a community with a mix of age ranges ?
maisie answers : " my grandson was here this weekend - he 's 30 odd - and he said he thought it was a wonderful place to live and why did n't they build villages like this for people his age ? "
bar staff a short walk away , the bowling contest is hotting up - and builders are sprucing up the bar .
" we provide the bar but it 's run , staffed and operated entirely by the residents - so they run a rota to put someone behind the bar , " says jon gooding , managing director of the firm which runs this retirement village and five others .
he denies they are closed off environments : " we really resist that ghettoisation argument .
" it 's all very well talking about people in the community and this idealistic idea of the young person with kids dropping in to look after the old person next door - but we all know it does n't really happen . "
the residents at elmbridge seem to thrive on the company and security that the retirement village offers them .
but with the properties costing six-figure sums and annual service charges of three thousand pounds , clearly this is n't an option for everyone .
and as one of the nurses helen humphries explains , the village is n't designed for those who are very frail .
" one of the criteria is that they are healthy when they come here - they 've got to be able to be self-caring , they 've got to be fully mobile and they really need to be totally mentally alert . "
helen helps look after the residents ' safety by responding to a system of alarms and movement sensors which are discreetly placed in the homes , and indicate if someone 's in trouble .
it 's that sort of touch that makes residents like maisie noot feel safe .
" bill 's cousin came to see us a while back from liverpool - and after he 'd been here a few days he said this place is incredible - it 's like going back 50 years .
" he just could n't get over it - he said it 's like how life used to be . "

with a peggy lee cd playing in the background , maisie tells me : " i have to keep up to date ready for the social evenings , so i have to keep buying new cds and listening to them , wondering how they 'll like them . "
bill adds : " on friday evenings , the more sprightly of our mainly menfolk go along and play table tennis .
" we 've had very few accidents so far !
and the darts is something else ! "
but do they miss living in a community with a mix of age ranges ?

" one of the criteria is that they are healthy when they come here - they 've got to be able to be self-caring , they 've got to be fully mobile and they really need to be totally mentally alert . "
helen helps look after the residents ' safety by responding to a system of alarms and movement sensors which are discreetly placed in the homes , and indicate if someone 's in trouble .

sketch by brian wheeler bbc news political reporter there is nothing quite as depressing as leafing through the detritus of old party leadership campaigns .
do n't look for it - it 's no longer there ...
all that misplaced optimism ; the pledges that will never be fulfilled , the heady predictions of glory long fallen wide of the mark .
that is why , no doubt , the websites set up by the men who battled it out for the leadership of the conservative party last year have all now , in one way or another , been zapped into the ether .
the old links all lead somewhere .
but in place of glossy mastheads and grinning photographs of the different hopefuls , we find the digital equivalent of tumbleweed and rusty ' closed ' signs swaying in the breeze .
since winning the contest , david cameron - an internet savvy former pr man - has merged his own web presence with that of his party .
it is all " david cameron 's conservatives " over at the official tory site these days .
' corporate gifts ' he clearly has no need for the site that started it all - cameroncampaign.org - which was finally switched off last week .
if you had clicked on the cameroncampaign.org on wednesday afternoon you would have found a list of adverts for everything from marketing and public relations services to holiday cottages in northumberland .
weirdly , the most prominent advertisement was for a cd of aston villa football songs - the premiership team that david cameron supports - complete with colourful club badge .
was this a deliberate plug for the bosses ' favourite team ?
or just a coincidence ?
david davis would like to thank all those who supported his campaign to become leader of the conservative party .
this site is now closed .
the davis campaign 's website there were also ads for , among many other things , " beauty and cosmetic " products , " farming , food and forestry " and , most intriguingly of all , " corporate gifts " .
it was all shaping up into a sketch writer 's dream .
but anyone hoping to probe further into cameron 's cyber-psyche -lrb- or make laboured jokes at his expense -rrb- will be sadly disappointed .
within minutes of the bbc news website contacting domaincheck , the newcastle-based company hosting the site , for a comment , the page had disappeared - to be replaced by a log on page for sugarcrm - an american " customer relationship marketing " company .
a spokesman for perfect day , the design and advertising company which built mr cameron 's campaign website , said it had inadvertently been paying for the bandwith until last week , when they cancelled it .
as to why aston villa cds had been advertised on the site - or where sugarcrm fitted into the picture - he said : " i ca n't help you there . "
traditional values less mystery surrounds kenneth clarke 's erstwhile campaign site .
all that remains of the clarke campaign following an old link to the site brings you to a grey page informing users " this account has been suspended " .
beneath that , in smaller print , we find " please contact the billing / support department as soon as possible " .
but a spokeswoman for mr clarke , who worked on his campaign , said the domain name kennethclarke.co.uk had been rented for the duration of the campaign .
it had now been cancelled and all bills paid , the spokeswoman said , with mr clarke reverting back to using his rushcliffe conservatives constituency site .
dr liam fox 's website , which was a glitzy multi-media effort just a few months ago , now brings up a blank page with the error message " forbidden - you do n't have permission to access / on this server " malcolm rifkind did not reach the stage of having a campaign website .
that 's much more like it ...
only shadow home secretary david davis - appropriately enough for a bastion of traditional values - has continued to welcome visitors , providing a courteous explanation of what they have stumbled across .
mr davis retained the domain from his ill-fated 2001 leadership bid - modernconservatives , a name briefly touted as a new identity for the party as a whole .

sketch by brian wheeler bbc news political reporter there is nothing quite as depressing as leafing through the detritus of old party leadership campaigns .
all that misplaced optimism ; the pledges that will never be fulfilled , the heady predictions of glory long fallen wide of the mark .
that is why , no doubt , the websites set up by the men who battled it out for the leadership of the conservative party last year have all now , in one way or another , been zapped into the ether .
the old links all lead somewhere .
but in place of glossy mastheads and grinning photographs of the different hopefuls , we find the digital equivalent of tumbleweed and rusty ' closed ' signs swaying in the breeze .
since winning the contest , david cameron - an internet savvy former pr man - has merged his own web presence with that of his party .
it is all " david cameron 's conservatives " over at the official tory site these days .
' corporate gifts ' he clearly has no need for the site that started it all - cameroncampaign.org - which was finally switched off last week .
if you had clicked on the cameroncampaign.org on wednesday afternoon you would have found a list of adverts for everything from marketing and public relations services to holiday cottages in northumberland .
weirdly , the most prominent advertisement was for a cd of aston villa football songs - the premiership team that david cameron supports - complete with colourful club badge .
was this a deliberate plug for the bosses ' favourite team ?
or just a coincidence ? "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : a-day pension reforms bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 07:59 gmt , thursday , 6 april 2006 08:59 uk q & a : a-day pension reforms 6 april is a-day , heralding the biggest shake up of uk pensions in more than a decade .
the bbc news website examines what these pension changes mean to you and your finances .
what exactly is a-day ?
on 6 april , a new set of pension rules come into force .
from now on , if you want to be a member of a company pension scheme and save money in a personal pension at the same time , then you can .
previously , dual rights to membership of a company scheme and a personal pension plan was only open to people who earned less than £ 30,000 a year .
you will also be able to draw your pension and carry on working .
the big idea is to make pension saving much less complex .
i am in my fifties and wonder whether i am too old to start a pension , what do the a-day changes mean to me ?
one of the key a-day changes is designed to tempt people like you to save in a pension .
in the past , a major criticism of the uk pension system was that it took many years for most people to be able to build up a substantial pension fund .
the complex system , which linked the percentage of income people were allowed to save in a pension to their age , was blamed for this .
this system has now been swept away .
in future , people can invest up to 100 % of their earned income in any tax year - up to a ceiling of £ 215,000 - and receive tax relief at their highest marginal rate .
this should allow people to save substantial sums in their pension quickly .
in addition , people will be free to build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m , before tax restrictions kick in .
this lifetime limit will rise to £ 1.8m in 2010 .
are the annuity rules changing ?
yes , they are .
the requirement which forces pension savers to buy an annuity by their 75th birthday is being abolished .
instead , pension savers will be able to draw an income direct from their pension fund .
however , it was announced in march 's budget that pension funds which are not used to buy an annuity would be subject to inheritance tax -lrb- iht -rrb- .
will this help solve the uk pensions crisis ?
on its own , a-day is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the levels of uk pensions saving .
last year 's report by the government 's pensions commission concluded that the uk 's pensions problem is both deep-rooted and long-term .
put simply , the uk is going to have to find a way to pay for people living longer .
a-day does nothing about this demographic timebomb , as it has been dubbed .
as for firms closing employee workplace final salary pension schemes , a-day offers no way out .
what does the financial services industry think of a-day ?
the industry , for once , is almost united in welcoming a-day .
pension saving has had a terrible press in recent years .
mis-selling scandals , poor performance and high charges have led to personal pensions losing their appeal .
in short , many people see pension saving as too complex and restrictive .
against the backdrop of a booming housing market , increasing numbers of people have been relying on buy-to-let property to provide the financial wherewithal for a comfortable old age .
the industry hopes that the a-day changes - reducing complexity and introducing greater flexibility - will persuade people to turn once again to pension saving .
only time will tell whether their hopes will come to fruition .

the bbc news website examines what these pension changes mean to you and your finances .
what exactly is a-day ?
on 6 april , a new set of pension rules come into force .
from now on , if you want to be a member of a company pension scheme and save money in a personal pension at the same time , then you can .
previously , dual rights to membership of a company scheme and a personal pension plan was only open to people who earned less than £ 30,000 a year .
you will also be able to draw your pension and carry on working .
the big idea is to make pension saving much less complex .
i am in my fifties and wonder whether i am too old to start a pension , what do the a-day changes mean to me ?
one of the key a-day changes is designed to tempt people like you to save in a pension .
in the past , a major criticism of the uk pension system was that it took many years for most people to be able to build up a substantial pension fund .
the complex system , which linked the percentage of income people were allowed to save in a pension to their age , was blamed for this .
this system has now been swept away .
in future , people can invest up to 100 % of their earned income in any tax year - up to a ceiling of £ 215,000 - and receive tax relief at their highest marginal rate .
this should allow people to save substantial sums in their pension quickly .
in addition , people will be free to build up a pension fund up to a lifetime limit , initially £ 1.5m , before tax restrictions kick in .
this lifetime limit will rise to £ 1.8m in 2010 .
are the annuity rules changing ?
yes , they are .
the requirement which forces pension savers to buy an annuity by their 75th birthday is being abolished .
instead , pension savers will be able to draw an income direct from their pension fund .
however , it was announced in march 's budget that pension funds which are not used to buy an annuity would be subject to inheritance tax -lrb- iht -rrb- .
will this help solve the uk pensions crisis ?
on its own , a-day is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on the levels of uk pensions saving .
last year 's report by the government 's pensions commission concluded that the uk 's pensions problem is both deep-rooted and long-term .
put simply , the uk is going to have to find a way to pay for people living longer .
a-day does nothing about this demographic timebomb , as it has been dubbed .
as for firms closing employee workplace final salary pension schemes , a-day offers no way out .
what does the financial services industry think of a-day ?
the industry , for once , is almost united in welcoming a-day .
pension saving has had a terrible press in recent years .
mis-selling scandals , poor performance and high charges have led to personal pensions losing their appeal .
in short , many people see pension saving as too complex and restrictive .
against the backdrop of a booming housing market , increasing numbers of people have been relying on buy-to-let property to provide the financial wherewithal for a comfortable old age .
the industry hopes that the a-day changes - reducing complexity and introducing greater flexibility - will persuade people to turn once again to pension saving .
only time will tell whether their hopes will come to fruition .

a top geologist claims the depleted gas fields off norfolk , suffolk and essex could become a billion-pound industry .
the government wants to stop release of emissions from power stations and large energy users into the environment .
nick riley , from the british geological survey , said strata emptied of natural gas could be used for emission storage .
north sea gas supplies will run out in the next three decades and the uk produces more than 630,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year - a third of this comes from power stations .
existing routes geologists now believe the huge infrastructure of north sea pipes and rigs could be a key factor in developing storage facilities for this carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases for the uk and countries that rim the north sea .
emissions such as carbon dioxide could be captured and pumped into the empty gas fields for permanent storage or for when they might be needed .
nick riley , head of research for emission storage at the british geological survey , and said : " east anglia is key to this development because it is the nearest region to the gas fields .
" offshore there is an infrastructure of gas interconnectors , pipes and rigs .
it makes sense to use these existing routes and lay new pipes to feed into the system .
" we could be storing up to a third of our carbon dioxide emissions in this way by the end of this century . "
government scientists are looking into the idea but greenpeace warns it would have no impact in cutting carbon dioxide emissions from homes , businesses and transport .
a spokesman for greenpeace said north sea storage was not a silver bullet and reducing the use of hydrocarbons was still an important way to cut greenhouse gas emissions .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .

for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .

he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .

prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .

this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

half of them were on remand awaiting trial , or sentencing .
this was the case with wesley mcgoldrick , who was caught shoplifting cheese and milk from a london branch of sainsbury 's on saturday 16 april 2005 .
when he admitted also carrying a knife , the 24-year-old was arrested and charged .
as he had no fixed address to be bailed to , after a weekend in a police station he was remanded into custody at brixton prison .
by the tuesday afternoon , less than a day after his arrival at the jail , he was dead , having used bed sheets to hang himself from the bars of his cell window .
he was the 21st person to kill himself in prison in england and wales that year .
another 57 were to follow .
the prison service says it is " completely committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents " but a combination of circumstances make this a difficult task .
he was a real person and was my son but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number gina webb , wesley mcgoldrick 's mother the set of factors that surrounded wesley 's death are " sadly all too common " according to deborah coles , co-director of inquest , a pressure group which provides support to families in deaths in custody cases .
he was a young male who had recently been remanded into a local prison - features which " are well known to the prison authorities for being over-represented for the number of people dying , " she said .
almost a third of suicides occur within the first week of someone arriving in custody and one in seven is within 48 hours .
remand prisoners are likely to be placed in a local jail , many of which are overcrowded and may lack the staff or resources to provide intensive support for new inmates .
' found dead ' the first wesley 's mother , gina webb , knew of her son 's death was when her daughter turned up on her doorstep in the early hours of the morning , flanked by two police officers and sobbing hysterically .
the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
an investigation recommended changes in procedure at brixton staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "

the only information the officers had was that wesley had been " found dead " - at that point neither gina nor the police knew he was in jail .
" i had nothing to go on , just that one statement thrown in my face , " she said .
" ' where did it happen ?
how did it happen ?
was it an accident ?
was he murdered ? '
it did n't matter what i asked , the answer was ' sorry , we do n't know ' . "
it was another day before she found out what had happened and a further day before she could identify the body .
' signs of paranoia ' once a keen athlete and footballer , wesley had drifted into homelessness in his early 20s .
he had taken catering work with live-in positions but could n't settle and the nature of his work meant that if he lost a job he also lost his home .
his mother says she begged him to come back to the family home in ruislip , middlesex , but he would not .
prison suicides 2005 78 deaths in england and wales 8 deaths in scotland -lrb- 2004/05 -rrb- 37 % on remand awaiting trial 12 were under 21 years of age youngest was 16 four were women 80 % were in local prisons 131 people resuscitated after acts of self harm source : howard league full list of the 78 who died he was sleeping rough at the time of his arrest and gina suspects he " wanted to get caught so he would have a roof over his head for the weekend " .
evidence heard at the inquest into wesley 's death indicated he had mental health issues .
gina believes her son 's crime and his last desperate act were " a cry for help " .
officers at kennington police station , where he was taken on his arrest , were sufficiently concerned about his state of mind to call a doctor who noted " signs of increasing paranoia " .
however , the doctor 's note was not seen by anyone at brixton prison , the inquest heard .
staff there said they judged wesley 's mental state based on conversations with him and the answers he gave to a medical questionnaire .
neither gave any cause for alarm , they said , even though he admitted self harming previously .
under the prison 's own procedures this meant he should have been referred for a mental health assessment but this did not happen and he was not placed on suicide watch .
an investigation by the prison ombudsman recommended that mental health assessment training at brixton was tightened up .
the governor of the prison , john podmore , said " all prisoners undergo a comprehensive screening process " which " examines all aspects of mental and physical health as well as drug and alcohol issues " .
he added : " we are working hard ... to provide the highest standards of care for prisoners and continually looking to see how that provision can be improved .
" tragedies such as the death of mr mcgoldrick cause us to look even harder particularly in the light of reports emanating from these events ... our sympathies once again go to the family of mr mcgoldrick . "
fall in suicide rate suicide and self harm is recognised as one of the toughest challenges facing the prison service .
a study in the lancet found the male suicide rate in prison was five times that in the general community .
the 2004-05 annual report from hm chief inspector of prisons observed : " the pressure of population , the reactive culture in some prisons and the vulnerability of many of those in prison , will continue to make it difficult for prisons properly to protect those in their care . "
but some headway does appear to be being made : the total number of suicides fell last year from 95 in 2004 to 78 , a welcome drop after three years of record levels of self-inflicted deaths .
it comes as prisons are beginning to implement a new system known as acct - assessment , care in custody and teamwork - which replaces the old suicide watch forms and is designed to be more focussed on the individual .
in addition , a new health screening process has been set up that is designed to detect mental health issues on arrival into custody .
many jails now have several " safer cells " designed to be as free from potential ligature points as possible .
and the majority of prisons also run listener schemes in which samaritans-trained prisoners provide 24-hour confidential support to other inmates .
prevention measures a home office spokesman said " every death in custody is a terrible tragedy for the families left behind and also has a profound effect on staff and other prisoners .
" the government takes the issue of suicide in prisons very seriously and , in the face of population pressures , suicide prevention efforts have continued with unprecedented energy and commitment . "
but gina webb is still angry at a system which she believes failed wesley .
" he was a real person and was my son - they all belong to somebody , they 're somebody 's husband or somebody 's son .
but while they 're in prison they 're nothing , they 're just a number , " she said .
" what ever reason they 're in there for , they 're in there .
the state has a duty to care for the people they 're supposedly looking after and quite frankly they have n't done it . "
add your comments using the form below this is a really sad story and the part that angered me the most was the comment that these things are ' sadly all too common ' .
this partly makes me want to become a social worker to help these people , but then i do n't want to be part of an organisation that seems to be failing these people .
he was homeless and stole from a supermarket .
he did not deserve to die .
surely we have a duty to help people like this rather than see them as a statistic .
andy wood , berkhamsted , uk our prisons are overcrowded with thousands of people being held on remand .
our government should look to educating people and providing adequate services for the homeless and the mentally ill .
a contentious suggestion i know , maybe this would not seem such a pipe dream if we were to pay a couple more pence in the pound in income tax .
when will our government accept prison does not work .
terri knight , birmingham no-one could doubt the pain of this young man 's family but there is no answer to this problem : unstable people harm themselves but that is no argument against containing them .
what if he had remained at large and used his knife ?
matthew , london i was fairly unsympathetic until i read that wesley had been homeless and emotionally disturbed at the time of his arrest .
this is the stage at which people * should * be provided with a safety net ; we should n't be waiting until they arrive in prison .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk i was a samaritan prison co-ordinator for feltham and wormwood scrubs and a regular prison visitor .
sadly many who comit suicide should be in either the prison health centre or in a mental health institution .
for the first few weeks both convicted prsoners and those on remand should not be put in single cells , but with others who may be trained in sucide awareness .
often , particularly with juveniles and young offenders , all that is needed is for someone to listen to the genuine fears felt by new inmates .
i know from personal experience that the majority of prison officers are genuinely concerned by prison suicides but most prisons are understaffed and underfunded .
clive cunningham , libourne , france what a waste of life !
maybe young adults must be kept under surveillance in jail all the time.young people are more malleable and under good mentorship they could become good citizens and be productive .
my heart goes to his family .
lucy , mansfield i am sorry but he is no child at 24 .
yes he should perhaps have been better supervised but he made life choices for whatever reason - he was a fully grown adult .
andy stafford , reading while my immense sympathy goes out to the families who suffer due to incidents like this one , i think it is unfair to simply blame the system .
it is stretched to the limits because of the amount of criminals that our police are managing to get off the streets .
if you want to blame someone , blame the scores of criminals who are not only putting a huge strain on the prison system , but on our country itself .
i am aware that most petty criminals are very desperate people , but there many other desperate people who do not turn to crime .
james , cambridge the fact is people really do n't understand mental illness , this guy should never have been in prison in the first place , but because of general fear of an individual and the way our society believes in a " not seen , not heard " world , innocent people end up in a catch22 situation .
steve , london it makes you wonder why such a vulnerable young man , was placed in custody in the first place for such a minor offence .
regulations should be in place for such people to be placed somewhere where they can seek help rather than locked up like a dangerous criminal .
the system failed him .
daniel horton , portsmouth people seem to forget that for everyone in prison loads more victims have been left with shattered lives .
when or even if they get caught i want to see proper punishment as deterent then re-educated , otherwise your rewarding criminals .
liz , manchester everyone deserves a second chance right ?
thats what i 've always stood by .
wesley was a tragic victim of the system and it saddens me to hear that this is how our justice system operates .
i am suprised that the courts have not taken into account his circumstances ? community service wouldnt that have been a better option ?
these sorts of issues will continue to happen unless a meaningful plan is put into place before sending offenders to prison .
maya , london i sympathise with this particular case .
unfortunately , my wife and i have been victims of a burglary and serious vandalism over the past 12 months .
the police do not seem interested in such crime that afflicts honest , hardworking and upstanding citizens of this country .
these crimes may be petty in relation to others , but they certainly do affect us and we need the police to take a hard stance on such crimes .
niraj , london every unecessary death , particularly a suicide , is tragic .
however , the state has the responsibility to provide clean , safe accomodation in prison and to ensure that the detainee is fed , clothed and reasonably comfortable .
the state is not a babysitter and if this young man did not present officials with sufficient reason to believe that there were mental problems , then there was no reason to handle things differently .
the fact that he chose to end his life is very sad , but his suicide can not be blamed on the state .
alex , edinburgh the fact that this guy was carrying a knife is , to a large extent , neither here nor there ; he was living rough , he almost certainly had it for protection rather than to attack someone with .
this is a terribly sad story .
yes the prisons are overstretched , but if people such as him were in mental institutions , where they could receive the help and treatment they needed , rather than locked up in prison where things are only going to be made worse , things would be better both for the prison service and for the mentally ill who end up as inmates .
jane , portsmouth prisons take the worst from society .
the drug addicted , the disturbed , people with personality disorders , and it therefore follows that prisons are full of those more inclined to have suicidal tendancies .
you should therefore be congratulating the prison service and its employees for keeping so many of them from successfully killing themselves .
for every successful suicide , there will be literally hundreds of attempts thwarted by dedicated , caring , prison staff , and therefore hundreds of lives saved .
steve , cambs regardless of anything wesley mcgoldrick was a a person , and one who clearly needed support and guidance and his death should be shown as a shining example of the inadequacies of a system which allows lives to fall through the cracks .
d , london i think there is much more to this story than we have been told , it is so improbable that a first time shop lifter would be remanded in prison .
also , his mental health problems were never proven so how was anybody else supposed to know ?
finally , he could have returned home to live with his mother and get his life back on track but instead he turned to crime .
so why is this all the fault of prisons ?
tracey campbell , rennes , france i find it appalling that the doctor 's note suggesting increasing signs of paranoia was not even seen by anyone at brixton prison .
had this happened , perhaps wesley mcgoldrick would have been better taken care of , better supervised and prevented from taking his own life .
i see the point people are trying to make that the system alone should n't be blamed but the fact is he did commit the crime and he was put into custody , and once there i feel the police should have made more of an effort to take better care of him .
becky , cheshire i have worked in the prison service as a nurse for 9 years and unfortunately been involved in caring for numerous prisoners who have self-harmed or attempted suicide , also several who actually did kill themselves .
the sad fact is that it is impossible to watch 75,000 prisoners 24/7 which is what would be required to prevent any suicides at all .
all that staff can do is attempt to identify those at highest risk and respond accordingly , however most people who have been involved with any suicides will know that many are completely out of the blue , others are a cry for help that goes too far .
a suicide rate of 0.001 % of the prison population is really not that bad if you look at it that way lynne , gloucester speaking from 1st hand experience as an ex-con there is absolutely nothing done for mentally ill prisoners , i saw numerous inmates who quite clearly should not have been in prison but should have been receiving treatment .
to watch them gradually deteriorate and in two cases commit suicide was very depressing .
i will say however that the majority of prison warders were decent people they felt the same , that these guys simply should n't be there but their hands were tied .
furthermore there is no rehabilitation in english prisons , it 's a disgrace you end up with youngsters going to prison for minor offences and coming out having learnt a whole load of new criminal skills , prisons are basically schools for criminals .
james , uk if he was n't in prison he would probably still have committed suicide .
i was in a similar situation when i was a teenager and i ended up on remand .
some parents just do n't know what is happening to their children .
s brown , mansfield how does locking the disadvantaged up in cells help anybody ?
prisons are a breeding ground of crime and drug addiction .
rehabilitaion ?
you must be joking .
andrew , london so many people feel that this young man was in need of support and guidance but seem to overlook the fact that he was stealing and was armed with a knife .
he may well have had it for self defence , but does that mean he would never have used it on someone in the process of committing a crime ?
the system may well be partly to blame , but there are many more factors that cause someone to turn to crime .
christopher . , chester having helped run christian courses in prison and seen many young men like wesley my assessment of the present system is that " prison is not the answer " these young men are often crying out for love and compassion in their lives and so often what they get is the opposite , a radical rethink is required , we can not continue locking people up hoping the problem will go away .
john corbin leeds , leeds west yorkshire all the paper work , the pressures , the deadlines for training to prevent such tragedies take place at prisons .
however every person that kills himself is a horrendous thing that we should look at .
i do believe that we get so wrapped up in procedures and processes and protocol that we forget that the person we are dealing with is suffering every minute of the time we take to fill papers out ! !
its disappointing and shameful .
working at a prison myself with young people , i find it enormously frustrating .
i can feel the pain of his family .

" it was exciting to see some of the new order of the phoenix sets , but most of all to see the actors again . "
she said it was " slightly unnerving to realise that nearly all of them are taller than me now " .
rowling met evanna lynch , who plays luna lovegood in the movie , and described her as " perfect " for the role .

they will be trying to persuade the jury not to have him executed - only three days after it ruled he was eligible for the death penalty .
the defence plans to call a psychiatric expert to say moussaoui is schizophrenic , and a sociologist to say he suffered racism as an impoverished child in france .
those mitigating circumstances , they hope , will build jury sympathy for the only person tried in the united states for the 11 september attacks .
but the prosecution has its own plans to counter such appeals to emotion .
government lawyers are expected to read out the names of 2,972 people who died in the deadliest attack on us soil , and to show photographs of each .
they will also call as witnesses about 45 relatives of people who died on 9/11 .
conflicting testimony moussaoui 's exact role in 9/11 remains unclear , despite years of investigation - and his own testimony in court . "
i know the materialistic western mind can not grasp the idea , and it is difficult for them to believe that high officials in al-qaeda do not know about operations carried out by its operatives , but this is how it works " khalid sheikh mohammed after his arrest three weeks before the attacks , he said he was to be part of a later wave of strikes , not the 9/11 plot itself .
then , when he took the stand at his trial in march 2006 , he stunned the court by saying he had been training to fly a plane into the white house on the same day the world trade center and pentagon were attacked .
it is not clear how credible that claim is , not least because it directly contradicts testimony from what might seem to be an unimpeachable source - khalid sheikh mohammed , generally believed to be the mastermind behind the attacks .
sheikh mohammed has been in us custody at an undisclosed location for three years , but moussaoui 's defence team introduced nearly 60 pages of evidence gleaned from his interrogation .
the opening statement accompanying the submission notes that sheikh mohammed " is not available to testify either in person or by video for national security reasons " , but adds that his comments " were made under circumstances designed to elicit truthful statements from the witness " .
sheikh mohammed makes absolutely clear in the testimony that moussaoui was to be part of a second , ill-defined attack on the us after 9/11 .
the senior al-qaeda planner did not expect the 9/11 attacks to be as spectacularly effective as they were - or the overwhelming us response - and so hoped to carry off a similar strike later with hijackers who carried non-arab passports .
moussaoui , a french citizen , could have played a role in the later attacks , sheikh mohammed told his interrogators .
inside al-qaeda his evidence was among the most detailed look into how al-qaeda planned the event - and the first time he has been heard from unambiguously since he disappeared into us custody in march 2003 .
-lrb- the 9/11 commission report cites evidence he gave interrogators , but does not quote him directly .
evidence thought to be from him was used in the trial of suspected al-qaeda plotter mounir al-motassadek , but sheikh mohammed was not named as the source of the information . -rrb-
in a written statement , he said westerners would find it hard to understand how compartmentalised al-qaeda was .
" i know the materialistic western mind can not grasp the idea , and it is difficult for them to believe that high officials in al-qaeda do not know about operations carried out by its operatives , but this is how it works , " he said .
he added that al-qaeda ran on absolute obedience to osama bin laden - though he himself appeared to have a slightly uneasy relationship with the leader , the bbc 's security correspondent gordon corera says .
he held off pledging loyalty to bin laden as long as he could , he told interrogators , and even had to tell the al-qaeda chief to keep quiet about the upcoming attacks after bin laden hinted at them in august 2001 .
counting the cost but neither osama bin laden nor khalid sheikh mohammed will be before the jury in alexandria , virginia - zacarias moussaoui will .
prosecutors will introduce a mountain of information to persuade the jury that he deserves a lethal injection .
in addition to the names of the dead , they will cite examples of the damage the 9/11 attacks did to new york and its economy : the deaths of 343 firefighters , 23 police officers , an fbi agent and a secret service officer the destruction of 12m sq ft -lrb- 1m sq metres -rrb- of office space and more than 467 government vehicles the disruption of rail and subway trains several billion dollars worth of property damage the defence , for its part , seems to be planning an appeal to the jury 's hoped-for bloody-mindedness .
moussaoui wants to be executed as a warrior who fought america , his lawyers will say .
he should be denied that privilege , edward macmahon said as the first phase of the trial ended : " do n't make him a hero , ladies and gentlemen . "

they will be trying to persuade the jury not to have him executed - only three days after it ruled he was eligible for the death penalty .
the defence plans to call a psychiatric expert to say moussaoui is schizophrenic , and a sociologist to say he suffered racism as an impoverished child in france .
those mitigating circumstances , they hope , will build jury sympathy for the only person tried in the united states for the 11 september attacks .
but the prosecution has its own plans to counter such appeals to emotion .
government lawyers are expected to read out the names of 2,972 people who died in the deadliest attack on us soil , and to show photographs of each .
they will also call as witnesses about 45 relatives of people who died on 9/11 .
conflicting testimony moussaoui 's exact role in 9/11 remains unclear , despite years of investigation - and his own testimony in court .
i know the materialistic western mind can not grasp the idea , and it is difficult for them to believe that high officials in al-qaeda do not know about operations carried out by its operatives , but this is how it works khalid sheikh mohammed khalid sheikh mohammed testimony -lrb- 1.6 mb -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
download the reader here after his arrest three weeks before the attacks , he said he was to be part of a later wave of strikes , not the 9/11 plot itself .
then , when he took the stand at his trial in march 2006 , he stunned the court by saying he had been training to fly a plane into the white house on the same day the world trade center and pentagon were attacked .
it is not clear how credible that claim is , not least because it directly contradicts testimony from what might seem to be an unimpeachable source - khalid sheikh mohammed , generally believed to be the mastermind behind the attacks .
sheikh mohammed has been in us custody at an undisclosed location for three years , but moussaoui 's defence team introduced nearly 60 pages of evidence gleaned from his interrogation .
the opening statement accompanying the submission notes that sheikh mohammed " is not available to testify either in person or by video for national security reasons " , but adds that his comments " were made under circumstances designed to elicit truthful statements from the witness " .
sheikh mohammed makes absolutely clear in the testimony that moussaoui was to be part of a second , ill-defined attack on the us after 9/11 .
the senior al-qaeda planner did not expect the 9/11 attacks to be as spectacularly effective as they were - or the overwhelming us response - and so hoped to carry off a similar strike later with hijackers who carried non-arab passports .
moussaoui , a french citizen , could have played a role in the later attacks , sheikh mohammed told his interrogators .
inside al-qaeda sheikh mohammed has been in us custody since march 2003 his evidence was among the most detailed look into how al-qaeda planned the event - and the first time he has been heard from unambiguously since he disappeared into us custody in march 2003 .
-lrb- the 9/11 commission report cites evidence he gave interrogators , but does not quote him directly .
evidence thought to be from him was used in the trial of suspected al-qaeda plotter mounir al-motassadek , but sheikh mohammed was not named as the source of the information . -rrb-
in a written statement , he said westerners would find it hard to understand how compartmentalised al-qaeda was .
" i know the materialistic western mind can not grasp the idea , and it is difficult for them to believe that high officials in al-qaeda do not know about operations carried out by its operatives , but this is how it works , " he said .
he added that al-qaeda ran on absolute obedience to osama bin laden - though he himself appeared to have a slightly uneasy relationship with the leader , the bbc 's security correspondent gordon corera says .
he held off pledging loyalty to bin laden as long as he could , he told interrogators , and even had to tell the al-qaeda chief to keep quiet about the upcoming attacks after bin laden hinted at them in august 2001 .
counting the cost but neither osama bin laden nor khalid sheikh mohammed will be before the jury in alexandria , virginia - zacarias moussaoui will .
prosecutors will introduce a mountain of information to persuade the jury that he deserves a lethal injection .
in addition to the names of the dead , they will cite examples of the damage the 9/11 attacks did to new york and its economy : the deaths of 343 firefighters , 23 police officers , an fbi agent and a secret service officer the destruction of 12m sq ft -lrb- 1m sq metres -rrb- of office space and more than 467 government vehicles the disruption of rail and subway trains several billion dollars worth of property damage the defence , for its part , seems to be planning an appeal to the jury 's hoped-for bloody-mindedness .
moussaoui wants to be executed as a warrior who fought america , his lawyers will say .
he should be denied that privilege , edward macmahon said as the first phase of the trial ended : " do n't make him a hero , ladies and gentlemen . "

the moves to involve citizens in journalism come amid a perverse backlash against citizen journalism by some in the traditional , professional media .
the latest attack appeared last week on the cbs news public eye blog , where one of america 's most prominent journalism organisations discusses how the news is made .
a journalism professor and new york times education columnist samuel freedman blasted citizen journalists as , among other things , mere producers of raw material rather than finished product , and opinion-givers in an echo chamber of like-minded amateurs .

they can , and should , go considerably deeper , however , by giving audiences the tools to participate more fully in the emergent global conversation of which journalism is a vital part .
local publishers and broadcasters should be aiming to help their communities engage in that conversation , via blogs , podcasts , discussion boards and all of the other conversational tools .

most people do n't care to be journalists , but many of us can and will occasionally commit an act of journalism , and it would be useful for people to understand some of the principles that have served the professionals , and their audiences , so well for so long .

if bird flu mutates to humans , it could cut asia 's economic output by as much as $ 300bn -lrb- £ 170bn -rrb- , the bank said .
" at its worst , this would essentially halt economic growth for one year and throw the world into the first global recession since 1982 , " adb said .
bird flu has so far killed about 100 people across asia .
' severe impact ' the bank stressed that its analysis was based on a worst-case scenario in which between two and seven million people died during a pandemic .
the economic impact of such an outcome would be " severe " , with key sectors of the economy such as tourism and banking badly disrupted . "
poor countries in asia would face immense challenges " asian development bank bird flu : country-by-country preparations its report echoes a recent study by the world bank which said that bird flu could cast a " long shadow " over asian economic prospects .
according to the adb , poorer countries would be hard pressed to deal with the pressure on their health systems and welfare services .
in commercial terms , countries with large services sectors such as hong kong , china and singapore would be worst affected and the fall in economic activity could have a devastating effect on global trade .
based on current assumptions , however , the economic fallout from a human flu pandemic would not last long .
after the 2003 sars outbreak , asian economies recovered relatively quickly , and the adb believes the turnaround from a bird flu pandemic would follow the same pattern .
" economic activity would likely return to " normal " within one year and reach pre-pandemic levels in two to three years , " the bank noted in its 2006 economic outlook - a survey of 43 developing countries in the region excluding japan .
bird flu is already estimated to have cost asian countries up to $ 15bn in lost economic output , with the poultry trade severely curtailed .
sustained growth should a pandemic not occur , developing asian economies are forecast to deliver strong growth this year .
average growth of 7.2 % is expected across the region , slightly down from the 7.4 % seen last year , with both the chinese and indian economies cooling slightly .
china is expected to record 9.5 % growth in 2006 with the indian economy expanding 7.6 % .
" asia is well-positioned for sustained growth over the medium-term , " said ifzal ali , the manila-based body 's chief economist .

poor countries in asia would face immense challenges asian development bank bird flu : country-by-country preparations its report echoes a recent study by the world bank which said that bird flu could cast a " long shadow " over asian economic prospects .
according to the adb , poorer countries would be hard pressed to deal with the pressure on their health systems and welfare services .
in commercial terms , countries with large services sectors such as hong kong , china and singapore would be worst affected and the fall in economic activity could have a devastating effect on global trade .
based on current assumptions , however , the economic fallout from a human flu pandemic would not last long .
after the 2003 sars outbreak , asian economies recovered relatively quickly , and the adb believes the turnaround from a bird flu pandemic would follow the same pattern .
" economic activity would likely return to " normal " within one year and reach pre-pandemic levels in two to three years , " the bank noted in its 2006 economic outlook - a survey of 43 developing countries in the region excluding japan .
bird flu is already estimated to have cost asian countries up to $ 15bn in lost economic output , with the poultry trade severely curtailed .

average growth of 7.2 % is expected across the region , slightly down from the 7.4 % seen last year , with both the chinese and indian economies cooling slightly .
china is expected to record 9.5 % growth in 2006 with the indian economy expanding 7.6 % .
" asia is well-positioned for sustained growth over the medium-term , " said ifzal ali , the manila-based body 's chief economist .
