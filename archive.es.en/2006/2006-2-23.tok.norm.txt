a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .

" before opening the archives to researchers indiscriminately , questions of privacy and liability for the misuse of this sensitive data needs to be addressed , " a german foreign ministry spokesperson told the new york times . germany is coming under increased pressure from the us and holocaust historians to release the files , and , last year , 20 countries published a joint statement backing the us position and called for the urgent release of the documents to researchers . one american researcher has called the refusal to open the archive " a form of holocaust denial . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of holocaust victims and their fate are held in the archive the international tracing service , a branch of the international committee of the red cross that was established to help families discover what had happened to their relatives , holds the documents which were gathered by allied forces as they liberated nazi concentration camps in the final days of world war ii . secret programs and horrific experiments the documents detail horrific medical experiments and include files on alleged collaborators among concentration camp inmates . there is also comprehensive documentation on the lebensborn program , under which tens of thousands of children born to women in nazi-occupied countries and fathered by german soldiers were sent to special educational facilities , where they were raised to be part of the nazis ' so-called " master race .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .
" it 's a fitting conclusion to the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. motte alias matthias röingh brings the love the love parade will live again in the city that gave birth to it thanks to a cash injection from rainer schaller , owner of mcfit , germany 's largest fitness studio chain and the parade 's key corporate sponsor .
in recent years the parade was moved to austria , switzerland , britain , israel , south africa , mexico and san francisco . " the love parade is a german export hit .
this brand has achieved cult status and is known worldwide .
that this mega event should not take place in its homeland just because of financial problems was unacceptable for me , " said schaller . from a street party of hundreds to a parade of over a million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 1.5 million ravers turned up for the parade 's high point in 1999 beginning life as a street party for around 200 people in west berlin in 1989 , the party became a parade after the fall of the berlin wall .
after germany became one again , the parade expanded rapidly and became a symbol for berlin 's hip and revitalized image during the heady , euphoric days of the 1990s .
at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ... ' till dusk again ...
however , an economic " upper " is the only additive the organizers are likely to advocate .
" i think the love parade should be saying we think drugs are uncool , " dr motte told the press conference , adding that booths will be set up at the festival to educate the revelers about the negative effects of drugs . ravers at the parade often rely on stimulants to keep them dancing for days without interruption . dr. motte also said the festival 's organizers were discussing the security situation with german police and other authorities to assure that the party is as safe and orderly as possible . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade demise is test for techno berlin 's giant annual street party , the love parade , was cancelled for the second year in a row when sponsorship fell flat .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .

and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.02.2006 germany pledges to further ties with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government under angela merkel hopes to develop close ties with china ending his three-nation tour of asia , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has met with chinese president hu jintao in beijing .
a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

further tests were being carried out to establish if it had the highly pathogenic strain of bird flu which can be fatal to humans .
the test results were expected later thursday from the friedrich löffler institute , germany 's main veterinary laboratory . the infected duck came from a small poultry farm of some 106 chickens and ducks near the town of putbus on rügen .
all the poultry on the farm was slaughtered on wednesday after routine testing raised suspicions about three birds , but only the duck was found to have the disease .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first cases of the flu in germany were found in wild swans germany is the second country in the european union to confirm bird flu among poultry , after two chickens in southern austria were found to be infected with the deadly h5n1 strain of the virus on wednesday . however , if confirmed to have h5n1 , the german ducks would be the first infected farm poultry in the eu as the two austrian chickens were being held at a refuge and not a commercial farm . six more cases of h5n1 have been confirmed among dead wild birds found on rügen , according to authorities in mecklenburg-western pomerania , the northern state of which the island is part .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .

"
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .

" the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .

another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .
" it 's a fitting conclusion to the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. motte alias matthias röingh brings the love the love parade will live again in the city that gave birth to it thanks to a cash injection from rainer schaller , owner of mcfit , germany 's largest fitness studio chain and the parade 's key corporate sponsor .
in recent years the parade was moved to austria , switzerland , britain , israel , south africa , mexico and san francisco . " the love parade is a german export hit .
this brand has achieved cult status and is known worldwide .
that this mega event should not take place in its homeland just because of financial problems was unacceptable for me , " said schaller . from a street party of hundreds to a parade of over a million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 1.5 million ravers turned up for the parade 's high point in 1999 beginning life as a street party for around 200 people in west berlin in 1989 , the party became a parade after the fall of the berlin wall .
after germany became one again , the parade expanded rapidly and became a symbol for berlin 's hip and revitalized image during the heady , euphoric days of the 1990s .
at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ... ' till dusk again ...
however , an economic " upper " is the only additive the organizers are likely to advocate .
" i think the love parade should be saying we think drugs are uncool , " dr motte told the press conference , adding that booths will be set up at the festival to educate the revelers about the negative effects of drugs . ravers at the parade often rely on stimulants to keep them dancing for days without interruption . dr. motte also said the festival 's organizers were discussing the security situation with german police and other authorities to assure that the party is as safe and orderly as possible . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade demise is test for techno berlin 's giant annual street party , the love parade , was cancelled for the second year in a row when sponsorship fell flat .
does the death of germany 's ultimate rave mean techno music has run its course ?
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .

at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ...

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion bird flu vaccine on the way ? germany -pipe- 23.02.2006 germany 's media tangle with bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the tv series " 24 " or a picture postcard from the german coast ?
the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.02.2006 germany pledges to further ties with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government under angela merkel hopes to develop close ties with china ending his three-nation tour of asia , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has met with chinese president hu jintao in beijing .
a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ...

" before opening the archives to researchers indiscriminately , questions of privacy and liability for the misuse of this sensitive data needs to be addressed , " a german foreign ministry spokesperson told the new york times . germany is coming under increased pressure from the us and holocaust historians to release the files , and , last year , 20 countries published a joint statement backing the us position and called for the urgent release of the documents to researchers . one american researcher has called the refusal to open the archive " a form of holocaust denial . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of holocaust victims and their fate are held in the archive the international tracing service , a branch of the international committee of the red cross that was established to help families discover what had happened to their relatives , holds the documents which were gathered by allied forces as they liberated nazi concentration camps in the final days of world war ii . secret programs and horrific experiments the documents detail horrific medical experiments and include files on alleged collaborators among concentration camp inmates . there is also comprehensive documentation on the lebensborn program , under which tens of thousands of children born to women in nazi-occupied countries and fathered by german soldiers were sent to special educational facilities , where they were raised to be part of the nazis ' so-called " master race .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .

at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ...

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. motte alias matthias röingh brings the love the love parade will live again in the city that gave birth to it thanks to a cash injection from rainer schaller , owner of mcfit , germany 's largest fitness studio chain and the parade 's key corporate sponsor .
in recent years the parade was moved to austria , switzerland , britain , israel , south africa , mexico and san francisco . " the love parade is a german export hit .
this brand has achieved cult status and is known worldwide .
that this mega event should not take place in its homeland just because of financial problems was unacceptable for me , " said schaller . from a street party of hundreds to a parade of over a million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 1.5 million ravers turned up for the parade 's high point in 1999 beginning life as a street party for around 200 people in west berlin in 1989 , the party became a parade after the fall of the berlin wall .
after germany became one again , the parade expanded rapidly and became a symbol for berlin 's hip and revitalized image during the heady , euphoric days of the 1990s .
at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ... ' till dusk again ...
however , an economic " upper " is the only additive the organizers are likely to advocate .
" i think the love parade should be saying we think drugs are uncool , " dr motte told the press conference , adding that booths will be set up at the festival to educate the revelers about the negative effects of drugs . ravers at the parade often rely on stimulants to keep them dancing for days without interruption . dr. motte also said the festival 's organizers were discussing the security situation with german police and other authorities to assure that the party is as safe and orderly as possible . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade demise is test for techno berlin 's giant annual street party , the love parade , was cancelled for the second year in a row when sponsorship fell flat .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .
" it 's a fitting conclusion to the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. motte alias matthias röingh brings the love the love parade will live again in the city that gave birth to it thanks to a cash injection from rainer schaller , owner of mcfit , germany 's largest fitness studio chain and the parade 's key corporate sponsor .
in recent years the parade was moved to austria , switzerland , britain , israel , south africa , mexico and san francisco . " the love parade is a german export hit .
this brand has achieved cult status and is known worldwide .
that this mega event should not take place in its homeland just because of financial problems was unacceptable for me , " said schaller . from a street party of hundreds to a parade of over a million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 1.5 million ravers turned up for the parade 's high point in 1999 beginning life as a street party for around 200 people in west berlin in 1989 , the party became a parade after the fall of the berlin wall .
after germany became one again , the parade expanded rapidly and became a symbol for berlin 's hip and revitalized image during the heady , euphoric days of the 1990s .
at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ... ' till dusk again ...
however , an economic " upper " is the only additive the organizers are likely to advocate .
" i think the love parade should be saying we think drugs are uncool , " dr motte told the press conference , adding that booths will be set up at the festival to educate the revelers about the negative effects of drugs . ravers at the parade often rely on stimulants to keep them dancing for days without interruption . dr. motte also said the festival 's organizers were discussing the security situation with german police and other authorities to assure that the party is as safe and orderly as possible . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade demise is test for techno berlin 's giant annual street party , the love parade , was cancelled for the second year in a row when sponsorship fell flat .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion bird flu vaccine on the way ? germany -pipe- 23.02.2006 germany 's media tangle with bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the tv series " 24 " or a picture postcard from the german coast ?
the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

" we believe the love parade is alive , " dr. motte , the pseudonym of love parade founder and organizer matthias röingh , told reporters at a news conference to announce the festival 's revival after a two-year hiatus .
" it 's a fitting conclusion to the world cup . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. motte alias matthias röingh brings the love the love parade will live again in the city that gave birth to it thanks to a cash injection from rainer schaller , owner of mcfit , germany 's largest fitness studio chain and the parade 's key corporate sponsor .
in recent years the parade was moved to austria , switzerland , britain , israel , south africa , mexico and san francisco . " the love parade is a german export hit .
this brand has achieved cult status and is known worldwide .
that this mega event should not take place in its homeland just because of financial problems was unacceptable for me , " said schaller . from a street party of hundreds to a parade of over a million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 1.5 million ravers turned up for the parade 's high point in 1999 beginning life as a street party for around 200 people in west berlin in 1989 , the party became a parade after the fall of the berlin wall .
after germany became one again , the parade expanded rapidly and became a symbol for berlin 's hip and revitalized image during the heady , euphoric days of the 1990s .
at its height , the parade attracted 1.5 million ravers . however , the event began to slip into financial trouble at the turn of the century after it lost its status as a demonstration in 2001 and was on the point of virtual collapse two years ago .
paying costs for services which it previously enjoyed for free , such as blocking off roads , relocating bus stops and cleaning up the massive amounts of rubbish left behind by party-goers , left the parade hemorrhaging cash . but now rainer schaller 's shot in the love parade arm will revive its flagging financial fortunes and get the show on the road once more . cash injection the only shot in the arm organizers support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from dusk ' till dawn ... ' till dusk again ...
however , an economic " upper " is the only additive the organizers are likely to advocate .
" i think the love parade should be saying we think drugs are uncool , " dr motte told the press conference , adding that booths will be set up at the festival to educate the revelers about the negative effects of drugs . ravers at the parade often rely on stimulants to keep them dancing for days without interruption . dr. motte also said the festival 's organizers were discussing the security situation with german police and other authorities to assure that the party is as safe and orderly as possible . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love parade demise is test for techno berlin 's giant annual street party , the love parade , was cancelled for the second year in a row when sponsorship fell flat .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces .

while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .

" germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

please be aware that drunken women will try to kiss you and that your tie may be in danger .
thank you for flying with lufthansa . " in the context of other security risks which threaten air passengers , it ranks way down on the list behind hijacking and shoe bombing .
and for some people , it may actually be the main reason for taking the flight in the first place . passengers on inbound flights to cologne and düsseldorf on thursday were warned over their aircraft 's public address system that they were in danger of being kissed as their flights neared their destination . this was not a sinister plot to spread some horrid disease through saliva - although some infection could not be ruled out . it was , however , a serious security announcement preparing those landing in germany 's carnival homeland that hoards of drunken and euphoric local women were on the look-out for willing - and unwilling - recipients of exuberant embraces . " women 's day " puts ties and lips in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrivals gate at cologne airport was particularly packed thursday to be on your guard on " altweiber " or " wieverfastelovend " is sound advice .
while most any day at the height of carnival celebrations can present unsuspecting visitors with a shock , the traditional " women ’ s day " can be a particularly raucous affair . in addition to the whole invasion of personal space and uninvited smooching , it 's a day when over-refreshed ladies stagger around the streets unhindered carrying scissors ; a practice which is as dangerous - to tie-wearers - as it sounds . tradition states that on women 's day , legions of females will storm the local town hall , pound down the door , snip off the mayor 's tie and take over . but it 's not just the mayor 's tie that is at risk , as lufthansa was at pains to stress .
" beware , women with scissors are after your tie , " another announcement informed passengers .
anyone is fair game .
protests that " this is my best armani " will go unheeded by the carnival cravat cutters . for those having second thoughts , many airlines operating out of cologne and düsseldorf are offering cheap getaway options from these very same cities . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carnival steers clear of religious topics carnival kicks off across germany this week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .
the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest . " as a veto-wielding permanent member of the united nations security council , china 's role in the iranian nuclear crisis is crucial . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china promises to do more to stem copyright infringement following talks wednesday , germany 's foreign minister said he extracted a pledge from china to get tougher on copyright infringement .

" germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china .

the iaea meets on march 6 to discuss the standoff .
china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday . " this is a working visit to iran for political consultations between the two foreign ministries , " liu said . " he will make an exchange of views with iran on bilateral relations , the nuclear issue and other issues of common interest .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia .

" before opening the archives to researchers indiscriminately , questions of privacy and liability for the misuse of this sensitive data needs to be addressed , " a german foreign ministry spokesperson told the new york times . germany is coming under increased pressure from the us and holocaust historians to release the files , and , last year , 20 countries published a joint statement backing the us position and called for the urgent release of the documents to researchers . one american researcher has called the refusal to open the archive " a form of holocaust denial . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : details of holocaust victims and their fate are held in the archive the international tracing service , a branch of the international committee of the red cross that was established to help families discover what had happened to their relatives , holds the documents which were gathered by allied forces as they liberated nazi concentration camps in the final days of world war ii . secret programs and horrific experiments the documents detail horrific medical experiments and include files on alleged collaborators among concentration camp inmates . there is also comprehensive documentation on the lebensborn program , under which tens of thousands of children born to women in nazi-occupied countries and fathered by german soldiers were sent to special educational facilities , where they were raised to be part of the nazis ' so-called " master race .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .

" the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .

another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .

" steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .

" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims .

there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .

and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

the media is liable to exaggerate the danger presented by bird flu to increase newspaper circulation and tv quotas .
media experts warn that inflammatory reports can provoke irrational reactions . german newspaper headlines have been offering readers various horror scenarios when it comes to the spread of avian influenza .
the most widely circulated german newspaper bild was , as usual , louder than most on wednesday .
with " bird flu - world cup cancelled ? " stamped across the cover page , bild put a cherry on top of a week-long feast of sensationalist reporting , which included headlines like : " fear on the rise , " " house pets soon to be killed ? "
" virus alarm , " " enough medication for every seventh german , " " no flu vaccines left , " and " … millions to die of bird flu ? " . " the media have succumbed to bird flu at the moment : they are more sick than the birds themselves , " said sociologist willi streitz of the disaster research center at the university of kiel .
" one often has the impression that journalists make up their headlines out of thin air , and then look for experts who would support their claims . " headlines more important than research bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors of german dailies know that shocking headlines sell more papers reports about bird flu often overlook the fact that the probability of infection is extremely low .
there have been only 170 known cases around the world , and 91 people have died .
the soccer world cup would be cancelled only if a flu epidemic broke out , for which the virus would have to mutate and start spreading from person to person .
but that 's the small print that bild readers would have only found on page eight - if they looked that far . " reports often do not differentiate between the potential danger of a pandemic and the advance of the virus , " said winfried göpfert , an expert for scientific journalism at the freie university in berlin .
but tabloids , such as bild are n't the only culprits .
many newspapers have printed headlines , such as " bird flu in germany , " which have created an impression that people are in danger , too , göpfert said . fear and horror " the serious media fall under the strong influence of the tabloids to exaggerate things which horrify their readers , although there is absolutely no reason for that , " said stephan russ-mohl , director of the european journalism observatory -lrb- ejo -rrb- in lugano , switzerland .
" through mere quantity , the topic gains in importance to the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for dead birds and new headlines serious newspapers , like the conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitug , have devoted page after page to the bird flu .
and in many newspapers , the images used to illustrate the articles have frequently appeared to contradict the texts , russ-mohl said .
" millions of pictures of people in protective clothing have been published , which suggests a great danger of contamination . " he pointed out that when there 's little news to report , editors face the task of making something of less significant topics .
" even in difficult editorial working conditions , one should think about whether one is spreading fear , " russ-mohl said . risk is a risky business risk is always - relative to the probability of occurrence and scope of possible danger - fundamentally newsworthy , according to georg ruhrmann , who researches risk communication at the university of jena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images are often more shocking than the news being reported " when journalists report about risks , they usually add an additional one on top : the uncertain becomes even more uncertain , the spectacular even more spectacular , and the damage even more catastrophic , " said ruhrmann . whether it 's terrorism , food scandals or crime , the last 10 years have seen an increased presence of topics that frighten people , above all on privately-owned , commercial tv channels , he said . " the population is infected with frightening topics , but before they can really work through them , journalists are already writing about something else , " ruhrmann criticized .
" and then you 're left more scared of the bird flu than of crossing the street , although the latter is actually more risky . " irrational reactions usually , a frightening topic is pursued for a limited period of time without creating permanent attitude changes , he said .
a case in point is the aids epidemic .
with fewer and fewer reports covering aids , the practice of unprotected sex actually increased , even though the infection risk remained the same .
warnings can under certain circumstances turn into hysteria , clarification into stupidity .
the falling sales of poultry show that the reports of the bird flu can lead to irrational reactions , ruhrmann said . but göpfert of the freie university said reporting on bird flu has performed an important role in putting the pressure on the authorities to prepare for the realistic possibility of a pandemic . sociologist streitz , on the other hand , said that the media are slowly entering a " phase of reflection . " " in the beginning , everybody rushes to write about it , which then develops its own dynamics , " streitz said .
but he said he did n't see the bird flu reports as " creating panic . " " people are usually level-headed .
you really have to try very hard to create real panic .

a number of controversial issues were on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said thursday the new government of chancellor angela merkel hoped to develop closer ties with china . " germany 's new government aims to push forward the existing wide-ranging and close cooperative relations between the two nations , " steinmeier told chinese president hu jintao in a meeting thursday , according to xinhua news agency . the meeting , in the great hall of the people , was the diplomatic highpoint of steinmeier ’ s two-day visit to the chinese capital , after previous stopovers in japan and south korea .
the german foreign minister is the first merkel cabinet member to travel to china .
merkel herself will be visiting china in may . high-speed train question still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would like to build a second transrapid line in china hu told steinmeier that sino-german relations were " based on a firm political foundation " and he also hoped ties would expand , especially in economics and trade . " china hopes to make common efforts with germany to further develop and deepen comprehensive relations , " hu was quoted as saying . yet the problem of product and intellectual property piracy featured prominently in talks with president hu , veering unexpectedly into the limelight after china said last week that it had developed its own version of germany ’ s transrapid high-speed magnetic levitation train .
beijing claims it has not used patented german technology .
germany is hoping to participate in a new transrapid line from shanghai to hanzhou . " the president said that extending the transrapid line was viewed very positively in the government , but that no final decision had been made , " steinmeier said . human rights still a concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier touched upon several controversial issues with his chinese colleagues steinmeier also said his visit with hu was meant to underscore the continuation of germany ’ s close relationship to china .
he announced that there would be a round of scientific discussions to draft a formal sino-german partnership accord . steinmeier tackled a touchy subject , saying germans were concerned about china ’ s human rights record .
referring to licensing deals by the web search engines , google and yahoo , to block certain content , the foreign minister said the issue of internet censorship was a big concern .
but , gu xuewu , a chinese political science professor at bochum university in germany , was skeptical about whether beijing would let outsiders influence its policies . " i don ’ t think the chinese would ever allow the germans to interfere , " gu said . " they know german leaders have to mention human rights when they visit because of the public back home , but i have my doubts that german efforts to raise the issue will have any effect on china . " diplomacy first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao on the subject of iran and its controversial nuclear program , chinese leaders said there was still room to resolve the dispute within the international atomic energy agency and appealed for more negotiations .

china is one of iran ’ s biggest oil export markets . in an apparent change of policy , however , steinmeier told hu that germany would no longer be taking the lead , as former chancellor gerhard schröder had done , in prodding the european union to scrap its weapons embargo against china .
that embargo was imposed after the 1989 tiananmen massacre in beijing . the two sides agreed that angela merkel would pay her first visit to china as german chancellor in may .
her spokesman in berlin said on thursday that the visit would take place from may 21-23 . schröder visited china six times in his seven years in office , normally accompanied by a large delegation of german business executives . china to help with iran in a separate development , china announced it would send its deputy foreign minister to tehran on friday to discuss the crisis over iran 's nuclear program . li guozeng will visit for three days to discuss the nuclear issue and other issues of interest to the two countries , foreign ministry spokesman liu jianchao told journalists at a regular briefing on thursday .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

" the defendant should be investigated for inciting racial hatred , defiling the dead and denying the holocaust .
he should also be investigated according to international conventions and international law for violating the rights of jews to security , to life and to freedom , " the indictment says . punishable offence " the charges are based on german law from 1993 against racial hatred and holocaust denial , " shahar told dw-radio . shahar , who heads up the suit , filed the indictment on behalf of the civil coalition , which he describes as " an ngo active in israel and the world , dealing with human rights internally and externally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the holocaust is a historical fact although ahmadinejad has not publicly denied the holocaust on german soil , shahar argues in his indictment that there are firm legal grounds for bringing charges in germany , where denial of the holocaust is a crime punishable with up to five years in prison . " the federal court in germany has repeatedly declared that the holocaust is a fact , that holocaust denial is considered a lie and as such , has no legal defense on the basis of freedom of speech , " shahar stressed . " our goal is to make a point - to make clear that a person who denies the holocaust , threatens others and infringes their civil and political rights has no place in the civilized world , " shahar said .
" i think we 've achieved this goal . " an investigation expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court " the crime as described is directly linked to germany , committed among others - against german nationals of jewish descent , so it is expected that the federal prosecutor will decide to prosecute , " he told reuters . but first , the prosecutors will have to assess legal questions like jurisdiction , possible immunity from prosecution and whether ahmadinejad could be tried in absentia . " we do n't expect an immediate response , " said shahar .

but how , when the nation is feeling the pinch of austerity , can its opera houses stay alive ? for those brought up on the belief that opera is an elite form of entertainment accessible only to society grande dames and their aristocratic entourages , it might come as something of a surprise to learn that germany is home to some 90 opera houses .
and many are in eastern germany , which is more frequently equated with economic crisis and unemployment than high-brow culture .
indeed a trip around germany 's most eastern reaches reveals that parts of the country are as bleak and depressed as the economic pundits would have us believe .
but by the same token , many towns and cities are also home to spectacular opera houses , which appear untouched by the tumultuous events of the past decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemnitz 's opera feels the pinch of fewer inhabitants bernhard helmich , who is poised to become the new director general of the opera in the town of chemnitz , says that ultimately local unemployment rates have little bearing on the fate of an opera house . " the problems in towns like chemnitz are no different to those in richer german towns , because at the end of the day , those who go to the opera are generally not those who are affected by poverty , " helmich said , adding that pricing scales in most opera houses cater to all purses .
" what is a problem for us is the fact that towns are getting smaller . " shrinking populations , local competition of that , chemnitz - the last town of any significance before the czech border - is a prime example .
since emerging from behind the iron curtain , it has shrunk by almost 50 percent and is now home to just over 200,000 inhabitants .
the fact that there are fewer people to fill the same number of seats coupled with the constant threat of public spending cuts has the power to influence which performances the different houses are prepared to put their names to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eastern city of erfurt invested in a modern opera house a recent study conducted by the german association of theater and orchestras found that " more and more opera houses see no alternative but to cut back their programs and avoid any commercial risks in repertoire planning . "
another competitive factor is that there are simply so many opera houses in spitting distance of each other . helmich said that although there is definite competition between the houses , people tend to identify closely with their local ensembles .
" people come to hear the singers of their town .
they want to see their tenors , their bass , their dancers , " he said .
" they do n't want to hear outsiders , even if they are better . " the director for the association of theater and orchestras , rolf bolwin , believes the traditional notion behind opera in germany was to be able to offer culture to the locals .
" opera should be for the townspeople .
an opera house in leipzig is of no use to the inhabitants of chemnitz . " steeped in tradition and although there is evidence to suggest that the number of people taking advantage of the local and national palette of performances has fallen over the past 15 years , some 8 million viewers turned out to watch operas , operettas , musicals and ballets in germany last season .
bolwin says there is no escaping the fact that " music theater plays a big role for germans . " the tradition , which grew up in the 17th century in the small princedoms of germany , has partly been so successful at surviving because it has played a role in the social discourse of the german nation .
helmich says it is astonishing that there are still so many people who remain true to opera .
" the fact that closure plans always meet with such hefty protests proves that germans respect educational and historical theater . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of the past in richard strauss ' " rosenkavalier " since it became an accessible source of entertainment , opera has had to stave off ever more competition from the world of modern media , but as bolwin points out , the likes of television , film and even the internet have not rendered it redundant .
" opera has survived all kinds of competition because unlike a screen , it is based on direct communication between people , " he said . bolwin is determined to see the tradition of that communication live on to fight the next generations of electronica . " changes will continue , but we must aim to mobilize all our energies to keep one of the greatest opera landscapes of the world alive .

in a letter to the government , 36 clinicians say the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- is ignoring patients ' needs .
they say the treatments , temozolomide and carmustine implants , are a major advance , and value for money .
nice initially rejected them - but said no final decision had been made . "
these treatments are the biggest breakthroughs in treating brain tumours in 30 years " professor roy rampling the therapies are designed to treat a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer called a high-grade glioma .
it has been estimated that temozolomide alone could potentially benefit 800 patients a year in the uk .
the move will intensify the debate over whether it is right to deny potentially beneficial treatments to nhs patients .
mrs hewitt has intervened in a row about access to nhs drugs once before , asking to see the evidence upon which a primary care trust had decided to deny the breast cancer treatment herceptin to a woman in staffordshire .
following her intervention , north stoke primary care trust reversed its decision .

nice is due to begin its final assessment of the glioma treatments at the end of the month .
however , a preliminary recommendation from the nice appraisal committee concluded that the treatments should not be widely used for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas .
in their letter to mrs hewitt , the consultants and specialists say the committee has failed to grasp the complexities of what they say is a particularly specialised area .
professor roy rampling , an expert in brain tumours based at the western infirmary in glasgow , said : " these treatments are the biggest breakthroughs in treating brain tumours in 30 years , and are standard care in many other developed countries .
" nice is ignoring the evidence - and the needs of patients who are diagnosed with a rapidly fatal illness . "
the letter calls on nice to withdraw its current recommendation , and for mrs hewitt to ensure that the treatments are available for all brain tumours who would benefit from them .
it argues that if the drugs are not made widely available then it will make it more difficult to achieve targets set out in the government 's cancer plan .
little hope professor rampling said : " nice simply is n't doing its job properly .
high grade glioma annually there are around 3,500 new cases of brain tumour in england and wales they are classified from grade i -lrb- slow growing and benign -rrb- to grade iv -lrb- fastest growing -rrb- grade iii and iv tumours , which account for 50 % -60 % of all primary brain tumours , are classed as high-grade gliomas there are several types , all of which are associated with severe disability , and a high risk of death " telling patients they have a malignant brain tumour is a difficult thing to do ; we now might be in the invidious position of explaining that there are treatments available , but the flawed decision by nice means their chances of getting them on the nhs are pretty much zero . "
a consortium of brain tumour organisations , including brain tumour uk , the samantha dickson research trust and the international brain tumour alliance , are also campaigning for improved access to the drugs .
angela dickson , a spokesperson for the consortium , said : " we 're the ones who get calls from patients asking what to do when they 've been told there 's no funding for drugs which can increase their life span and slow the progress of their tumours .
" the current system is unfair and unacceptable . "
in a statement , nice said all representations would be considered before final guidance was issued .
it stressed there was no ban on prescribing licensed drugs that have not yet been appraised .
a department of health spokesperson said : " nice is an independent body and we trust them to produce clinical and cost effective guidance to the nhs based on the latest available evidence . "

in their letter to mrs hewitt , the consultants and specialists say the committee has failed to grasp the complexities of what they say is a particularly specialised area .
professor roy rampling , an expert in brain tumours based at the western infirmary in glasgow , said : " these treatments are the biggest breakthroughs in treating brain tumours in 30 years , and are standard care in many other developed countries .

the letter calls on nice to withdraw its current recommendation , and for mrs hewitt to ensure that the treatments are available for all brain tumours who would benefit from them .

it stressed there was no ban on prescribing licensed drugs that have not yet been appraised .
a department of health spokesperson said : " nice is an independent body and we trust them to produce clinical and cost effective guidance to the nhs based on the latest available evidence . "

australian firm multiplex , which is behind schedule on the giant london project , admitted the losses were " extremely disappointing " .
they contributed to an overall loss of £ 50m for the six months to 31 december .
earlier this week england 's football association said wembley would not be ready for may 's fa cup final .
the game will instead now be played at cardiff 's millennium stadium .
daily penalties multiplex chief executive andrew roberts insisted on thursday morning that the company did not expect any further wembley losses beyond the £ 106m .
the outlook for the -lrb- construction -rrb- division remains strong within both australia and internationally , following continued success in securing profitable new work multiplex it said the figure - amounting to £ 120,000 a day since 31 january - included all the penalty payments it is liable to pay for not completing the stadium on time .
the company said factors delaying wembley 's completion included subcontractors ' performance , changes in design , relations with trade unions for those working on the site and the weather .
however , multiplex insists there is no prospect of it going bankrupt and leaving the stadium unfinished .
it said it was " disappointed " by the fa 's decision to move the final .
fixed-price contract " nothing has changed since the end of january , when we said there was a 70 % chance of the stadium being ready for the 2006 fa cup final , " a multiplex spokesperson said this week .
" we were not able to increase this to 100 % , so the fa decided to make alternative arrangements . "
multiplex agreed a fixed-price contract of £ 445m to build wembley stadium - with the project set to cost the fa £ 757m in total .
difficulties with the redevelopment of the 90,000-seat stadium prompted the resignation of multiplex founder and executive chairman john roberts in may as the group blamed " cost blow-outs " for the spiralling cost of the stadium .
rising revenues despite the £ 50m first half loss , which compares to a slight £ 5m profit for the same period 12 months previously , multiplex said it remained on target to make a full year profit of £ 50m .
its group-wide revenues for the first half rose 9.6 % to £ 730m .
apart from wembley , multiplex said its construction division remained strong , with 41 of its other 42 current projects achieving expected margins .

the french authorities had issued an international warrant for his arrest after he had left the country .
victim ilan halimi died after being found naked , bound and gagged in a crime that shocked france .
the 23-year-old man had been held for ransom for three weeks .
he was dumped near the sainte-genevieve-des-bois train station near paris on 13 february , and found lying in agony with horrific injuries to his body .
he died on the way to hospital .

shin is suspected of having abducted yasushi chimura and fukie hamamoto in western japan in july 1978 , while choe is thought to have abducted kaoru hasuike and yukiko okudo from northern japan at about the same time .

mr hara 's whereabouts are still unknown .
mr abe said that the japanese government would ask the international police agency interpol to list the two north koreans on a wanted list .

however , centrica said the profit rise came largely from its gas production and storage business .
profits at its british gas business fell 63 % to £ 90m after it delayed passing on the full impact of higher wholesale gas prices to customers .
last week british gas raised prices by 22 % , blaming a 70 % rise in wholesale gas prices over the past 12 months .
the british gas business reported a loss of £ 75m in the second half of the year .
centrica 's gas production operations saw annual operating profits rise 31 % to £ 1bn , and its gas storage business saw profits more than double to £ 154m .

" so what we are really getting is not next year 's prices , but last year 's prices reflected in the retail price now . "
the good news for customers was that centrica said improved wholesale gas supplies could protect consumers from further price rises in 2006 .
" while there can be no guarantees in such a volatile wholesale market we hope to avoid any need for further price rises this year , " it said .
centrica 's figures also showed that british gas had a net loss of more than 600,000 customers last year , with its market share falling from 57 % to 54 % as customers switched to other suppliers .
centrica 's shares fell 3.5 % to 285.75 pence as investors worried about the sharp fall in retail gas profits .

by nick triggle bbc news health reporter doubts are being raised about the future of hospitals which are being built using private money .
billions of pounds have been spent on pfi projects to date , but many more are still in the pipeline .
is the rug set to be pulled from beneath their feet ?
patricia hewitt is set to make a decision on the barts pfi scheme soon sitting somewhere in health secretary patricia hewitt 's in-tray are documents on the future of england 's oldest hospital .
the £ 1.15bn plan to refurbish st bartholomew 's hospital and its near neighbour in east london , the royal london , was supposed to have been signed off last year .
but the doctors and officials at the hospitals are not the only ones on tenterhooks waiting for a decision .
if the health secretary puts the brakes on the pfi scheme , under which private companies build hospitals with nhs trusts repaying them over 25 to 40 years , it would raise serious doubts about the future of the other 47 in the pipeline .
already a handful of other schemes are reaching critical points and are set to undergo reviews .
ms hewitt and her officials are looking at whether the barts and the london scheme is affordable - an independent review has already established there is a need for the services .
finances officials at the nhs trust believe they may be a victim of the wider problems gripping the nhs - one in four trusts failed to balance the books last year .
a spokeswoman said : " our scheme has been costed and is affordable .
we do not understand why there is a delay . "
however , concerns have been raised that under payment by results - a new system of funding being rolled out whereby hospitals are paid per patient treated rather than given a lump sum based on past activity - nhs trusts may struggle to meet the costs of pfi .
coupled with that , is the historic shift in care from hospitals to community services , such as super gp surgeries and outreach clinics , set out by a white paper last month , which will mean there is less work for hospitals to do .
bart 's hospital is the oldest in the country chris ham , a former department of health adviser and professor of health policy at birmingham university , believes the projects nearing closure may be unsustainable in the current environment .
" payment by results does not reflect capital outlay and we also have this movement away from hospitals .
things have to change .
" either we will have less new hospitals , the same number but on a smaller scale or a new system of funding needs to be designed to cover pfi costs but that could be unfair on other hospitals . "
and despite no decision on the barts and the london scheme , the signs are that some of the predictions are coming true .
in december , the queen elizabeth hospital in woolwich declared itself technically bankrupt , citing pfi .
the plymouth hospitals vanguard pfi project , a £ 600m scheme to build a care centre for non-emergency patients and redevelop the derriford hospital , has already announced it will review the extension plans for the derriford .
infrastructure and the building of a £ 500m hospital in birmingham has stalled as nhs managers await the government go-ahead despite £ 6m having already being invested in new roads and other infrastructure .
but there are also a host of other schemes waiting to sign deals with private sector partners that are being caught up in the logjam .
regional health bosses are due to carry out reviews in the coming months into the value for money , affordability and need for about a half a dozen projects .
the department for health insists there is no problem , pointing out there was between £ 7bn and £ 9bn being invested in forthcoming hospital pfis .
a spokesman said " the government 's commitment to investment in health has not changed .
it is extremely important that those schemes that are close to completion are not jeopardised by a panic reaction nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation " schemes have not been left in limbo , we are currently applying the checks and balances announced in the operating manual to the business cases for projects approaching financial close . "
but the industry remains unconvinced .
jonathan hills , manager of the ppp forum , the private sector lobby group , said there seemed to have been a change in tact as the projects in the pipeline amounted to about £ 12bn - at least £ 3bn more than the government was now saying .
" something has to give , " he added .

by nick triggle bbc news health reporter doubts are being raised about the future of hospitals which are being built using private money .
billions of pounds have been spent on pfi projects to date , but many more are still in the pipeline .
is the rug set to be pulled from beneath their feet ?
patricia hewitt is set to make a decision on the barts pfi scheme soon sitting somewhere in health secretary patricia hewitt 's in-tray are documents on the future of england 's oldest hospital .
the £ 1.15bn plan to refurbish st bartholomew 's hospital and its near neighbour in east london , the royal london , was supposed to have been signed off last year .
but the doctors and officials at the hospitals are not the only ones on tenterhooks waiting for a decision .
if the health secretary puts the brakes on the pfi scheme , under which private companies build hospitals with nhs trusts repaying them over 25 to 40 years , it would raise serious doubts about the future of the other 47 in the pipeline .
already a handful of other schemes are reaching critical points and are set to undergo reviews .
ms hewitt and her officials are looking at whether the barts and the london scheme is affordable - an independent review has already established there is a need for the services .
finances officials at the nhs trust believe they may be a victim of the wider problems gripping the nhs - one in four trusts failed to balance the books last year .
a spokeswoman said : " our scheme has been costed and is affordable .
we do not understand why there is a delay . "
however , concerns have been raised that under payment by results - a new system of funding being rolled out whereby hospitals are paid per patient treated rather than given a lump sum based on past activity - nhs trusts may struggle to meet the costs of pfi .
coupled with that , is the historic shift in care from hospitals to community services , such as super gp surgeries and outreach clinics , set out by a white paper last month , which will mean there is less work for hospitals to do .
bart 's hospital is the oldest in the country chris ham , a former department of health adviser and professor of health policy at birmingham university , believes the projects nearing closure may be unsustainable in the current environment .
" payment by results does not reflect capital outlay and we also have this movement away from hospitals .
things have to change .
" either we will have less new hospitals , the same number but on a smaller scale or a new system of funding needs to be designed to cover pfi costs but that could be unfair on other hospitals . "
and despite no decision on the barts and the london scheme , the signs are that some of the predictions are coming true .
in december , the queen elizabeth hospital in woolwich declared itself technically bankrupt , citing pfi .
the plymouth hospitals vanguard pfi project , a £ 600m scheme to build a care centre for non-emergency patients and redevelop the derriford hospital , has already announced it will review the extension plans for the derriford .
infrastructure and the building of a £ 500m hospital in birmingham has stalled as nhs managers await the government go-ahead despite £ 6m having already being invested in new roads and other infrastructure .
but there are also a host of other schemes waiting to sign deals with private sector partners that are being caught up in the logjam .
regional health bosses are due to carry out reviews in the coming months into the value for money , affordability and need for about a half a dozen projects .
the department for health insists there is no problem , pointing out there was between £ 7bn and £ 9bn being invested in forthcoming hospital pfis .
a spokesman said " the government 's commitment to investment in health has not changed .
it is extremely important that those schemes that are close to completion are not jeopardised by a panic reaction nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation " schemes have not been left in limbo , we are currently applying the checks and balances announced in the operating manual to the business cases for projects approaching financial close . "
but the industry remains unconvinced .
jonathan hills , manager of the ppp forum , the private sector lobby group , said there seemed to have been a change in tact as the projects in the pipeline amounted to about £ 12bn - at least £ 3bn more than the government was now saying .
" something has to give , " he added .

by nick triggle bbc news health reporter doubts are being raised about the future of hospitals which are being built using private money .
billions of pounds have been spent on pfi projects to date , but many more are still in the pipeline .
is the rug set to be pulled from beneath their feet ?
patricia hewitt is set to make a decision on the barts pfi scheme soon sitting somewhere in health secretary patricia hewitt 's in-tray are documents on the future of england 's oldest hospital .
the £ 1.15bn plan to refurbish st bartholomew 's hospital and its near neighbour in east london , the royal london , was supposed to have been signed off last year .
but the doctors and officials at the hospitals are not the only ones on tenterhooks waiting for a decision .
if the health secretary puts the brakes on the pfi scheme , under which private companies build hospitals with nhs trusts repaying them over 25 to 40 years , it would raise serious doubts about the future of the other 47 in the pipeline .
already a handful of other schemes are reaching critical points and are set to undergo reviews .
ms hewitt and her officials are looking at whether the barts and the london scheme is affordable - an independent review has already established there is a need for the services .
finances officials at the nhs trust believe they may be a victim of the wider problems gripping the nhs - one in four trusts failed to balance the books last year .
a spokeswoman said : " our scheme has been costed and is affordable .
we do not understand why there is a delay . "
however , concerns have been raised that under payment by results - a new system of funding being rolled out whereby hospitals are paid per patient treated rather than given a lump sum based on past activity - nhs trusts may struggle to meet the costs of pfi .
coupled with that , is the historic shift in care from hospitals to community services , such as super gp surgeries and outreach clinics , set out by a white paper last month , which will mean there is less work for hospitals to do .
bart 's hospital is the oldest in the country chris ham , a former department of health adviser and professor of health policy at birmingham university , believes the projects nearing closure may be unsustainable in the current environment .
" payment by results does not reflect capital outlay and we also have this movement away from hospitals .
things have to change .
" either we will have less new hospitals , the same number but on a smaller scale or a new system of funding needs to be designed to cover pfi costs but that could be unfair on other hospitals . "
and despite no decision on the barts and the london scheme , the signs are that some of the predictions are coming true .
in december , the queen elizabeth hospital in woolwich declared itself technically bankrupt , citing pfi .
the plymouth hospitals vanguard pfi project , a £ 600m scheme to build a care centre for non-emergency patients and redevelop the derriford hospital , has already announced it will review the extension plans for the derriford .
infrastructure and the building of a £ 500m hospital in birmingham has stalled as nhs managers await the government go-ahead despite £ 6m having already being invested in new roads and other infrastructure .
but there are also a host of other schemes waiting to sign deals with private sector partners that are being caught up in the logjam .
regional health bosses are due to carry out reviews in the coming months into the value for money , affordability and need for about a half a dozen projects .
the department for health insists there is no problem , pointing out there was between £ 7bn and £ 9bn being invested in forthcoming hospital pfis .
a spokesman said " the government 's commitment to investment in health has not changed .
it is extremely important that those schemes that are close to completion are not jeopardised by a panic reaction nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation " schemes have not been left in limbo , we are currently applying the checks and balances announced in the operating manual to the business cases for projects approaching financial close . "
but the industry remains unconvinced .
jonathan hills , manager of the ppp forum , the private sector lobby group , said there seemed to have been a change in tact as the projects in the pipeline amounted to about £ 12bn - at least £ 3bn more than the government was now saying .
" something has to give , " he added .
one director of a pfi project , which is at a much earlier stage to the trusts facing reviews , told the bbc that the major problem was the goalposts had changed .
" many of these scheme were conceived before we had heard of payment by results and the white paper .
" whereas we have had to factor these in all along and have had scrutiny of our plans that reflect that , some of the schemes that are further advanced have not .
this could cause a problem . "
but nigel edwards , director of policy at the nhs confederation , which represents health service managers , said while there was a problem with the new funding system and services were being directed more towards the community , there was still a need for the hospitals .
he warned : " it is extremely important that those schemes that are close to completion are not jeopardised by a panic reaction to the review of a few high profile projects or the recently announced wider assessment of all pfi schemes . "
