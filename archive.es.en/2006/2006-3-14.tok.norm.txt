a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet . the world is again being seized by gold fever .
over the course of the past five years , the price of bullion has doubled .
the current value of some $ 550 -lrb- 462 euros -rrb- for one troy ounce is not even close to the all-time highs of the early 1980s .
but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .
the deutsche mark became the favored currency on the continent - until 2002 . diminished responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death knell for the german mark - the euro when the euro was brought into circulation in its metal and paper form on jan .
1 , 2002 , the bundesbank suddenly lost it primary responsibilities - the minting of coinage and bills , circulation and fiscal duties .
overnight , the frankfurt-based institution became a veritable equal among all the other central banks of the euro zone .
the center of monetary power shifted within germany 's financial capital to the european central bank , whose modern headquarters far outshined those of the old german mark managers . but the bundesbank is still responsible for the gold reserves that are currently worth some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- .
bank president axel weber has repeatedly rejected calls from politicians in berlin to be more generous with the gold reserves and has not responded positively to possible legislation that might force his hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber -lrb- l -rrb- also had gold talks with former finance minister hans eichel " we are not pursuing a change of the current law , " he said in an interview with dow jones news published on the bundesbank web site .
if the law is amended then it is " mandatory , that our autonomy with regard to politically-related currency decisions and the management of the -lrb- gold -rrb- reserves not be touched . " special status gone with grand coalition members of germany 's ruling parties have accused the bundesbank of acting improperly .
in the financial times deutschland , social democratic parliamentarian joachim poss last month called the bank board members " vain " and " stubborn . " christian democratic parliamentarian and budget committee member steffen kampeter was more diplomatic in his assessment of the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardians of the euro - the ecb headquarters in frankfurt " we have to ask ourselves , and the bank must ask itself , just how many gold reserves are necessary for a central bank that no longer manages a single currency , " kampeter said .
" it would be smart to think of other reserve alternatives , such as other currencies . " gold analyst philip klapwijk from gfms in london agreed with those sentiments . " given that over 50 percent of the bundesbank 's foreign reserves are in gold -lrb- valued at market prices -rrb- , there is a case for reserve diversification , " he said .
" studies show that some gold in the portfolio does improve risk adjusted returns but the current holdings of the bundesbank are excessive for this purpose . " just how many assets should the government sell ? officially , bundesbank chief weber has argued that the bank 's independence can not and should not be violated .
its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "

its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy .

" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant inflatable dinosaur with a car and a factory in its jaws was set up in front of the european council headquarters where the meeting was held on tuesday " at this stage , it 's not a formal negotiation aimed at coming up with any precise result , " his spokesman explained on tuesday .
moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .

governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't gotten this bad - yet but the idea was rejected out of hand by the states ' chief negotiator , lower saxony state finance minister hartmut möllring of merkel 's christian democrats , who demanded a return to the negotiating table without the intervention of third parties .
governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .
the state prosecutor in munich is also investigating the case after al-masri brought charges against the german authorities . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german seized by cia says he feared for his life as khaled el masri 's lawyers continue to probe his claims of wrongful abduction and detention at the hands of the cia , the lebanese-born german spoke out about his ordeal .

they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .

france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .

" dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .

the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .

the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .
if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .

" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .

" we are making good on our promise to provide a service-oriented and non-bureaucratic solution , " horst r. schmidt , the ok vice president , said in a statement in reference to complaints regarding the red-tape surrounding ticket allocation , returns and swaps .
" however , we expect that 99 percent of all ticket holders will make use of their tickets and go to the stadium themselves , and the ticket portal will only be in place for exceptional cases . " considering how hard it has been to get hold of the tickets , he could be right .
those fans who really ca n't make it to the world cup , however , will have the chance to make sure the tickets are used and know that the effort to obtain them was n't a waste . but in true ok and fifa style , the process is not exactly easy .
for those fans selling the tickets back to the ok to resell or transferring tickets to a named recipient , the applicant must go through an online form in the customer self-service section . tickets can be resold and redistributed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking out the ticket exchange online customers who want to put their tickets up for resale can do so by following the instructions in the appropriate area of the site , without providing any reasons for the return . once a purchase request for the specific ticket is made , the seller gets back the price he paid for the ticket in the first place .
for the original ticket holder , the resale is free of any fees . released tickets will be offered in the resale for face value plus an additional administrative fee of up to 15 percent of the face value but which may not exceed the maximum amount of 15 euros -lrb- $ 17.86 -rrb- . for those wanting to transfer tickets to another fan , a set of criteria must first be met . the ok and fifa have set out seven possibilities for transfer : transfer within the family and partnerships illness of ticket holder / visitor ticket holder or visitor get no visa to travel to germany ticket holder or visitor is prohibited from traveling force majeure -lrb- e.g. acts of war , earthquake , terrorism , political upheavals , epidemics , natural catastrophes -rrb- death of ticket holder or visitor or case of death within the family of ticket holder / visitor hardship case even if the reason for the ticket exchange fits any of these seven points , further documentation may still be required . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only deals done over the portal will be legal the ok has made it clear that tickets may only be returned or transferred to another person through the official channels on the portal and may not be exchanged directly between two customers online without ok consent .
any person transferring a ticket will be liable to a 10 euro fee . " this ticket portal is a platform intended to fight back against the black market and , at the same time , it takes into account the high security requirements of the fifa world cup , " schmidt said , adding that the conditions left no acceptable or justifiable reason to sell or purchase tickets via other channels . the portal will be opened in two time windows .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .

" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .

moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability . " when you talk about energy security without security of demand you are talking about an abstract problem , " said alexander medvedev .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .

she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .

it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .

governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end .

" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .

the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .

governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end .

" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .

" möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the spd 's platzeck are n't smiling now verdi opposes state plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without additional pay .
employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant inflatable dinosaur with a car and a factory in its jaws was set up in front of the european council headquarters where the meeting was held on tuesday " at this stage , it 's not a formal negotiation aimed at coming up with any precise result , " his spokesman explained on tuesday .
moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability . " when you talk about energy security without security of demand you are talking about an abstract problem , " said alexander medvedev .

now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatians are skeptical about the eu , though they 're likely to be the next to join southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown . in 2004 , the european union absorbed 10 new members , mostly from the former eastern bloc .
now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .

merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .

" dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .

a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .

over the course of the past five years , the price of bullion has doubled .
the current value of some $ 550 -lrb- 462 euros -rrb- for one troy ounce is not even close to the all-time highs of the early 1980s .
but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .

the center of monetary power shifted within germany 's financial capital to the european central bank , whose modern headquarters far outshined those of the old german mark managers . but the bundesbank is still responsible for the gold reserves that are currently worth some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- .
bank president axel weber has repeatedly rejected calls from politicians in berlin to be more generous with the gold reserves and has not responded positively to possible legislation that might force his hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber -lrb- l -rrb- also had gold talks with former finance minister hans eichel " we are not pursuing a change of the current law , " he said in an interview with dow jones news published on the bundesbank web site .

" special status gone with grand coalition members of germany 's ruling parties have accused the bundesbank of acting improperly .

" given that over 50 percent of the bundesbank 's foreign reserves are in gold -lrb- valued at market prices -rrb- , there is a case for reserve diversification , " he said .
" studies show that some gold in the portfolio does improve risk adjusted returns but the current holdings of the bundesbank are excessive for this purpose . " just how many assets should the government sell ? officially , bundesbank chief weber has argued that the bank 's independence can not and should not be violated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatians are skeptical about the eu , though they 're likely to be the next to join southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown . in 2004 , the european union absorbed 10 new members , mostly from the former eastern bloc .
now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

but the eu warned germany not to offer it . the european union has threatened germany with legal sanctions over a proposal being considered to protect deutsche telekom from competition if it develops its new high-speed vdsl -lrb- very high data-rate digital subscriber line -rrb- network . " if the text of the draft law remains as it stands , i will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings against germany , " eu information society commissioner viviane reding told reporters after a meeting with german deputy economics minister joachim würmeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it will take legal action if germany presses forward calling the measure to exempt the network from the obligation to grant access to rivals " protectionist , " eu officials said that it also goes against an eu push to open up national telecoms markets . german officials have said they do n't want to violate eu laws .
but the european commission said in a statement that german officials " have made clear that politically , the objective of the german government was to help deutsche telekom .
if germany goes this way , this could set a very negative precedent for other crucial sectors such as energy , where we need open markets and more competition in europe . " germa n s wa n t a deal the dispute began after deutsche telekom last month urged the german government to create legislation to protect its new high-speed telephone network from competitors , at least during the roll-out period . the draft law of the new telecoms act would allow the network regulator to postpone policing the new vdsl services on condition that competition would be safeguarded " in the long term . "
in return , deutsche telekom promised to establish the vdsl in the 50 largest german cities . politicians of all political persuasions , including german chancellor angela merkel , back the plan and have called for it to go forward . telekom threate n i n g n ot to build n etwork the measure was introduced after the telecommunications giant threatened not to build its 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- vdsl network if it were forced to grant rivals access to it straight away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom says it needs the protection in order to justify its investment deutsche telekom chairman kai-uwe ricke told reporters last month that the government 's current proposals for the legislative framework for next-generation telecom infrastructures were " a step in the right direction . " but they nevertheless lacked the clarity and commitment that deutsche telekom needed to roll out its planned vdsl network , he said . " i am not talking about monopolist profits , " ricke said .
" we simply want to be able to determine our own destiny in a new market .
we need clear legal commitments regarding the long-term regulatory situation if we are to roll out this -lrb- vdsl -rrb- project .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant inflatable dinosaur with a car and a factory in its jaws was set up in front of the european council headquarters where the meeting was held on tuesday " at this stage , it 's not a formal negotiation aimed at coming up with any precise result , " his spokesman explained on tuesday .
moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability .

" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .

" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .

but the eu warned germany not to offer it . the european union has threatened germany with legal sanctions over a proposal being considered to protect deutsche telekom from competition if it develops its new high-speed vdsl -lrb- very high data-rate digital subscriber line -rrb- network . " if the text of the draft law remains as it stands , i will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings against germany , " eu information society commissioner viviane reding told reporters after a meeting with german deputy economics minister joachim würmeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it will take legal action if germany presses forward calling the measure to exempt the network from the obligation to grant access to rivals " protectionist , " eu officials said that it also goes against an eu push to open up national telecoms markets . german officials have said they do n't want to violate eu laws .
but the european commission said in a statement that german officials " have made clear that politically , the objective of the german government was to help deutsche telekom .
if germany goes this way , this could set a very negative precedent for other crucial sectors such as energy , where we need open markets and more competition in europe . " germa n s wa n t a deal the dispute began after deutsche telekom last month urged the german government to create legislation to protect its new high-speed telephone network from competitors , at least during the roll-out period . the draft law of the new telecoms act would allow the network regulator to postpone policing the new vdsl services on condition that competition would be safeguarded " in the long term . "
in return , deutsche telekom promised to establish the vdsl in the 50 largest german cities . politicians of all political persuasions , including german chancellor angela merkel , back the plan and have called for it to go forward . telekom threate n i n g n ot to build n etwork the measure was introduced after the telecommunications giant threatened not to build its 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- vdsl network if it were forced to grant rivals access to it straight away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom says it needs the protection in order to justify its investment deutsche telekom chairman kai-uwe ricke told reporters last month that the government 's current proposals for the legislative framework for next-generation telecom infrastructures were " a step in the right direction . " but they nevertheless lacked the clarity and commitment that deutsche telekom needed to roll out its planned vdsl network , he said . " i am not talking about monopolist profits , " ricke said .
" we simply want to be able to determine our own destiny in a new market .

now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .
in serbia , bulgaria and romania , about 70 percent of respondents associated the eu with better times . respondents in all countries also agreed that the downside of eu membership was inflationary prices , though the expectation was that wage levels would rise accordingly .
many however , had doubts that job market prospects would improve . " plenty of folks in some of the countries do n't quite believe that the greater capital investment from abroad -lrb- that comes with eu membership -rrb- will necessarily translate into jobs , " commented gerhard bauer , head of the ögfe institute . austria benefits from eu enlargement in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most balkan nationals prefer keeping their savings at home with its geographical advantage in central europe , austrian companies , and banks in particular , are very well-positioned to benefit from an enlarged eu in the southeast region . one of the questions in the survey had to do with where respondents felt most comfortable about investing their savings - at a local bank , a foreign bank in their home country or under the mattress . in croatia , macedonia and serbia , fully one-quarter of the respondents were prepared to put their savings into a foreign -lrb- austrian -rrb- bank , but only 7 percent of bulgarians and 11 percent of romanians felt comfortable about doing so .
" on the other hand , quite a number of austrian banks have taken over local ones recently , " said bauer . in some of the balkan countries - macedonia , serbia and bosnia - the majority felt most comfortable with keeping cash in the home .
others - bulgarians , romanians and albanians - mostly trusted their home-grown banks . certainly much of the distrust of banks in general stems from the belief that corruption would not necessarily diminish in a better economic climate .
only in albania , one of the poorest candidate countries , did the majority of respondents agree that corruption would decline .
a majority in all the other countries equated corruption with the communist past and said it has even risen and would continue to remain at a high level . diverging views on treatment of war criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic appearing before un war crimes tribunal one final survey question concerned whether war criminals from the former yugoslavia should stand trial before an international tribunal or one in their home country .
here the differences of opinion among the balkan states were clear . serbs and croatians wanted trials to be held in their own countries .
the controversial circumstances surrounding former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic , who died on saturday in custody while being tried by the united nations for war crimes , has serbs divided over the role of international tribunals . on the other hand , a majority of albanians and half of all bosnians , who were largely victims of ethnic cleansing during the war in the balkans , said that war criminals should be tried in international courts of justice . emir numanovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu holds tentative carrot out to balkans the european union will try to reassure balkan leaders saturday that it still wants them in its club , despite clear doubts in some eu capitals alarmed at the prospect of yet another enlargement .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .

the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .

" dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .

" i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .

" dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .

but the eu warned germany not to offer it . the european union has threatened germany with legal sanctions over a proposal being considered to protect deutsche telekom from competition if it develops its new high-speed vdsl -lrb- very high data-rate digital subscriber line -rrb- network . " if the text of the draft law remains as it stands , i will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings against germany , " eu information society commissioner viviane reding told reporters after a meeting with german deputy economics minister joachim würmeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it will take legal action if germany presses forward calling the measure to exempt the network from the obligation to grant access to rivals " protectionist , " eu officials said that it also goes against an eu push to open up national telecoms markets . german officials have said they do n't want to violate eu laws .
but the european commission said in a statement that german officials " have made clear that politically , the objective of the german government was to help deutsche telekom .
if germany goes this way , this could set a very negative precedent for other crucial sectors such as energy , where we need open markets and more competition in europe . " germa n s wa n t a deal the dispute began after deutsche telekom last month urged the german government to create legislation to protect its new high-speed telephone network from competitors , at least during the roll-out period . the draft law of the new telecoms act would allow the network regulator to postpone policing the new vdsl services on condition that competition would be safeguarded " in the long term . "
in return , deutsche telekom promised to establish the vdsl in the 50 largest german cities . politicians of all political persuasions , including german chancellor angela merkel , back the plan and have called for it to go forward . telekom threate n i n g n ot to build n etwork the measure was introduced after the telecommunications giant threatened not to build its 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- vdsl network if it were forced to grant rivals access to it straight away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom says it needs the protection in order to justify its investment deutsche telekom chairman kai-uwe ricke told reporters last month that the government 's current proposals for the legislative framework for next-generation telecom infrastructures were " a step in the right direction . " but they nevertheless lacked the clarity and commitment that deutsche telekom needed to roll out its planned vdsl network , he said . " i am not talking about monopolist profits , " ricke said .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant inflatable dinosaur with a car and a factory in its jaws was set up in front of the european council headquarters where the meeting was held on tuesday " at this stage , it 's not a formal negotiation aimed at coming up with any precise result , " his spokesman explained on tuesday .
moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability . " when you talk about energy security without security of demand you are talking about an abstract problem , " said alexander medvedev .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .
if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force .

-lrb- march 13 , 2006 -rrb- merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't gotten this bad - yet but the idea was rejected out of hand by the states ' chief negotiator , lower saxony state finance minister hartmut möllring of merkel 's christian democrats , who demanded a return to the negotiating table without the intervention of third parties .
governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the spd 's platzeck are n't smiling now verdi opposes state plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without additional pay .
employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.03.2006 germany keeps its midas touch - for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should this be dumped to help the country 's budget difficulties ?
a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet . the world is again being seized by gold fever .
over the course of the past five years , the price of bullion has doubled .
the current value of some $ 550 -lrb- 462 euros -rrb- for one troy ounce is not even close to the all-time highs of the early 1980s .
but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .
the deutsche mark became the favored currency on the continent - until 2002 . diminished responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death knell for the german mark - the euro when the euro was brought into circulation in its metal and paper form on jan .
1 , 2002 , the bundesbank suddenly lost it primary responsibilities - the minting of coinage and bills , circulation and fiscal duties .
overnight , the frankfurt-based institution became a veritable equal among all the other central banks of the euro zone .
the center of monetary power shifted within germany 's financial capital to the european central bank , whose modern headquarters far outshined those of the old german mark managers . but the bundesbank is still responsible for the gold reserves that are currently worth some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- .
bank president axel weber has repeatedly rejected calls from politicians in berlin to be more generous with the gold reserves and has not responded positively to possible legislation that might force his hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber -lrb- l -rrb- also had gold talks with former finance minister hans eichel " we are not pursuing a change of the current law , " he said in an interview with dow jones news published on the bundesbank web site .
if the law is amended then it is " mandatory , that our autonomy with regard to politically-related currency decisions and the management of the -lrb- gold -rrb- reserves not be touched . " special status gone with grand coalition members of germany 's ruling parties have accused the bundesbank of acting improperly .
in the financial times deutschland , social democratic parliamentarian joachim poss last month called the bank board members " vain " and " stubborn . " christian democratic parliamentarian and budget committee member steffen kampeter was more diplomatic in his assessment of the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardians of the euro - the ecb headquarters in frankfurt " we have to ask ourselves , and the bank must ask itself , just how many gold reserves are necessary for a central bank that no longer manages a single currency , " kampeter said .
" it would be smart to think of other reserve alternatives , such as other currencies . " gold analyst philip klapwijk from gfms in london agreed with those sentiments . " given that over 50 percent of the bundesbank 's foreign reserves are in gold -lrb- valued at market prices -rrb- , there is a case for reserve diversification , " he said .
" studies show that some gold in the portfolio does improve risk adjusted returns but the current holdings of the bundesbank are excessive for this purpose . " just how many assets should the government sell ? officially , bundesbank chief weber has argued that the bank 's independence can not and should not be violated .
its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

yet one man ’ s trash is another man ’ s treasure .
american equity funds have been snapping up the portfolios being discarded in germany .

a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet . the world is again being seized by gold fever .
over the course of the past five years , the price of bullion has doubled .
the current value of some $ 550 -lrb- 462 euros -rrb- for one troy ounce is not even close to the all-time highs of the early 1980s .
but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .
the deutsche mark became the favored currency on the continent - until 2002 . diminished responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death knell for the german mark - the euro when the euro was brought into circulation in its metal and paper form on jan .
1 , 2002 , the bundesbank suddenly lost it primary responsibilities - the minting of coinage and bills , circulation and fiscal duties .
overnight , the frankfurt-based institution became a veritable equal among all the other central banks of the euro zone .
the center of monetary power shifted within germany 's financial capital to the european central bank , whose modern headquarters far outshined those of the old german mark managers . but the bundesbank is still responsible for the gold reserves that are currently worth some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- .
bank president axel weber has repeatedly rejected calls from politicians in berlin to be more generous with the gold reserves and has not responded positively to possible legislation that might force his hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber -lrb- l -rrb- also had gold talks with former finance minister hans eichel " we are not pursuing a change of the current law , " he said in an interview with dow jones news published on the bundesbank web site .
if the law is amended then it is " mandatory , that our autonomy with regard to politically-related currency decisions and the management of the -lrb- gold -rrb- reserves not be touched . " special status gone with grand coalition members of germany 's ruling parties have accused the bundesbank of acting improperly .
in the financial times deutschland , social democratic parliamentarian joachim poss last month called the bank board members " vain " and " stubborn . " christian democratic parliamentarian and budget committee member steffen kampeter was more diplomatic in his assessment of the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardians of the euro - the ecb headquarters in frankfurt " we have to ask ourselves , and the bank must ask itself , just how many gold reserves are necessary for a central bank that no longer manages a single currency , " kampeter said .
" it would be smart to think of other reserve alternatives , such as other currencies . " gold analyst philip klapwijk from gfms in london agreed with those sentiments . " given that over 50 percent of the bundesbank 's foreign reserves are in gold -lrb- valued at market prices -rrb- , there is a case for reserve diversification , " he said .
" studies show that some gold in the portfolio does improve risk adjusted returns but the current holdings of the bundesbank are excessive for this purpose . " just how many assets should the government sell ? officially , bundesbank chief weber has argued that the bank 's independence can not and should not be violated .
its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't gotten this bad - yet but the idea was rejected out of hand by the states ' chief negotiator , lower saxony state finance minister hartmut möllring of merkel 's christian democrats , who demanded a return to the negotiating table without the intervention of third parties .
governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the spd 's platzeck are n't smiling now verdi opposes state plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without additional pay .
employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .
but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky .
-lrb- march 4 , 2006 -rrb- service sector strikes spread through german states germany 's biggest public sector strikes since the early 1990s spread when workers at the university hospital in frankfurt stopped work , making the state of hesse the 12th to join in with industrial action .
-lrb- march 10 , 2006 -rrb- public sector strikes widen across germany the biggest public sector strike to hit germany in 14 years escalated after talks broke down between unions and local authorities in a southwestern state and services union verdi warned of a long-drawn out conflict .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't gotten this bad - yet but the idea was rejected out of hand by the states ' chief negotiator , lower saxony state finance minister hartmut möllring of merkel 's christian democrats , who demanded a return to the negotiating table without the intervention of third parties .
governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the spd 's platzeck are n't smiling now verdi opposes state plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without additional pay .
employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .

" europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .

röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "

urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .

" we are making good on our promise to provide a service-oriented and non-bureaucratic solution , " horst r. schmidt , the ok vice president , said in a statement in reference to complaints regarding the red-tape surrounding ticket allocation , returns and swaps .
" however , we expect that 99 percent of all ticket holders will make use of their tickets and go to the stadium themselves , and the ticket portal will only be in place for exceptional cases . " considering how hard it has been to get hold of the tickets , he could be right .

any person transferring a ticket will be liable to a 10 euro fee . " this ticket portal is a platform intended to fight back against the black market and , at the same time , it takes into account the high security requirements of the fifa world cup , " schmidt said , adding that the conditions left no acceptable or justifiable reason to sell or purchase tickets via other channels . the portal will be opened in two time windows .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .

but the eu warned germany not to offer it . the european union has threatened germany with legal sanctions over a proposal being considered to protect deutsche telekom from competition if it develops its new high-speed vdsl -lrb- very high data-rate digital subscriber line -rrb- network . " if the text of the draft law remains as it stands , i will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings against germany , " eu information society commissioner viviane reding told reporters after a meeting with german deputy economics minister joachim würmeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it will take legal action if germany presses forward calling the measure to exempt the network from the obligation to grant access to rivals " protectionist , " eu officials said that it also goes against an eu push to open up national telecoms markets . german officials have said they do n't want to violate eu laws .
but the european commission said in a statement that german officials " have made clear that politically , the objective of the german government was to help deutsche telekom .
if germany goes this way , this could set a very negative precedent for other crucial sectors such as energy , where we need open markets and more competition in europe . " germa n s wa n t a deal the dispute began after deutsche telekom last month urged the german government to create legislation to protect its new high-speed telephone network from competitors , at least during the roll-out period . the draft law of the new telecoms act would allow the network regulator to postpone policing the new vdsl services on condition that competition would be safeguarded " in the long term . "
in return , deutsche telekom promised to establish the vdsl in the 50 largest german cities . politicians of all political persuasions , including german chancellor angela merkel , back the plan and have called for it to go forward . telekom threate n i n g n ot to build n etwork the measure was introduced after the telecommunications giant threatened not to build its 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- vdsl network if it were forced to grant rivals access to it straight away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom says it needs the protection in order to justify its investment deutsche telekom chairman kai-uwe ricke told reporters last month that the government 's current proposals for the legislative framework for next-generation telecom infrastructures were " a step in the right direction . " but they nevertheless lacked the clarity and commitment that deutsche telekom needed to roll out its planned vdsl network , he said . " i am not talking about monopolist profits , " ricke said .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "

" i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .
the state prosecutor in munich is also investigating the case after al-masri brought charges against the german authorities . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german seized by cia says he feared for his life as khaled el masri 's lawyers continue to probe his claims of wrongful abduction and detention at the hands of the cia , the lebanese-born german spoke out about his ordeal .

a widening budget deficit continues to haunt berlin .
spending cuts and tax increases are supposed to shrink the horrific shortfalls .
some would like to sell the country ’ s treasured gold reserves to help make ends meet . the world is again being seized by gold fever .
over the course of the past five years , the price of bullion has doubled .
the current value of some $ 550 -lrb- 462 euros -rrb- for one troy ounce is not even close to the all-time highs of the early 1980s .
but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .
the deutsche mark became the favored currency on the continent - until 2002 . diminished responsibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the death knell for the german mark - the euro when the euro was brought into circulation in its metal and paper form on jan .
1 , 2002 , the bundesbank suddenly lost it primary responsibilities - the minting of coinage and bills , circulation and fiscal duties .
overnight , the frankfurt-based institution became a veritable equal among all the other central banks of the euro zone .
the center of monetary power shifted within germany 's financial capital to the european central bank , whose modern headquarters far outshined those of the old german mark managers . but the bundesbank is still responsible for the gold reserves that are currently worth some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- .
bank president axel weber has repeatedly rejected calls from politicians in berlin to be more generous with the gold reserves and has not responded positively to possible legislation that might force his hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesbank president weber -lrb- l -rrb- also had gold talks with former finance minister hans eichel " we are not pursuing a change of the current law , " he said in an interview with dow jones news published on the bundesbank web site .
if the law is amended then it is " mandatory , that our autonomy with regard to politically-related currency decisions and the management of the -lrb- gold -rrb- reserves not be touched . " special status gone with grand coalition members of germany 's ruling parties have accused the bundesbank of acting improperly .
in the financial times deutschland , social democratic parliamentarian joachim poss last month called the bank board members " vain " and " stubborn . " christian democratic parliamentarian and budget committee member steffen kampeter was more diplomatic in his assessment of the bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardians of the euro - the ecb headquarters in frankfurt " we have to ask ourselves , and the bank must ask itself , just how many gold reserves are necessary for a central bank that no longer manages a single currency , " kampeter said .
" it would be smart to think of other reserve alternatives , such as other currencies . " gold analyst philip klapwijk from gfms in london agreed with those sentiments . " given that over 50 percent of the bundesbank 's foreign reserves are in gold -lrb- valued at market prices -rrb- , there is a case for reserve diversification , " he said .
" studies show that some gold in the portfolio does improve risk adjusted returns but the current holdings of the bundesbank are excessive for this purpose . " just how many assets should the government sell ? officially , bundesbank chief weber has argued that the bank 's independence can not and should not be violated .
its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

but the eu warned germany not to offer it . the european union has threatened germany with legal sanctions over a proposal being considered to protect deutsche telekom from competition if it develops its new high-speed vdsl -lrb- very high data-rate digital subscriber line -rrb- network . " if the text of the draft law remains as it stands , i will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings against germany , " eu information society commissioner viviane reding told reporters after a meeting with german deputy economics minister joachim würmeling . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it will take legal action if germany presses forward calling the measure to exempt the network from the obligation to grant access to rivals " protectionist , " eu officials said that it also goes against an eu push to open up national telecoms markets . german officials have said they do n't want to violate eu laws .
but the european commission said in a statement that german officials " have made clear that politically , the objective of the german government was to help deutsche telekom .
if germany goes this way , this could set a very negative precedent for other crucial sectors such as energy , where we need open markets and more competition in europe . " germa n s wa n t a deal the dispute began after deutsche telekom last month urged the german government to create legislation to protect its new high-speed telephone network from competitors , at least during the roll-out period . the draft law of the new telecoms act would allow the network regulator to postpone policing the new vdsl services on condition that competition would be safeguarded " in the long term . "
in return , deutsche telekom promised to establish the vdsl in the 50 largest german cities . politicians of all political persuasions , including german chancellor angela merkel , back the plan and have called for it to go forward . telekom threate n i n g n ot to build n etwork the measure was introduced after the telecommunications giant threatened not to build its 3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- vdsl network if it were forced to grant rivals access to it straight away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telekom says it needs the protection in order to justify its investment deutsche telekom chairman kai-uwe ricke told reporters last month that the government 's current proposals for the legislative framework for next-generation telecom infrastructures were " a step in the right direction . " but they nevertheless lacked the clarity and commitment that deutsche telekom needed to roll out its planned vdsl network , he said . " i am not talking about monopolist profits , " ricke said .
" we simply want to be able to determine our own destiny in a new market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .
the state prosecutor in munich is also investigating the case after al-masri brought charges against the german authorities . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german seized by cia says he feared for his life as khaled el masri 's lawyers continue to probe his claims of wrongful abduction and detention at the hands of the cia , the lebanese-born german spoke out about his ordeal .

but the increase , particularly the sharp rise in the past 12 months , has made investors think twice about taking their chips off the table and cashing in . and that includes the german government . with over 3,400 tons of gold , germany possesses the second-largest amount of the precious metal in the world - behind the us , which has more than 8,000 tons .
while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .

" we are making good on our promise to provide a service-oriented and non-bureaucratic solution , " horst r. schmidt , the ok vice president , said in a statement in reference to complaints regarding the red-tape surrounding ticket allocation , returns and swaps .
" however , we expect that 99 percent of all ticket holders will make use of their tickets and go to the stadium themselves , and the ticket portal will only be in place for exceptional cases . " considering how hard it has been to get hold of the tickets , he could be right .

any person transferring a ticket will be liable to a 10 euro fee . " this ticket portal is a platform intended to fight back against the black market and , at the same time , it takes into account the high security requirements of the fifa world cup , " schmidt said , adding that the conditions left no acceptable or justifiable reason to sell or purchase tickets via other channels . the portal will be opened in two time windows .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .

governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "

employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .
the state prosecutor in munich is also investigating the case after al-masri brought charges against the german authorities . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german seized by cia says he feared for his life as khaled el masri 's lawyers continue to probe his claims of wrongful abduction and detention at the hands of the cia , the lebanese-born german spoke out about his ordeal .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .

" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .

" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a giant inflatable dinosaur with a car and a factory in its jaws was set up in front of the european council headquarters where the meeting was held on tuesday " at this stage , it 's not a formal negotiation aimed at coming up with any precise result , " his spokesman explained on tuesday .
moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability . " when you talk about energy security without security of demand you are talking about an abstract problem , " said alexander medvedev .
" it 's a two-way street .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .

" if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .

moscow warns europe the visit coincides with a meeting of group of eight energy ministers in moscow . with barroso 's brief in hand and the conclusions from tuesday 's meeting , eu leaders are expected to take the first real step since the russia-ukraine crisis to strengthen union policy when they meet in brussels late next week . in moscow on monday , the deputy head of russian energy giant gazprom warned the eu to get its own house in order and ensure demand predictability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 merkel and chirac discuss joint policies in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both conservatives , merkel and chirac have got off to a positive start a joint european energy policy and eu efforts to agree on a peacekeeping mission in congo were at the center of talks in berlin between german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac . the ministerial meeting was the first since merkel took office in november as head of germany 's grand coalition government of christian and social democrats .
the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy . " europe and russia are energy interdependent , and the message that i will take to moscow is that on energy , as in many other areas where we have common interests , we must maximize our cooperation , " barroso said last week .

now , poorer countries further south of the continent , including those from the formerly war-torn balkans , have high hopes of joining the club .
the more developed of the lot - bulgaria , romania and croatia - have been given a clear signal from brussels for the next expansion , though lately some eu core members , such as france and germany , are having second thoughts about how rapidly to proceed . what the political elites in the candidate countries and eu politicians want is one thing , but what are the expectations of ordinary citizens from albania , bulgaria , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , romania and serbia ? last autumn ögfe , an austrian institute for european policy , and plg , an austrian social research institute , conducted a broad public opinion survey , polling 1,000 nationals from those countries . varied expectations for different countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopes of joining the eu are highest in albania , one of europe 's poorest countries not surprisingly , citizens of all seven countries expected greater political stability and economic gains from eu entry . the survey found that the poorer the country , the higher the hopes of eu entry .
those whose candidate status remains at the bottom of the heap , such as albania and bosnia , were the most optimistic , with 90 percent and 80 percent of respondents respectively , expecting improvements .
conversely , the better the chances of eu entry , the lower the expectations : only half of respondents in croatia said their lives would become better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.03.2006 german cia detainee testifies before eu committee großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia over his kidnapping and imprisonment khaled al-masri , a german citizen who was kidnapped by the cia , told the special committee of the eu parliament that he identified the german man who allegedly interrogated him during his imprisonment in afghanistan . after two hours of grilling by the special committee of the european parliament on monday , khaled al-masri seemed quite exhausted .
he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .
they also asked him why he had traveled to macedonia when the rendition started .
the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament . " now the authorities in germany and macedonia will have to answer tough questions and would have to prove that they did not cover up the kidnapping . " i think macedonia owes us an explanation , whether and when it informed germany , " özdemir said .
" clearly , this did not happen , and that 's not right . " the german parliament will start its own investigation into the matter shortly . khaled al-masri filed a suit against the cia in virginia .
the state prosecutor in munich is also investigating the case after al-masri brought charges against the german authorities . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german seized by cia says he feared for his life as khaled el masri 's lawyers continue to probe his claims of wrongful abduction and detention at the hands of the cia , the lebanese-born german spoke out about his ordeal .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

" we are making good on our promise to provide a service-oriented and non-bureaucratic solution , " horst r. schmidt , the ok vice president , said in a statement in reference to complaints regarding the red-tape surrounding ticket allocation , returns and swaps .
" however , we expect that 99 percent of all ticket holders will make use of their tickets and go to the stadium themselves , and the ticket portal will only be in place for exceptional cases . " considering how hard it has been to get hold of the tickets , he could be right .
those fans who really ca n't make it to the world cup , however , will have the chance to make sure the tickets are used and know that the effort to obtain them was n't a waste . but in true ok and fifa style , the process is not exactly easy .

any person transferring a ticket will be liable to a 10 euro fee . " this ticket portal is a platform intended to fight back against the black market and , at the same time , it takes into account the high security requirements of the fifa world cup , " schmidt said , adding that the conditions left no acceptable or justifiable reason to sell or purchase tickets via other channels . the portal will be opened in two time windows .

while the country boomed in the decades after world war ii , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , bought up the huge amounts to win confidence from outsiders and to secure a stable international currency , despite the fact that the german mark was not on the gold standard . the move paid off .

its legal status of being free from political influence is clear , he has said .
but reading between the lines suggests another message . " the country can not go around selling all its assets , " said michael schubert , the chief economist of commerzbank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to get out of debt , local governments are selling properties yet the german federal government has been doing just that in the last decade , privatizing the country 's fortunes in a fashion resembling a fire-sale .
since 1995 , 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- worth has been sold . " the sale of assets is the wrong perspective for politicians to have , " said deka bank chief economist ulrich kater .
" gold should not be a reserve for the state .
reserves shore up confidence and the sales distract from the real problem . " that problem , according to almost all economists , bank president weber included , is berlin 's failure to balance the country 's budget .
the profits from the sale of gold would only be a drop in the bucket towards plugging the budget shortfalls - and it can only happen once . plus , it is not the responsibility of the bundesbank to pick and choose when might be a profitable time to sell the gold .
to do that , the bank would have to be privatized itself , an event that is as improbable as an overnight cure to the country 's financial difficulties . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden agrees to sell real estate holdings to us investor in a deal that will wipe out the eastern german city of dresden 's debt in one go , us property investment company fortress deutschland has been given the go-ahead to buy the city 's entire residential real estate holdings .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .

governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price .

employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .
if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force .

as garbage remained uncollected and child care centers shuttered , half of merkel 's power-sharing government urged a new approach in the talks , ahead of three key state elections this month . the leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , matthias platzeck , suggested arbitration to bridge the gap between the two sides .
" arbitration is a sensible suggestion which it is worth discussing , " platzeck said at a meeting of the party leadership in stuttgart , the capital of baden-württemberg which goes to the polls march 26 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't gotten this bad - yet but the idea was rejected out of hand by the states ' chief negotiator , lower saxony state finance minister hartmut möllring of merkel 's christian democrats , who demanded a return to the negotiating table without the intervention of third parties .
governing parties at odds the spd has been highly critical of möllring 's hard-line approach and has accused him of driving the talks into a dead end . " möllring must be replaced - that is the way to end this conflict , " said ute vogt , the spd candidate for state premier in baden-württemberg who is trying to unseat a conservative . the spd premier of rhineland-palatinate , kurt beck , who is also facing an election this month , threatened that spd-led state governments could quit the employers ' association represented by möllring due to his combative style . however , möllring has attempted to tap into citizens ' anger over the walk-outs in protest at a work increase of only 18 minutes per day in jobs that are well protected from the widespread layoffs plaguing the private sector .
" we expect the union to agree to lengthen the work day by 18 minutes but it will only agree to 14 minutes per week - that is pure provocation , " möllring said .
" i am only representing the position agreed upon by the state employers ' association , " he said , adding that the states could not accept a deal " at any price . " merkel 's conservatives have rallied around möllring and accused the spd of undermining a negotiating position in the states ' interest . differences exposed " the conflict could become problematic for the grand coalition because it shows their differing relations with the unions , " the daily süddeutsche zeitung said , referring to the government .
" in the interest of harmony in the coalition , it would not be good if the state employers ' association broke into spd- and conservative-led factions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the spd 's platzeck are n't smiling now verdi opposes state plans to extend the working week from 38.5 hours to 40 hours without additional pay .
employers have offered a compromise of 39.5 hours .
the union argues that longer working hours will lead to tens of thousands of job cuts , while the cash-strapped states say the measure is an essential step toward plugging holes in the public coffers . as the tension mounted in the states , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that neither the federal government nor the chancellor planned to intervene , citing the states ' right to agree public sector work contracts . negotiations are to continue in baden-württemberg tuesday between verdi and state employers . about 4.7 million people are employed in germany 's public sector . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany divided over minimum wage the german government is giving serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .
but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky .

he spoke with a soft voice and gave only a few details of his ordeal .
the bulk of the information came from his lawyer who took over when al-masri mixed up the facts and did not understand the questions . al-masri , who was abducted in macedonia in late 2003 , said that a man called " sam " questioned him three or four times during his imprisonment in afghanistan .
he said he recognized this man on a photograph and during a line-up and identity check in a police station in germany recently . " ' sam ' is german , i am sure , " al-masri said .
" i saw a picture of gerhard lehman , i am absolutely convinced that he was ' sam ' . " a man called gerhard lehman does indeed exist .
he works for the german federal criminal police , but the german police authorities said that lehman had nothing to do with al-masri 's kidnapping . truth or dare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wrongful abudction of el masri by the cia is not being contested the parliamentarians wanted to know why al-masri was so sure that he was actually held in afghanistan by the cia .

the answers al-masri gave were not very convincing for everybody . " i 've never been to a hearing in which the words ' i do n't know , ' ' i assume , ' and ' maybe ' were used so frequently , " said elmar brok , a german eu parliamentarian and member of the european people 's party .
" no clear evidence was produced . " brok added he is convinced that the german authorities are telling the truth . " obviously , the americans conducted the abduction , " he said .
" nobody is contesting that , but there is no evidence that the authorities of a member state of the european parliament participated or covered it up . " lack of empathy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir : eu parliamentarians should show more empathy germany 's eu parliamentarian cem özdemir of the green party said he had no doubt that al-masri was abducted and illegally held . " we do n't have to believe literally everything he says , " özdemir said .
" but a parliamentarian should empathize with the fact that he was kidnapped and taken to afghanistan , that he was obviously robbed of his freedom .
some christian democrat colleagues from germany behaved here in a way which was unworthy of a parliament .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "
bettina röhl asks herself , referring to the article entitled " hitler in you , " which meinhof published in 1961 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german terrorist 's brain will join her body the brain of ulrike meinhof , which has sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years following scientific research , will be buried along with her body in a berlin cemetery .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .
and conservative german economics minister michael glos added that forced mergers did not belong in a market economy .
french leaders hit back , saying that their country was not protectionist at all , as it ranked among those countries which attract the larger shares of foreign investment .
french prime minister dominique de villepin was unable to take part in the berlin gathering , as his presence was required in france because of ongoing student protests over a controversial new labor law . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks set to lead likely eu mission in congo the eu still has a few weeks to decide on whether it will send a small military force to police elections in the democratic republic of congo .
if it does , germany is the member country most likely to lead the force .

the gathering was intended to prepare a joint franco-german strategy for next week 's eu summit in brussels on the modernization of europe 's economy . german and french leaders on tuesday reiterated their resolve to maintain and deepen their excellent bilateral ties which had been given a significant boost by chancellor angela merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder . along with britain , the two countries have been at the forefront of efforts to settle the dispute over iran 's nuclear ambitions through diplomatic means .
france and germany have also been pushing eu member countries to agree on a military mission in support of un peacekeepers in the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
merkel said on tuesday the two nations were prepared to be part of such a mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both cabinets met up in berlin " i only want to say that france and germany are agreed on the conditions for such a mission , including a un mandate and the willingness of the congolese government to accept a contingent from the eu , " she said .
" it 's also important to clearly define the length of the troops ' stay in the drc .
we believe that if such a mission comes about , it would have the active support of a great number of eu member countries . "
more bilateral cooperation france and germany also agreed to cooperate more closely in shaping a joint energy safety policy , the aim of which is to decrease dependence on single energy suppliers and markets . " i 'd like to thank the chancellor for her warm welcome and the efforts of her delegation to arrive at a joint energy policy within the european union , " said chirac .
" we 'll have to debate the issue further with a view to ensuring that such a policy is in line with safety requirements and environmental considerations . " both countries are also willing to better share information on motorists who break traffic regulations by linking electronic databases .
the leaders also addressed a number of issues related to the integration of young migrants in western societies .
france was rocked by urban riots last november , while in germany , a decades-old policy of multiculturalism has shown serious flaws . " we 've heard several reports about the importance of integrating young foreigners into our societies , " merkel said .
" we all know about our current problems on this front , and we 've decided that we 'll have a large meeting in october with french and german migrants to look at the root causes of discontent and anger . " dispute over protectionism the franco-german ministerial meeting was overshadowed by disagreement over france 's industrial policies which some german policymakers called protectionist .
the dispute centers on a move by paris to rubberstamp the merger of french utility giant suez and state-owned gaz de france in an attempt to fend off a potential takeover bid from the italian enel group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student protests kept villepin from coming to berlin merkel 's chief aide , thomas de maiziere , had described the move as contrary to european legislation .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy .

" we need a new energy partnership with russia , " said austrian economy minister martin bartenstein , who chaired the meeting as current eu president .
" ideally we would want to avoid the sort of things that happened at the beginning of this year or at least be able to defuse and resolve them quickly , " he told reporters . russia meets around 20 percent of the natural gas needs of europe - the world 's second largest energy market - and fears have grown about a dependency on those supplies since the gas conflict during a particularly tough winter .
the crisis reduced the volume of gas piped to western europe across the former soviet state , exposed weaknesses in the union 's energy policy and highlighted the powerful influence resources can have on foreign policy . " in terms of external relations , with big partners such as russia , it is important that we see the development of a european strategy , " said british energy minister malcolm wicks . the eu and russia began an " energy dialogue " in 2000 on a number of issues , including energy supply , power grids and research , but an eu official said the idea now was for the dialogue to transform into concrete measures .
" europe and russia are energy interdependent " during their talks , the ministers refined the principles on which they want to build the new energy ties with russia but gave no concrete details about how things could change .
in a new energy policy document , they pledged to try to convince russia to ratify the energy treaty and reinforce their contacts with other energy suppliers , as well as consumers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu chief barroso meets russian president putin on friday moscow has signed the treaty , which essentially sets the rules for energy international cooperation , but has so far declined to ratify it , although it does apply the document provisionally . " if russia were to sign up to that , it would be an important signal that they will do everything they can to promote a sustainable and transparent supply of energy , " said bartenstein . european commission president jose manuel barroso meets russian president vladimir putin on friday . the ministers also discussed the eu executive 's new green paper , which urges them to speak with one voice on energy .

in 1968 , at the age of six , she witnessed the divorce of her parents - ulrike marie meinhof and klaus reiner röhl , editors of the west german leftist magazine ko n kret . only two years later , her mother helped andreas baader , a revolutionary , petty criminal and high school dropout , escape from prison .
the two became infamous leaders of a revolutionary terrorist group known as the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , responsible for a series of robberies , kidnappings and bombings all over germany .
at least 30 people including prominent industrialists and businessmen were killed in raf attacks . when bettina was only 10 years old , ulrike meinhof was captured and preliminarily sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
four years later , she committed suicide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police handouts on ulrike meinhof from 1972 today , bettina röhl is a journalist living in hamburg .
she caused quite a stir in 2001 when she revealed that german foreign minister joschka fischer used to be a militant " street fighter . "
in 2002 , she fought , successfully , to have her mother 's brain - which sat in a container with formaldehyde for 26 years - reunited with her body and laid to rest in a berlin cemetery . and she is still trying - both personally and politically - to come to terms with her family 's history .
röhl 's ambitious book entitled " making communism fun !
urlike meinhof , klaus rainer röhl and the konkret files " will hit the bookstands in germany this week . it is a complex and unflinching analysis of the work her parents did in the years leading up to meinhof 's radicalization as a terrorist .
it reveals , among other things , the extent to which the underground communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- - which was outlawed by the federal constitutional court of germany in 1956 - influenced the west german student movement in the sixties .
it also tells a fascinating cold war story about ko n kret as a mouthpiece of the east german communists in the west . diggi n g up the archives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kpd was banned in west germany in 1956 in the berlin federal archive , which now also contains the holdings of the former central state archive of the german democratic republic , bettina röhl discovered comprehensive evidence that her parents ' avant-garde magazine was , at least until 1964 , controlled and financed from an east berlin cell of kpd . the " contents and character of the magazine " were so important to the comrades from the east that ko n kret caught the attention of and received direct approval from erich honecker , head of the central council of the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- at the time and future secretary general of the east german communists . to prevent an obvious identification with the gdr , every effort was made to publish at least one anti-communist article in every issue of the magazine .
at the same time , röhl was receiving 40,000 deutsche marks -lrb- about 20,000 euros or $ 23,810 -rrb- in cash from east berlin for every issue he published . while she described her mother as a communist " out of passion , " bettina röhl said that over time her father turned into a " useful idiot " following direct orders from east berlin a commu n ist breakup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl is not afraid to ask tough questions about her parents the röhls ' cooperation with east berlin , however , came to an abrupt end in 1964 .
the newly appointed stalinist apparatchiks from the other side of the berlin wall were no longer enamored of the magazine published in the capitalist west and especially not of the editorial liberties which the röhls occasionally took - not hiding , for instance , their pro-chinese views . after meinhof went underground in 1970 , klaus reiner röhl continued publishing ko n kret for another three years .
meinhof was offered " a new identity " in east germany , but she turned the offer down .
instead , she opted for the " urban guerilla " warfare of the red army faction . in her book , bettina röhl is trying to come to grips with the reasons why her mother made the fateful move from being a critical journalist to becoming an active terrorist . " who is this east-obsessed 26-year-old brat , who can rule out her own liability and divide the germans into the good and the bad ? "

one woman in four is abused in her lifetime .
men and those in same-sex relationships are also victims of violence in the home .
so it is not surprising companies are starting to address the problem - after all , it makes good financial sense .
domestic violence is estimated to cost the uk economy £ 2.7bn a year in decreased productivity , lost wages and sick pay .
stigma absenteeism , errors and increased employee turnover also takes their toll - as does the effect on co-workers , who could feel frustrated by an inability to help or even be put in danger .
add to this human misery the cost to uk services : the estimated £ 3.1bn a year burden placed on the justice , healthcare and social service systems .
all too often , the perceived stigma of domestic violence keeps victims and those around them silent .
' i walked away ' hence a government-led initiative called the corporate alliance , which sees companies working with charities to help sufferers among their workforce .
" women are in the workplace - naturally a number of them will be affected , " says chris davis , the head of global campaigns at body shop international .
" work is a place where they feel comfortable to seek help and ask advice . "
he turns around the accusation that it could be seen as interfering in people 's lives , saying : " we are being a responsible company .

because it 's a private matter , it does n't mean a company should not offer support .
" companies need to have a policy in place , they need to promote it , but do it sensitively . "
as well as supporting the alliance , the charity women 's aid has launched an initiative with the cbi to address the problem .
" for the employer , they are losing a lot of money , " says ellie smithson , from women 's aid .
" the business case for dealing with domestic violence is strong .

" people are happy to discuss the fact someone could get hurt on the street by a stranger than behind closed doors " ellie smithson , women 's aid she cites the example of one employer who said that the first instinct of a manager who sees a worker looking ill , tired or upset is to send them home .
home , however , could be the worst place to send them .
" we are trying to bring domestic violence out from behind closed doors and change attitudes that it is a private problem .
poster campaign but what can companies reasonably do ?
kpmg signed up to the corporate alliance .
its policy is to publicise the problem and foster an atmosphere where victims can come forward .
posters were placed on the back of toilet doors , for instance , and the kpmg policy was publicised on the company 's intranet .
rachel campbell , head of people management at kpmg , believes responsibility extends further than just human resources .
" line managers must develop confidence in dealing with domestic violence , " she says .
" they must be clear about where the firm stands on this issue , what support is available and which procedures apply .
" kpmg has developed policies and training to give line managers the confidence to deal with victims and abusers . "
" domestic violence does n't discriminate between age , gender , race or class .
we need to deal with it as an employer " uzma hamid , kpmg uzma hamid , the corporate social responsibility team manager , points out that the company has to handle the problem sensitively .
" we raise the issue so it 's ok for people to discuss it .
we were aware when we launched that we did n't want victims to get the wrong idea - and that we 'd come up and tap them on the shoulder .
if they wanted to come forward , there were resources . "
and later this year , kpmg is developing further training for managers .
" we 're linking it with performance management , so managers can be aware if they are having problems with people 's performance , it -lsb- domestic violence -rsb- manifests itself through productivity .
" domestic violence does n't discriminate between age , gender , race or class .
we need to deal with it as an employer , " she says .
in other words - big , blue chip companies suffer too .
" i was very surprised that no-one came back and said ' this is not the kind of thing that happens here ' , " she says .
as ellie smithson says : " the more people talk about domestic violence , women realise they are not on their own .
it 's not their fault .
they do n't have to stay in an abusive relationship .
" the more it 's discussed , the more society condemns , the more women are seen as equals , the less it will happen . "

one woman in four is abused in her lifetime .
men and those in same-sex relationships are also victims of violence in the home .
so it is not surprising companies are starting to address the problem - after all , it makes good financial sense .
domestic violence is estimated to cost the uk economy £ 2.7bn a year in decreased productivity , lost wages and sick pay .
stigma absenteeism , errors and increased employee turnover also takes their toll - as does the effect on co-workers , who could feel frustrated by an inability to help or even be put in danger .
add to this human misery the cost to uk services : the estimated £ 3.1bn a year burden placed on the justice , healthcare and social service systems .
all too often , the perceived stigma of domestic violence keeps victims and those around them silent .
' i walked away ' hence a government-led initiative called the corporate alliance , which sees companies working with charities to help sufferers among their workforce .
" women are in the workplace - naturally a number of them will be affected , " says chris davis , the head of global campaigns at body shop international .
" work is a place where they feel comfortable to seek help and ask advice . "
he turns around the accusation that it could be seen as interfering in people 's lives , saying : " we are being a responsible company .
annual cost of domestic violence criminal justice system : £ 1bn nhs for physical injuries : £ 1.2bn mental care : £ 176m social services -lrb- mainly for children -rrb- : £ 250m emergency housing : £ 160m civil legal services : £ 300m lost economic output : £ 2.7bn source : women & equality unit september 2004 " we want to do two things : we want to look after our staff - and we want our staff to enjoy their work and to work productively .
because it 's a private matter , it does n't mean a company should not offer support .
" companies need to have a policy in place , they need to promote it , but do it sensitively . "
as well as supporting the alliance , the charity women 's aid has launched an initiative with the cbi to address the problem .
" for the employer , they are losing a lot of money , " says ellie smithson , from women 's aid .
" the business case for dealing with domestic violence is strong .
" there 's the element of being a responsible employer and looking after their employees .
the workplace can be the safest place for women . "
people are happy to discuss the fact someone could get hurt on the street by a stranger than behind closed doors ellie smithson , women 's aid she cites the example of one employer who said that the first instinct of a manager who sees a worker looking ill , tired or upset is to send them home .
home , however , could be the worst place to send them .
" we are trying to bring domestic violence out from behind closed doors and change attitudes that it is a private problem .
poster campaign but what can companies reasonably do ?
kpmg signed up to the corporate alliance .
its policy is to publicise the problem and foster an atmosphere where victims can come forward .
posters were placed on the back of toilet doors , for instance , and the kpmg policy was publicised on the company 's intranet .
rachel campbell , head of people management at kpmg , believes responsibility extends further than just human resources .
" line managers must develop confidence in dealing with domestic violence , " she says .
" they must be clear about where the firm stands on this issue , what support is available and which procedures apply .
" kpmg has developed policies and training to give line managers the confidence to deal with victims and abusers . "
domestic violence does n't discriminate between age , gender , race or class .
we need to deal with it as an employer uzma hamid , kpmg uzma hamid , the corporate social responsibility team manager , points out that the company has to handle the problem sensitively .
" we raise the issue so it 's ok for people to discuss it .
we were aware when we launched that we did n't want victims to get the wrong idea - and that we 'd come up and tap them on the shoulder .
if they wanted to come forward , there were resources . "
and later this year , kpmg is developing further training for managers .
" we 're linking it with performance management , so managers can be aware if they are having problems with people 's performance , it -lsb- domestic violence -rsb- manifests itself through productivity .
" domestic violence does n't discriminate between age , gender , race or class .
we need to deal with it as an employer , " she says .
in other words - big , blue chip companies suffer too .
" i was very surprised that no-one came back and said ' this is not the kind of thing that happens here ' , " she says .
as ellie smithson says : " the more people talk about domestic violence , women realise they are not on their own .
it 's not their fault .
they do n't have to stay in an abusive relationship .
" the more it 's discussed , the more society condemns , the more women are seen as equals , the less it will happen . "

fiona , who is now 48 , moved away from her family and friends to live in a different city .
but she only found the courage to do so after a manager at work intervened .
i 'm still in the position where i have not seen him since i left , and i do n't want to see him again .
i do n't want him to come along and mess up my life .
he said if he could n't have me , no-one else could , and he threatened to kill me .
i met him at college .
i was very young and very naive .
as time went on the beatings got worse , the violence got worse he said he was madly in love with me after a couple of days - i felt this was wonderful .
but that was the start of the possessiveness .
even in the time we were going out , he was violent to me .
i believed i could change him .
my self-esteem was very low when i met him , and when confronted by this person who was so jealous and possessive , i thought that showed how much he cared .
throughout the marriage , i worked in a bank , he had a number of jobs and progressively had a worsening alcohol problem .
the signs of domestic violence were there but i 'd tried to hide it as time went on , the beatings got worse , the violence got worse .
each time he did it he said : ' i promise it will never happen again . '
i 'm an intelligent woman .
i thought : ' how am i allowing it to happen ? '
i was hiding it , telling lies about having black eyes and bruises .
i was working at two jobs .
he was out drinking and i was trying to get money , i was running up debts .

the one thing that kept me going was my job .

i ended up at the edinburgh royal infirmary severe head injuries ward .
my employer got involved because i had the keys to the bank .
the hospital would n't take responsibility for them , so i had to give them the name of my manager , but i told the hospital i did n't want to see him .
something must have twigged in his head , though , and he was insistent on seeing me .
when he saw me , he could n't believe it .
i said : ' please do n't tell anyone . '
he said : ' do you want your parents to know ? ' and i said , ' please , do n't . '
but he took it out of my hands .
my parents were very straight , the kind who say : ' you 've made your bed , you must lie on it . '
they had no idea .
my mother took me back to the marital home and tried to get me to sit down with him and work it out .
i did n't feel protected .
i had so few friends .
i realised the next time i was beaten , he would have killed me that was when there was involvement from my employer .
he got someone from human resources to come up from london , and come to see me .
i remember the lady , she sat and talked to me and said : ' when the time is right , when you 're ready to go , give me a call and we 'll transfer you anywhere in the country . '

but she only found the courage to do so after a manager at work intervened . "
i 'm still in the position where i have not seen him since i left , and i do n't want to see him again .
i do n't want him to come along and mess up my life .
he said if he could n't have me , no-one else could , and he threatened to kill me .
i met him at college .
i was very young and very naive . "
as time went on the beatings got worse , the violence got worse " he said he was madly in love with me after a couple of days - i felt this was wonderful .
but that was the start of the possessiveness .
even in the time we were going out , he was violent to me .
i believed i could change him .
my self-esteem was very low when i met him , and when confronted by this person who was so jealous and possessive , i thought that showed how much he cared .
throughout the marriage , i worked in a bank , he had a number of jobs and progressively had a worsening alcohol problem . "
the signs of domestic violence were there but i 'd tried to hide it " as time went on , the beatings got worse , the violence got worse .
each time he did it he said : ' i promise it will never happen again . '
i 'm an intelligent woman .
i thought : ' how am i allowing it to happen ? '
i was hiding it , telling lies about having black eyes and bruises .
i was working at two jobs .
he was out drinking and i was trying to get money , i was running up debts .
beatings i was a cashier in a bank and my employer started to notice i was getting into trouble with money .
my manager pulled me in - i was overdrawn and you were n't allowed to do that .
the signs of domestic violence were there , but i 'd tried to hide it .
the one thing that kept me going was my job .
i fed off that .
i looked forward to monday morning and dreaded the weekend .
things were starting to get bad with the beatings .
i ended up at the edinburgh royal infirmary severe head injuries ward .
my employer got involved because i had the keys to the bank .
the hospital would n't take responsibility for them , so i had to give them the name of my manager , but i told the hospital i did n't want to see him .
something must have twigged in his head , though , and he was insistent on seeing me .
when he saw me , he could n't believe it .
i said : ' please do n't tell anyone . '
he said : ' do you want your parents to know ? ' and i said , ' please , do n't . '
but he took it out of my hands .
my parents were very straight , the kind who say : ' you 've made your bed , you must lie on it . '
they had no idea .
my mother took me back to the marital home and tried to get me to sit down with him and work it out .
i did n't feel protected .
i had so few friends . "
i realised the next time i was beaten , he would have killed me " that was when there was involvement from my employer .
he got someone from human resources to come up from london , and come to see me .
i remember the lady , she sat and talked to me and said : ' when the time is right , when you 're ready to go , give me a call and we 'll transfer you anywhere in the country . '
it was that kind of practical help - they did n't want to know the ins and outs , they offered me a practical way out .
my manager offered me the chance to go and see a solicitor .
over the next three months , i realised the next time i was beaten , he would have killed me .
i suddenly realised i could n't change him , it would carry on if i stayed and there was an opportunity to get away from it .
so i rang the lady from hr and said : ' i 'm ready now .
my time has come . '
she said : ' it will take time to find a placement but wait and we 'll do it . '
three months after that , i was told on the wednesday i had a new job to go to on the monday .
i had borrowed money and paid off the debts .
i left everything . "
there are lots of ways employers can help - if they have a policy and procedure " i got on a plane and flew to london , arrived with nowhere to stay .
i found a hostel , got myself in there and got myself to work on the monday .
i walked away and started again - it was the only way i would be safe .
i recently managed to contact the guy who was my manager and we spoke last week .
he said he had had no idea what to do .
he had never had the training - he wanted to help , but knew from a professional point of view , he could only do so much .
there are lots of ways employers can help - if they have a policy and procedure .
i was really lucky because the bank had places for me to go .
it was 20 years ago - it 's taken me this long to tell my story .
it 's an embarrassment for women , because they will be seen as weak in the workplace , and showing some form of weakness is a problem .
people do n't want to talk about it - and part of the problem is that people wo n't talk about it , because it 's got such a stigma .
since then , i 've done all sorts of things , including an mba , and worked hard and started my own business a couple of years ago .
the message is , there is a life outside and you can build yourself up . "

richard brunstrom told bbc wales ' week in week out that making certain drugs illegal has meant control and supply has been handed over to criminal gangs .
mr brunstrom called for a radical review of uk drug policy .
but david raynes from the national drug prevention alliance said most people did not want drugs legalised .
' devastatingly damaging ' mr brunstrom told the programme that he had no problem with having to police the current drug laws , but said a war on drugs was unwinnable .
" we have created an environment that can be exploited by organised crime , and -lrb- the criminals -rrb- are doing so , " said mr brunstrom .
cannabis is the illegal drug with most uk users " literally , billions of pounds a year in the uk alone is being gathered by organised crime from drug addicts , every single penny of it illegal .
" we have caused an explosion in organised crime and in gun crime and the consequences of that flow through our entire society - it has been a really devastatingly damaging policy . "
he added that society stigmatising drug addicts as " lower than low " fuelled the uk 's drugs problem still further .
" you are some form of sub-human , you are somebody to be avoided at all costs , to be alienated and excluded and expelled from society , shunned , despised , but that goes with the territory , if you have a criminal-based regime , " he said .
if possession was no longer a criminal offence there would be no restraining influence whatsoever david raynes , national drug prevention alliance " half of all stealing is caused directly to support a drugs habit .
" so there 's an enormous tidal wave of damage caused not just by drugs but specifically by the fact that they are illegal .
it 's nonsense placed upon nonsense . "
he said that a wider debate was needed to find solutions with leadership from senior people in public agencies .
" i think there is an increasing recognition that what we have been doing simply does n't work , " he added .
" and i think -lrb- there is -rrb- an increasing recognition that we have been playing into the hands of the drugs cartels , we have been making their money for them - that we have been foolish to do so . "
' sadness of situation ' mr brunstrom 's call for drug use to be tackled differently was supported by martin blakeborough who runs the kaleidoscope project helping addicts in newport .
he told week in week out : " i think the sadness of the situation at the moment is we are just looking at it as a criminal justice issue and not as a health issue . "
but david raynes from the national drug prevention alliance - an organisation which campaigns for anti-drug policies - said calls to liberalise drugs laws were " utter nonsense " adding that " most of the population do n't want drugs legalised " .
he said : " if possession was no longer a criminal offence ... there would be no restraining influence whatsoever .
this infectious disease for society would spread and spread .
" we can not do away with the criminal justice system playing some part in the overall system of the way we treat drugs because it 's the criminal justice system that first persuades and gets people into treatment .
" there is nothing else that catches them . "

after surveying 2,100 firms , recruitment company manpower found that 19 % expected to increase their staff numbers in the next three months .
three-quarters expected no change and only 6 % expected to cut jobs .
manpower said confidence was highest among employers in the finance and business services sectors .

bosses said they had been overwhelmed with condolence cards and said a memorial tree will also be planted .
paddy , the adult male giraffe , survived for several days after the fire before succumbing to injuries sustained as a result of smoke inhalation .

scientists mimicked the effect of a traumatic brain injury by severing the optical nerve tract in hamsters , causing the animals to lose vision .
after injecting the hamsters with a solution containing nanoparticles , the nerves re-grew and sight returned .
writing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences , the team hopes this technique could be used in future reconstructive brain surgery .
ultimate challenge repairing nerve damage in the central nervous system after injury is seen as the ultimate challenge for neuroscientists , but so far success in this field has been limited .

the researchers injected the blind hamsters at the site of their injury with a solution containing synthetically made peptides - miniscule molecules measuring just five nanometres long .
once inside the hamster 's brain , the peptides spontaneously arranged into a scaffold-like criss-cross of nanofibres , which bridged the gap between the severed nerves .
the scientists discovered that brain tissue in the hamsters knitted together across the molecular scaffold , while also preventing scar tissue from forming .
importantly , the newly formed brain tissue enabled the brain nerves to re-grow , restoring vision in the injured hamsters .
" we made a cut , put the material in , and then we looked at the brain over different time points , " explained dr rutledge ellis-behnke , a neuroscientist at mit and lead author on the paper .
" the first thing we saw was that the brain had started to heal itself in the first 24 hours .
we had never seen that before - so that was very surprising . "
stroke repair the scientists looked at young hamsters with actively growing nerve cells , and also at adults hamsters whose nerves had stopped growing .
dr ellis-behnke said the team was surprised to find that the nerves in the adult hamsters had re-grown after the injection .
" we found that we had got functional return of vision and orientating behaviour , which was very surprising to us because we thought we would have to promote cell growth , through the growth factors . "
the researchers found the peptides were later broken down by the body into a harmless substance and excreted in the animals ' urine three to four week after first injected .
the scientists believe that they have overcome some of the barriers to nerve regeneration , and hope to be able to apply their work to medical applications at a later stage .
" we are looking at this as a step process .
if this can be used while operating on humans to mitigate damage during neurosurgery , that would be the first step , " dr ellis-behnke told the bbc news website .
" eventually what we would look at is trying to reconnect disconnected parts of the brain during stroke and trauma . "
dr ellis-behnke said that stroke and traumatic brain injury could have a major impact on an individual .
" in order to try to restore quality of life to those individuals you can try to reconnect some disconnected parts to try to give some functionality in the brain for communication and other things like that .
and that 's where we think that this might be very useful , " he added .

the build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries - atherosclerosis - can trigger cardiovascular disease .
an international study of 349 patients over two years found high doses of a powerful new statin , rosuvastatin , could break down the deposits .
details were presented to an american college of cardiology meeting . "
the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients " professor peter weissberg cardiovascular disease kills 233,000 people a year in the uk , and an estimated 16.7 million a year world-wide .
the fatty deposits inside arteries can trigger problems by breaking off and blocking blood flow .
dr sarah jarvis , a london gp and member of the royal college of general practitioners , described the results as " dramatically exciting " .
she said : " we have a drug that can not only halt the progression of the disease but , in the vast majority of patients , it actually showed the disease regress . "
professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said the study was " important " .
but he said it was yet to be demonstrated that breaking down the fatty deposits would actually mean fewer heart attacks .
bad cholesterol the study focused on patients with cardiovascular disease at centres in the us , canada , europe and australia .
they were given intensive treatment with rosuvastatin , known commercially as crestor , which , along with other statins , was known to cut cholesterol levels . "
there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose " dr rosemary leonard patients received at least one 40mg pill of the drug a day - most statins are more commonly used in doses of 10mg or 20mg / day .
tests found that the drug cut levels of potentially damaging ldl-cholesterol by about 50 % and boosted levels of the beneficial hdl form by around 15 % .
as harmful cholesterol was reduced , build-ups of fatty deposits in the patients ' arteries also showed signs of a reduction .
after two years of treatment their thickness was reduced by 6.8 % - and even more so in particularly diseased parts of a blood vessel .
the research found almost four out of five patients -lrb- 78 % -rrb- demonstrated some reduction in the level of atherosclerosis .
the reductions were found to be greatest in the arteries with the most severe disease .
professor weissberg said : " previously it was thought that statins saved lives by stabilising plaques - the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries - thereby preventing them from rupturing to cause a heart attack or stroke .
" this study encouragingly seems to demonstrate a small but definite regression of atherosclerotic plaques .
" however , this study was n't designed to test whether this treatment actually saves lives , so whilst the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients , we still need further studies to confirm whether the regression demonstrated translates to fewer heart attacks . "
safety concern rosuvastatin has previously been linked to a small number of cases of a muscle wasting disease .
however , the drug was given a clean bill of health by the us food and drug administration last year .
a british heart foundation spokesman said statins were extremely safe drugs .
however , he said it might not be practical - or economically viable - to put large numbers of patients on a high dose of one of the most potent forms of the drug .
side effects are more likely at higher doses of drug .
rosemary leonard , a london gp and medical broadcaster , said : " these researchers used an incredibly high dose of a statin drug .
" there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose . "
the study , which was funded by astrazeneca , the makers of rosuvastatin , will be published in the journal of the american medical association in april .

the build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries - atherosclerosis - can trigger cardiovascular disease .
an international study of 349 patients over two years found high doses of a powerful new statin , rosuvastatin , could break down the deposits .
details were presented to an american college of cardiology meeting .
the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients professor peter weissberg cardiovascular disease kills 233,000 people a year in the uk , and an estimated 16.7 million a year world-wide .
the fatty deposits inside arteries can trigger problems by breaking off and blocking blood flow .
dr sarah jarvis , a london gp and member of the royal college of general practitioners , described the results as " dramatically exciting " .
she said : " we have a drug that can not only halt the progression of the disease but , in the vast majority of patients , it actually showed the disease regress . "
professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said the study was " important " .
but he said it was yet to be demonstrated that breaking down the fatty deposits would actually mean fewer heart attacks .
bad cholesterol the study focused on patients with cardiovascular disease at centres in the us , canada , europe and australia .
they were given intensive treatment with rosuvastatin , known commercially as crestor , which , along with other statins , was known to cut cholesterol levels .
there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose dr rosemary leonard patients received at least one 40mg pill of the drug a day - most statins are more commonly used in doses of 10mg or 20mg / day .
tests found that the drug cut levels of potentially damaging ldl-cholesterol by about 50 % and boosted levels of the beneficial hdl form by around 15 % .
as harmful cholesterol was reduced , build-ups of fatty deposits in the patients ' arteries also showed signs of a reduction .
after two years of treatment their thickness was reduced by 6.8 % - and even more so in particularly diseased parts of a blood vessel .
the research found almost four out of five patients -lrb- 78 % -rrb- demonstrated some reduction in the level of atherosclerosis .
the reductions were found to be greatest in the arteries with the most severe disease .
professor weissberg said : " previously it was thought that statins saved lives by stabilising plaques - the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries - thereby preventing them from rupturing to cause a heart attack or stroke .
" this study encouragingly seems to demonstrate a small but definite regression of atherosclerotic plaques .
" however , this study was n't designed to test whether this treatment actually saves lives , so whilst the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients , we still need further studies to confirm whether the regression demonstrated translates to fewer heart attacks . "
safety concern rosuvastatin has previously been linked to a small number of cases of a muscle wasting disease .
however , the drug was given a clean bill of health by the us food and drug administration last year .
a british heart foundation spokesman said statins were extremely safe drugs .
however , he said it might not be practical - or economically viable - to put large numbers of patients on a high dose of one of the most potent forms of the drug .
side effects are more likely at higher doses of drug .
rosemary leonard , a london gp and medical broadcaster , said : " these researchers used an incredibly high dose of a statin drug .
" there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose . "
the study , which was funded by astrazeneca , the makers of rosuvastatin , will be published in the journal of the american medical association in april .

the build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries - atherosclerosis - can trigger cardiovascular disease .
an international study of 349 patients over two years found high doses of a powerful new statin , rosuvastatin , could break down the deposits .
details were presented to an american college of cardiology meeting .
the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients professor peter weissberg cardiovascular disease kills 233,000 people a year in the uk , and an estimated 16.7 million a year world-wide .
the fatty deposits inside arteries can trigger problems by breaking off and blocking blood flow .
dr sarah jarvis , a london gp and member of the royal college of general practitioners , described the results as " dramatically exciting " .
she said : " we have a drug that can not only halt the progression of the disease but , in the vast majority of patients , it actually showed the disease regress . "
professor peter weissberg , medical director of the british heart foundation , said the study was " important " .
but he said it was yet to be demonstrated that breaking down the fatty deposits would actually mean fewer heart attacks .
bad cholesterol the study focused on patients with cardiovascular disease at centres in the us , canada , europe and australia .
they were given intensive treatment with rosuvastatin , known commercially as crestor , which , along with other statins , was known to cut cholesterol levels .
there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose dr rosemary leonard patients received at least one 40mg pill of the drug a day - most statins are more commonly used in doses of 10mg or 20mg / day .
tests found that the drug cut levels of potentially damaging ldl-cholesterol by about 50 % and boosted levels of the beneficial hdl form by around 15 % .
as harmful cholesterol was reduced , build-ups of fatty deposits in the patients ' arteries also showed signs of a reduction .
after two years of treatment their thickness was reduced by 6.8 % - and even more so in particularly diseased parts of a blood vessel .
the research found almost four out of five patients -lrb- 78 % -rrb- demonstrated some reduction in the level of atherosclerosis .
the reductions were found to be greatest in the arteries with the most severe disease .
professor weissberg said : " previously it was thought that statins saved lives by stabilising plaques - the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries - thereby preventing them from rupturing to cause a heart attack or stroke .
" this study encouragingly seems to demonstrate a small but definite regression of atherosclerotic plaques .
" however , this study was n't designed to test whether this treatment actually saves lives , so whilst the results sound promising and are likely to translate into a better outcome for heart patients , we still need further studies to confirm whether the regression demonstrated translates to fewer heart attacks . "
safety concern rosuvastatin has previously been linked to a small number of cases of a muscle wasting disease .
however , the drug was given a clean bill of health by the us food and drug administration last year .
a british heart foundation spokesman said statins were extremely safe drugs .
however , he said it might not be practical - or economically viable - to put large numbers of patients on a high dose of one of the most potent forms of the drug .
side effects are more likely at higher doses of drug .
rosemary leonard , a london gp and medical broadcaster , said : " these researchers used an incredibly high dose of a statin drug .
" there have been warnings about using this high a dose , and gps certainly do n't start with this high a dose . "
the study , which was funded by astrazeneca , the makers of rosuvastatin , will be published in the journal of the american medical association in april .
