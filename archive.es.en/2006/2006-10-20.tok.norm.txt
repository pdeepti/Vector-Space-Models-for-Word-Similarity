" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency . " a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .

that 's because its czech rival and near namesake , budweiser budvar , owns the copyright to the full name in germany . bitburger also claimed that budweiser 's use of " bud " violated its german trademark for its slogan " bitte ein bit " or german for " a bit please . " the eu court however said that the trademarks , though slightly similar in appearance , were clearly different . " considered as a whole , the marks at issue are not similar and there is no likelihood of confusion , " the court said in a statement . bitburger could appeal again anheuser-busch welcomed thursday 's court ruling .
bitburger now has to decide whether to appeal again to europe 's highest court , the european court of justice . the present dispute is separate from a long-running courtroom battle between anheuser-busch and budweiser budvar over the use of the budweiser brand name .
both companies claim a historical right to its use . anheuser-busch 's budweiser has to be called " bud " in a number of european countries , while in the us , budweiser budvar 's brew is called czechvar .
britain remains one of the few countries that allows both companies to use the budweiser brand name . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german brewers court women drinkers beer consumption - and sales - in germany have been on the skids for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency . " a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency . " a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .
questions concerning patents also remain unresolved .

officials in washington , however , said a first set of punitive measures was likely to focus on banning the supply of material and funding for iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear programs . other steps could include asset freezes and travel bans on nuclear and weapons scientists . discussions to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its right to uranium enrichment programs " i expect that iran will be coming -lrb- before the council -rrb- fairly soon , " japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , president of the 15-member council for october , told reporters thursday .
" it depends on the progress of consultations among key interested countries .
but nothing has been discussed yet . " france 's un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere said thursday he hoped a draft could be discussed friday by envoys from germany and the council 's five permanent members - the so-called p5 , which is comprised of britain , france , china , russia and the united . another diplomat said he did not anticipate a draft to be submitted to the full council before next week . " we will have a few days between the p5 + 1 meeting and the consultations -lrb- by the full council -rrb- so the russians and chinese have time to digest the draft , " he added . russia and china may counter sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , represented vitaly churkin , and china may reject sanctions last week senior diplomats from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - finalized a preliminary list of possible sanctions and directed their un envoys to begin drawing up a sanctions draft . their decision came after the european union concluded , following several rounds of fruitless talks with iran , that the issue must be handed back to the security council . but while the six powers agreed on the need for sanctions against tehran , russia and china , which both have important economic ties to iran and traditionally reluctant to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool , are likely to oppose biting sanctions . russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin indicated earlier this week that an accord on a draft would take some time . iranian president not yielding the west suspects that tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian atomic program .
but iran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only and argues it has every right to enrich uranium under the non-proliferation treaty . iran ignored an aug .
31 deadline set by the security council to freeze uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce nuclear reactor fuel but also for bomb-making . thursday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated in a speech in islamshahr , southwest of tehran , that his country would not back down . " the enrichment of uranium and having nuclear fuel are among the main demands of iranian nation , " he said . iran warned of radicalization wednesday , iran also warned the security council against imposing sanctions saying such a move would " radicalize " the situation and affect its cooperation with the un atomic agency . iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said us-led efforts to put a draft resolution to the security council would make ending the standoff even harder and even have consequences for the wider middle east region . last june the p5 and germany drew up a list of 15 possible punitive measures against iran as part of a " carrots and sticks " package that also included economic and security incentives if tehran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

officials in washington , however , said a first set of punitive measures was likely to focus on banning the supply of material and funding for iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear programs . other steps could include asset freezes and travel bans on nuclear and weapons scientists . discussions to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its right to uranium enrichment programs " i expect that iran will be coming -lrb- before the council -rrb- fairly soon , " japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , president of the 15-member council for october , told reporters thursday .
" it depends on the progress of consultations among key interested countries .
but nothing has been discussed yet . " france 's un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere said thursday he hoped a draft could be discussed friday by envoys from germany and the council 's five permanent members - the so-called p5 , which is comprised of britain , france , china , russia and the united . another diplomat said he did not anticipate a draft to be submitted to the full council before next week . " we will have a few days between the p5 + 1 meeting and the consultations -lrb- by the full council -rrb- so the russians and chinese have time to digest the draft , " he added . russia and china may counter sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , represented vitaly churkin , and china may reject sanctions last week senior diplomats from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - finalized a preliminary list of possible sanctions and directed their un envoys to begin drawing up a sanctions draft . their decision came after the european union concluded , following several rounds of fruitless talks with iran , that the issue must be handed back to the security council . but while the six powers agreed on the need for sanctions against tehran , russia and china , which both have important economic ties to iran and traditionally reluctant to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool , are likely to oppose biting sanctions . russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin indicated earlier this week that an accord on a draft would take some time . iranian president not yielding the west suspects that tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian atomic program .
but iran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only and argues it has every right to enrich uranium under the non-proliferation treaty . iran ignored an aug .
31 deadline set by the security council to freeze uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce nuclear reactor fuel but also for bomb-making . thursday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated in a speech in islamshahr , southwest of tehran , that his country would not back down . " the enrichment of uranium and having nuclear fuel are among the main demands of iranian nation , " he said . iran warned of radicalization wednesday , iran also warned the security council against imposing sanctions saying such a move would " radicalize " the situation and affect its cooperation with the un atomic agency . iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said us-led efforts to put a draft resolution to the security council would make ending the standoff even harder and even have consequences for the wider middle east region . last june the p5 and germany drew up a list of 15 possible punitive measures against iran as part of a " carrots and sticks " package that also included economic and security incentives if tehran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .

their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .

the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .

but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .

consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency . " a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .

in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .

rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .

their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .

the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .
if goethe had ever faced-off with eminem in an " 8-mile " -style slam , then goethe would probably have won . zeitgeist doppel u is actually christian weirich , a 23-year-old german hip hop artist who 's worked with rap luminaries from the wu tang clan 's rza to german rapper spax .
he first realized goethe and schiller deserved some respect when he was approached about adapting the classics to mark schiller year in 2004 . initially skeptical , he was soon convinced that the german poet knew at least as much about poverty and prejudice as 50 cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller had pop star qualities " schiller was a killer , " he 's been known to say . since then , he 's released a cd of schiller 's verse set to rap rhythms , called " zeitgeist , " and initiated an educational project aimed at getting school kids into the classics with the help of hip hop . he 's now the official face of the project " young writers and thinkers " and regularly gives workshops in schools .
he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .
when doppel u wants to help bored teenagers get a handle on goethe 's " found , " he tells them it 's all about impressing girls . " in the shade i saw / a little flower standing / like stars glittering / like beautiful little eyes . / i wanted to pick it / when it said delicately : should i just to wilt be picked ? " goes the poem . " goethe wrote it for a woman who did n't want to have a one-night stand with him , " doppel u said .
" so he wrote this in order to persuade her . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go .
-lrb- 29.06.2005 -rrb- german rap keeps it real german hip hop is more diverse than its squeaky clean reputation suggests .
the german counterparts to the likes of dr. dre and busta rhymes used to be middle-class white boys in baseball caps .
but not any more .
-lrb- 26.02.2006 -rrb- a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency .

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .
democracy in danger ?
finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .
democracy in danger ?
finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "

the german unit of benq corp , insolvent mobile phone maker benq mobile , is laying off 1,900 employees of its 3,000-strong workforce , the company confirmed this week . the drastic cuts were necessary in order to keep the business running beyond the start of next year , benq administrator martin prager told a news conference in munich . the cuts would affect all areas of benq mobile , from administration , marketing , sales and production , with more than 1,100 jobs to be axed at the site in kamp lintfort and around 850 to be cut in munich . the remaining company would develop and manufacture mobile phone handsets under license for other makers . the shake-up would help safeguard the remaining 1,150 jobs at the insolvent handset maker , prager said . " only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .
since siemens also effectively paid benq last year to take its loss-making mobile phone operations off its hands , many observers laying the blame at siemens ' door . ig metall , germany 's large metal workers ' union , said on thursday that siemens had to take greater responsibility for the massive loss of jobs resulting from benq 's insolvency . " a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .

the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .
democracy in danger ?
finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

officials in washington , however , said a first set of punitive measures was likely to focus on banning the supply of material and funding for iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear programs . other steps could include asset freezes and travel bans on nuclear and weapons scientists . discussions to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its right to uranium enrichment programs " i expect that iran will be coming -lrb- before the council -rrb- fairly soon , " japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , president of the 15-member council for october , told reporters thursday .

" france 's un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere said thursday he hoped a draft could be discussed friday by envoys from germany and the council 's five permanent members - the so-called p5 , which is comprised of britain , france , china , russia and the united . another diplomat said he did not anticipate a draft to be submitted to the full council before next week . " we will have a few days between the p5 + 1 meeting and the consultations -lrb- by the full council -rrb- so the russians and chinese have time to digest the draft , " he added . russia and china may counter sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , represented vitaly churkin , and china may reject sanctions last week senior diplomats from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - finalized a preliminary list of possible sanctions and directed their un envoys to begin drawing up a sanctions draft . their decision came after the european union concluded , following several rounds of fruitless talks with iran , that the issue must be handed back to the security council . but while the six powers agreed on the need for sanctions against tehran , russia and china , which both have important economic ties to iran and traditionally reluctant to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool , are likely to oppose biting sanctions . russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin indicated earlier this week that an accord on a draft would take some time . iranian president not yielding the west suspects that tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian atomic program .
but iran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only and argues it has every right to enrich uranium under the non-proliferation treaty . iran ignored an aug .

" the enrichment of uranium and having nuclear fuel are among the main demands of iranian nation , " he said . iran warned of radicalization wednesday , iran also warned the security council against imposing sanctions saying such a move would " radicalize " the situation and affect its cooperation with the un atomic agency . iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said us-led efforts to put a draft resolution to the security council would make ending the standoff even harder and even have consequences for the wider middle east region . last june the p5 and germany drew up a list of 15 possible punitive measures against iran as part of a " carrots and sticks " package that also included economic and security incentives if tehran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .

" as the six institutes said in their latest prognosis , the government believes that the current economic upturn will continue at a dynamic pace this year .
and , on this basis , any consolidation measures that might lead to a temporary slowdown next year are easily manageable , " the ministry said . finance minister michael glos found that germany , europe 's economic powerhouse , " is currently in a strong upturn , " adding that the most pleasing about it is that the recovery is making itself felt on the labor market and that it is n't any threat to price stability . " external growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence is growing growth this year would continue to be driven by external , global economic factors . " but domestic impulses are also increasing , " the ministry said .
following the weak consumption of previous years , private consumption is once again contributing to growth , which means the upturn is gaining in depth and breadth and resting increasingly on the two pillars of domestic demand and of exports . in 2005 , the german economy expanded by just 0.9 percent .
but at an anticipated 2.3 percent this year , growth would be at its highest rate since 2000 when gdp grew by 3.1 percent . temporary however , growth was likely to slow next year , as the one-off factors that boosted activity this year would not be repeated , the ministry continued . " despite the increase in sales tax , the slower growth rate is likely to prove only temporary . " many experts believe that the government 's plans to raise value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19 percent will put the brakes on private consumption . the ongoing recovery would have a positive effect on the labor markets , the ministry continued . " the worst is behind us on the labor market , " said minister glos . shrinking unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queues at the job office are set to get shorter the government was forecasting a decline in the annual average number of job-seekers in germany this year to 4.54 million . the trend was expected to continue next year , bringing the jobless total down to 4.34 million . at the same time , the german economy was expected to create around 230,000 new jobs in 2006 and a further 220,000 in 2007 , berlin forecast . the outlook for inflation also remained positive , with consumer prices in germany expected to rise by 1.5 percent in 2006 and 1.8 percent in 2007 , faster than the 1.3 percent recorded in 2005 . that is below the european central bank 's ceiling of 2.0 percent . in that context , any further interest rate hikes by the ecb " are not particularly urgent from a german point of view , " glos said . the ecb has increased borrowing costs five times since december 2005 , each time by a quarter of a percentage point .
the bank 's benchmark " refi " refinancing rate currently stands at 3.25 percent and is expected to rise again to 3.50 percent in december . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economic think tanks upgrade germany 's growth forecasts germany 's six leading economic research institutes on thursday upgraded their forecasts for growth in the euro zone 's biggest economy but cautioned that the recovery was likely to lose momentum next year .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe . " barroso is aiming to garner support at the summit for the eit , which would aim to rival the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- in the united states , although it would only be based on networks of academics and business people . in addition to discussing the eit , leaders will also focus on reviving long-stalled efforts to set up an eu patent system , which have floundered in the past over disputes about which languages to use . eu wants to be international elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has fallen behind other rich countries in technology and education education is seen as key to boosting innovation , especially because the average eu citizen is less educated than adults in other wealthy countries . in 2005 only 23 percent of the eu working population had tertiary education compared to 39 percent in the united states and 37 percent in japan , according to the european commission . while europe has traditionally measured its technological abilities against the united states and japan , it is increasingly looking at developments in china and india . a report by the german think-tank deutschland denken warned in a recent report that europe was in a " race to the top " with china and india to produce " ever higher value-added goods and services " that would determine future prosperity . but europe was ill-prepared because the willingness of policymakers to take up innovation was not matched by the investment in " human capital .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .
if goethe had ever faced-off with eminem in an " 8-mile " -style slam , then goethe would probably have won . zeitgeist doppel u is actually christian weirich , a 23-year-old german hip hop artist who 's worked with rap luminaries from the wu tang clan 's rza to german rapper spax .
he first realized goethe and schiller deserved some respect when he was approached about adapting the classics to mark schiller year in 2004 . initially skeptical , he was soon convinced that the german poet knew at least as much about poverty and prejudice as 50 cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller had pop star qualities " schiller was a killer , " he 's been known to say . since then , he 's released a cd of schiller 's verse set to rap rhythms , called " zeitgeist , " and initiated an educational project aimed at getting school kids into the classics with the help of hip hop . he 's now the official face of the project " young writers and thinkers " and regularly gives workshops in schools .
he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .
when doppel u wants to help bored teenagers get a handle on goethe 's " found , " he tells them it 's all about impressing girls . " in the shade i saw / a little flower standing / like stars glittering / like beautiful little eyes . / i wanted to pick it / when it said delicately : should i just to wilt be picked ? " goes the poem . " goethe wrote it for a woman who did n't want to have a one-night stand with him , " doppel u said .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe .

" might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?

he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .

" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe . " barroso is aiming to garner support at the summit for the eit , which would aim to rival the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- in the united states , although it would only be based on networks of academics and business people . in addition to discussing the eit , leaders will also focus on reviving long-stalled efforts to set up an eu patent system , which have floundered in the past over disputes about which languages to use . eu wants to be international elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has fallen behind other rich countries in technology and education education is seen as key to boosting innovation , especially because the average eu citizen is less educated than adults in other wealthy countries . in 2005 only 23 percent of the eu working population had tertiary education compared to 39 percent in the united states and 37 percent in japan , according to the european commission . while europe has traditionally measured its technological abilities against the united states and japan , it is increasingly looking at developments in china and india . a report by the german think-tank deutschland denken warned in a recent report that europe was in a " race to the top " with china and india to produce " ever higher value-added goods and services " that would determine future prosperity . but europe was ill-prepared because the willingness of policymakers to take up innovation was not matched by the investment in " human capital .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .
if goethe had ever faced-off with eminem in an " 8-mile " -style slam , then goethe would probably have won . zeitgeist doppel u is actually christian weirich , a 23-year-old german hip hop artist who 's worked with rap luminaries from the wu tang clan 's rza to german rapper spax .
he first realized goethe and schiller deserved some respect when he was approached about adapting the classics to mark schiller year in 2004 . initially skeptical , he was soon convinced that the german poet knew at least as much about poverty and prejudice as 50 cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller had pop star qualities " schiller was a killer , " he 's been known to say . since then , he 's released a cd of schiller 's verse set to rap rhythms , called " zeitgeist , " and initiated an educational project aimed at getting school kids into the classics with the help of hip hop . he 's now the official face of the project " young writers and thinkers " and regularly gives workshops in schools .
he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .
when doppel u wants to help bored teenagers get a handle on goethe 's " found , " he tells them it 's all about impressing girls . " in the shade i saw / a little flower standing / like stars glittering / like beautiful little eyes . / i wanted to pick it / when it said delicately : should i just to wilt be picked ? " goes the poem . " goethe wrote it for a woman who did n't want to have a one-night stand with him , " doppel u said .
" so he wrote this in order to persuade her . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.10.2006 experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poor residents of munich wait in line for free food new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .

consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .
if goethe had ever faced-off with eminem in an " 8-mile " -style slam , then goethe would probably have won . zeitgeist doppel u is actually christian weirich , a 23-year-old german hip hop artist who 's worked with rap luminaries from the wu tang clan 's rza to german rapper spax .
he first realized goethe and schiller deserved some respect when he was approached about adapting the classics to mark schiller year in 2004 . initially skeptical , he was soon convinced that the german poet knew at least as much about poverty and prejudice as 50 cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller had pop star qualities " schiller was a killer , " he 's been known to say . since then , he 's released a cd of schiller 's verse set to rap rhythms , called " zeitgeist , " and initiated an educational project aimed at getting school kids into the classics with the help of hip hop . he 's now the official face of the project " young writers and thinkers " and regularly gives workshops in schools .
he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .
when doppel u wants to help bored teenagers get a handle on goethe 's " found , " he tells them it 's all about impressing girls . " in the shade i saw / a little flower standing / like stars glittering / like beautiful little eyes . / i wanted to pick it / when it said delicately : should i just to wilt be picked ? " goes the poem . " goethe wrote it for a woman who did n't want to have a one-night stand with him , " doppel u said .
" so he wrote this in order to persuade her . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 20.10.2006 eu leaders to press putin on energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is the guest of honor in lahti the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .
russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .
" for us , the eu has become a multi-headed monster that many russians do not comprehend - and the number of heads keeps increasing , " he added . on january 1 , rumania und bulgaria , also former members of the soviet bloc , will join the european union as members 26 and 27 . bernd riegert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : european energy usage pushes the limits europeans ' energy usage at peak periods comes alarmingly close to production limits , according to a new study .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .

german rapper doppel u sees goethe and schiller as the slim shadys of their time , and thinks it 's time they were shown some respect . german rapper doppel u is giving new meaning to the term " old-school . " to people in the know , it describes early new york hip hop .
but doppel u knows a good rhyme when he sees one , and he does n't care if it was penned by grandmaster flash or … goethe . " do not tarry / water carry / let it flow abundantly / and prepare a bath for me ! " might not pack the same kind of punch as " do n't push me ' cuz i 'm close to the edge / i 'm trying not to lose my head / uh huh ha ha ha / it 's like a jungle sometimes / it makes me wonder how i keep from goin ' under " - but germany 's 18th century poets actually have quite a lot in common with today 's disaffected urban minorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's first rapper ?
goethe might have written " the sorcerer 's apprentice " some 200 years before grandmaster flash set the us alight with " the message . "
but according to german rapper doppel u , the sturm und drang generation were basically latter-day rappers .
young , rebellious and gifted , their ability to reel off lines that scan perfectly could certainly teach the likes of mos def a thing or two .
if goethe had ever faced-off with eminem in an " 8-mile " -style slam , then goethe would probably have won . zeitgeist doppel u is actually christian weirich , a 23-year-old german hip hop artist who 's worked with rap luminaries from the wu tang clan 's rza to german rapper spax .
he first realized goethe and schiller deserved some respect when he was approached about adapting the classics to mark schiller year in 2004 . initially skeptical , he was soon convinced that the german poet knew at least as much about poverty and prejudice as 50 cent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller had pop star qualities " schiller was a killer , " he 's been known to say . since then , he 's released a cd of schiller 's verse set to rap rhythms , called " zeitgeist , " and initiated an educational project aimed at getting school kids into the classics with the help of hip hop . he 's now the official face of the project " young writers and thinkers " and regularly gives workshops in schools .
he 's even developed a teaching aid in the form of an interactive audio cd . reaching the teenagers it 's certainly one way of making german literature more accessible .
when doppel u wants to help bored teenagers get a handle on goethe 's " found , " he tells them it 's all about impressing girls . " in the shade i saw / a little flower standing / like stars glittering / like beautiful little eyes . / i wanted to pick it / when it said delicately : should i just to wilt be picked ? " goes the poem . " goethe wrote it for a woman who did n't want to have a one-night stand with him , " doppel u said .
" so he wrote this in order to persuade her . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de censoring german rap some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go .
-lrb- 29.06.2005 -rrb- german rap keeps it real german hip hop is more diverse than its squeaky clean reputation suggests .
the german counterparts to the likes of dr. dre and busta rhymes used to be middle-class white boys in baseball caps .
but not any more .

" only chance to save the company " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benq 's future looks bleak " after three weeks of intensive scrutiny , it 's clear that this is the only chance to save the company as a whole , " prager said , adding that the company had made losses worth 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in the past 12 months . he said that he wanted to bring benq " out of the red " by the end of the year in order to find investors to rescue the ailing mobile phone maker . quoting a benq spokesman , bavarian public radio reported thursday that the affected 1,900 employees had been asked not to report to work starting monday and would be given the chance to take part in retraining schemes . benq mobile , formerly the mobile phone business of electronics giant siemens until it was taken over by taiwan-based benq last year , filed for insolvency at the end of september . siemens under fire the closure has triggered fierce debate in germany .

" a world-class company such as siemens should not be allowed to steal out of bearing responsibility for people , " said bavaria 's ig metall boss , werner neugebauer . the trade union wants siemens to create a 200-million euro emergency program for the affected employees . siemens however has defended itself in the face of growing criticism . " so far we 've been the only ones to contribute substantial aid to the affected employees , without it being legally binding on us to do so , " said siemens spokesman , marc langendorf . he pointed to the special fund worth 35 million euros that siemens had created to support employees who lose their jobs as well as a job center to help employees find work in future . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens stops payment to benq in taiwan following benq 's decision to cease german production of mobile telephones , siemens has stopped payment of 117 million euros to benq 's taiwanese parent company .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe . " barroso is aiming to garner support at the summit for the eit , which would aim to rival the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- in the united states , although it would only be based on networks of academics and business people . in addition to discussing the eit , leaders will also focus on reviving long-stalled efforts to set up an eu patent system , which have floundered in the past over disputes about which languages to use . eu wants to be international elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has fallen behind other rich countries in technology and education education is seen as key to boosting innovation , especially because the average eu citizen is less educated than adults in other wealthy countries . in 2005 only 23 percent of the eu working population had tertiary education compared to 39 percent in the united states and 37 percent in japan , according to the european commission . while europe has traditionally measured its technological abilities against the united states and japan , it is increasingly looking at developments in china and india . a report by the german think-tank deutschland denken warned in a recent report that europe was in a " race to the top " with china and india to produce " ever higher value-added goods and services " that would determine future prosperity . but europe was ill-prepared because the willingness of policymakers to take up innovation was not matched by the investment in " human capital . " dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study reveals education gap in europe europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .
-lrb- 11.10.2006 -rrb- eu ministers cool on technology institute plans it is seen as a necessity in europe 's struggle to compete with the united states in the field of innovation , but the proposed european institute of technology has few supporters in the 25-nation bloc .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe . " barroso is aiming to garner support at the summit for the eit , which would aim to rival the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- in the united states , although it would only be based on networks of academics and business people . in addition to discussing the eit , leaders will also focus on reviving long-stalled efforts to set up an eu patent system , which have floundered in the past over disputes about which languages to use . eu wants to be international elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has fallen behind other rich countries in technology and education education is seen as key to boosting innovation , especially because the average eu citizen is less educated than adults in other wealthy countries . in 2005 only 23 percent of the eu working population had tertiary education compared to 39 percent in the united states and 37 percent in japan , according to the european commission . while europe has traditionally measured its technological abilities against the united states and japan , it is increasingly looking at developments in china and india . a report by the german think-tank deutschland denken warned in a recent report that europe was in a " race to the top " with china and india to produce " ever higher value-added goods and services " that would determine future prosperity . but europe was ill-prepared because the willingness of policymakers to take up innovation was not matched by the investment in " human capital . " dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study reveals education gap in europe europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid . among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said . the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little . thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is increasing poverty in berlin 's poor neukölln neighborhood , where these children live most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs . experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany . amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today . about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned . government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children . " you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child welfare group planted a field of flags representing 2.5 million impoverished children in germany as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week . among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month . this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . " on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families . democracy in danger ? finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy . in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties . german democracy could suffer in the long term if too many people fall into this category , seberich said . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany concerned about new " under-class " german politicians have become embroiled in a debate over poverty .
at the same time , a new study has identified a large group of germans who fear social and political isolation and feel abandoned by the state .
-lrb- 16.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

russian president vladimir putin will join them for dinner . to secure energy supplies from russia , eu leaders want russian president vladimir putin to sign an energy charter treaty that would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market .
but russia is not willing to yield to european demands and remains wary of foreign companies tapping into the country 's energy sources - as the russian ambassador in brussels , vladimir chizhov , said ahead of the friday meeting in lahti .
it is very likely that putin will not sign the proposed treaty that would also open up the european market for russian state-owned companies like gazprom a bit more . eu commission president jose manuel barroso , however , is convinced that greater cooperation in the energy sector would be in everybody 's interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso will have to do some smooth talking " it 's true that we have an interest in having russia as a credible , reliable supplier , " he said .
" it is also true that russia has all the interest in keeping europe , european union member states as the most important consumer they have . "
consumers as leverage europe , with its 500 million energy consumers , is the russia 's biggest market .
the eu gets about one-fifth of its oil and gas from russian sources .
eu members , especially those which were part of the soviet empire 15 years ago , distrust russian assurances that they would not suffer from shortages like ukraine did at the beginning of the year , when russia stopped the delivery of gas for several days to put pressure on the pro-western government in kiev .
barroso , though , says he is confident that this will not happen to the eu . " our leverage is precisely our market , " he said before the meeting .
" and this is the message we are going to convey in a constructive but firm way to president putin during that dinner . " eu countries are struggling to speak with one voice .
the nordic and the eastern states are much more critical of russia 's policies than france or spain .
eu leaders will try to convince putin that an inward , autocratic-sounding russia is not in its economic or strategic interest .
they will also express their growing concerns about the blockade on georgia , the murder of independent journalists and increasing economic nationalism .
cold war hangover on the other side of the table , the russian president fears that newer members from eastern europe are trying to turn the eu against russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is a huge market for natural gas " that is a hangover from the cold war , " said russian ambassador vladimir chizhov in brussels in an interview .

" nothing is more important for europe 's economic renewal than innovation , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday . " it is time now to turn talk into action , " he added .
" innovation is not some obscure business concept , it is essential to future jobs and growth in europe . " barroso is aiming to garner support at the summit for the eit , which would aim to rival the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- in the united states , although it would only be based on networks of academics and business people . in addition to discussing the eit , leaders will also focus on reviving long-stalled efforts to set up an eu patent system , which have floundered in the past over disputes about which languages to use . eu wants to be international elite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has fallen behind other rich countries in technology and education education is seen as key to boosting innovation , especially because the average eu citizen is less educated than adults in other wealthy countries . in 2005 only 23 percent of the eu working population had tertiary education compared to 39 percent in the united states and 37 percent in japan , according to the european commission . while europe has traditionally measured its technological abilities against the united states and japan , it is increasingly looking at developments in china and india . a report by the german think-tank deutschland denken warned in a recent report that europe was in a " race to the top " with china and india to produce " ever higher value-added goods and services " that would determine future prosperity . but europe was ill-prepared because the willingness of policymakers to take up innovation was not matched by the investment in " human capital . " dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study reveals education gap in europe europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .
-lrb- 11.10.2006 -rrb- eu ministers cool on technology institute plans it is seen as a necessity in europe 's struggle to compete with the united states in the field of innovation , but the proposed european institute of technology has few supporters in the 25-nation bloc .

officials in washington , however , said a first set of punitive measures was likely to focus on banning the supply of material and funding for iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear programs . other steps could include asset freezes and travel bans on nuclear and weapons scientists . discussions to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its right to uranium enrichment programs " i expect that iran will be coming -lrb- before the council -rrb- fairly soon , " japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , president of the 15-member council for october , told reporters thursday .
" it depends on the progress of consultations among key interested countries .
but nothing has been discussed yet . " france 's un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere said thursday he hoped a draft could be discussed friday by envoys from germany and the council 's five permanent members - the so-called p5 , which is comprised of britain , france , china , russia and the united . another diplomat said he did not anticipate a draft to be submitted to the full council before next week . " we will have a few days between the p5 + 1 meeting and the consultations -lrb- by the full council -rrb- so the russians and chinese have time to digest the draft , " he added . russia and china may counter sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , represented vitaly churkin , and china may reject sanctions last week senior diplomats from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - finalized a preliminary list of possible sanctions and directed their un envoys to begin drawing up a sanctions draft . their decision came after the european union concluded , following several rounds of fruitless talks with iran , that the issue must be handed back to the security council . but while the six powers agreed on the need for sanctions against tehran , russia and china , which both have important economic ties to iran and traditionally reluctant to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool , are likely to oppose biting sanctions . russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin indicated earlier this week that an accord on a draft would take some time . iranian president not yielding the west suspects that tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian atomic program .
but iran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only and argues it has every right to enrich uranium under the non-proliferation treaty . iran ignored an aug .
31 deadline set by the security council to freeze uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce nuclear reactor fuel but also for bomb-making . thursday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated in a speech in islamshahr , southwest of tehran , that his country would not back down . " the enrichment of uranium and having nuclear fuel are among the main demands of iranian nation , " he said . iran warned of radicalization wednesday , iran also warned the security council against imposing sanctions saying such a move would " radicalize " the situation and affect its cooperation with the un atomic agency . iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said us-led efforts to put a draft resolution to the security council would make ending the standoff even harder and even have consequences for the wider middle east region . last june the p5 and germany drew up a list of 15 possible punitive measures against iran as part of a " carrots and sticks " package that also included economic and security incentives if tehran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .
-lrb- 08.09.2006 -rrb- sanctions against iran could cost 10,000 german jobs as world powers gear up for a new round of diplomacy to respond to iran 's refusal to halt uranium enrichment , germany 's main trade group said the country could lose 10,000 jobs if tehran is slapped with sanctions .
-lrb- 01.09.2006 -rrb- defiant iran vows to press on with nuclear program iran on tuesday is expected to respond to an offer by the eu , us and others to solve the nuclear crisis .
but iran 's supreme leader already said his country will press on with its controversial nuclear work .

officials in washington , however , said a first set of punitive measures was likely to focus on banning the supply of material and funding for iran 's ballistic missile and nuclear programs . other steps could include asset freezes and travel bans on nuclear and weapons scientists . discussions to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran maintains its right to uranium enrichment programs " i expect that iran will be coming -lrb- before the council -rrb- fairly soon , " japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , president of the 15-member council for october , told reporters thursday .
" it depends on the progress of consultations among key interested countries .
but nothing has been discussed yet . " france 's un envoy jean-marc de la sabliere said thursday he hoped a draft could be discussed friday by envoys from germany and the council 's five permanent members - the so-called p5 , which is comprised of britain , france , china , russia and the united . another diplomat said he did not anticipate a draft to be submitted to the full council before next week . " we will have a few days between the p5 + 1 meeting and the consultations -lrb- by the full council -rrb- so the russians and chinese have time to digest the draft , " he added . russia and china may counter sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , represented vitaly churkin , and china may reject sanctions last week senior diplomats from britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - finalized a preliminary list of possible sanctions and directed their un envoys to begin drawing up a sanctions draft . their decision came after the european union concluded , following several rounds of fruitless talks with iran , that the issue must be handed back to the security council . but while the six powers agreed on the need for sanctions against tehran , russia and china , which both have important economic ties to iran and traditionally reluctant to use sanctions as a diplomatic tool , are likely to oppose biting sanctions . russia 's un envoy vitaly churkin indicated earlier this week that an accord on a draft would take some time . iranian president not yielding the west suspects that tehran is seeking to build nuclear weapons under the cover of its civilian atomic program .
but iran insists its program is for peaceful energy purposes only and argues it has every right to enrich uranium under the non-proliferation treaty . iran ignored an aug .
31 deadline set by the security council to freeze uranium enrichment , a process that can be used to produce nuclear reactor fuel but also for bomb-making . thursday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad repeated in a speech in islamshahr , southwest of tehran , that his country would not back down . " the enrichment of uranium and having nuclear fuel are among the main demands of iranian nation , " he said . iran warned of radicalization wednesday , iran also warned the security council against imposing sanctions saying such a move would " radicalize " the situation and affect its cooperation with the un atomic agency . iran 's top nuclear negotiator , ali larijani , said us-led efforts to put a draft resolution to the security council would make ending the standoff even harder and even have consequences for the wider middle east region . last june the p5 and germany drew up a list of 15 possible punitive measures against iran as part of a " carrots and sticks " package that also included economic and security incentives if tehran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de six powers discuss ' next steps in security council ' for iran the six world powers meeting in berlin discussed " the next steps in the security council , " a senior european diplomat said in a clear allusion to possible sanctions against iran over its nuclear program .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .
democracy in danger ?
finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .
he also called on society to change its attitudes , and " stop looking away from indications of child abuse . "
on monday , the state of saxony said it plans to implement an early-warning system for children in problem families .
democracy in danger ?
finally , an expert on right-wing extremism looked at the poverty discussion from a political angle , saying he was concerned that a growing social underclass could have grave consequences for democracy .
in an interview with the german press agency dpa , michael seberich , an extremism expert at the bertelsmann foundation , said election analysis shows that people who " have given up on the idea that politicians can help them in any way " either tend not to vote at all , or vote for extremist parties .

among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .

experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .

rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .

" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .
rather , some states – like bavaria – should quickly move toward implementing measures of their own , stoiber told a cabinet meeting in munich earlier this week .
among other things , the state was checking into making regular medical checkups for children mandatory instead of voluntary .
the state 's minister for social welfare , christa stewens , said she would present concrete suggestions next month .
this would be a good move because " in many cases , neglect and abuse can be recognized " in a medical checkup , he said .

experts have spoken out on both issues . amid an ongoing debate over growing poverty in germany , a new study shows that millions of needy people in the country are failing to take advantage of state aid .
among the people cited by the study are some two million employed people who do not receive pay supplements that they are entitled to , a study by the hans-böckler foundation said .
the foundation , which is closely tied to union groups in germany , said only 7.4 million of some 10 million qualified people actually take advantage of a supplementary payments for working people who earn too little .
thus , the statistics put out by the german government " only tell half the story about the needy in germany , " the foundation wrote .
" these people live in hidden poverty – as do a million children with them . " most often affected are qualified workers with part-time jobs who are unable to find full-time work , as well as families with three or more children .
in addition , there are 1.5 million households whose full-time pay nonetheless fails to cover their needs .
experts respond to child deaths on wednesday , another study came out that sheds light on the plight of impoverished children in germany .
amid reports of the unrelated deaths of two young children who died of mistreatment after they slipped through the child-welfare net , a study by social scientist klaus hurrelman estimated there are some 80,000 neglected children living in germany today .
about one percent of all german parents are completely outside of the social norms – they are severe alcoholics , drug addicts , or have serious psychological problems , the researcher told die zeit newspaper .
their children - generally between the ages of one and ten - live under the constant threat of catastrophe , he warned .
government measures called for hurrelman also noted that 15 percent of all parents have other serious problems with child rearing .
in some cases this is due to poverty or simply poor parenting practices .
he suggested the state take a more interventionist role – for example by tying the payment of child-rearing supplements to regular medical checkups for children .
" you do n't get very far with these people if you make action voluntary , " he said . as the whirlwind of media controversy over the deaths of the two children continued , bavarian premier edmund stoiber said he did not want to wait for the federal government to take measures to improve child welfare .

the reforms , brought in seven years ago , aimed to cut legal aid bills and speed cases through the sheriff courts .
but a report carried out for the scottish executive and released to bbc scotland under freedom of information legislation found they had failed .
the executive said the report was being considered in the context of wider reforms currently being undertaken .
the research , seen by bbc scotland , was carried out by academics from manchester and strathclyde universities .
it followed a request by the parliament 's justice 1 committee .

cardiff-based tenovus said almost 2,000 cases of the disease each year are linked to women 's alcohol intake .
it says almost one in five women drinks over three units of alcohol every day .
the department of health says one 175ml glass of wine is around two units .
simon morgan-jones , a specialist cancer nurse , said it was feared women were storing up health problems .
about 42,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year .
october is breast cancer awareness month and tenovus is asking women of all ages to look after their breasts and to stop binge drinking . "
it 's very easy to go over the daily recommended limit and the more you do that , the more you are increasing your risk of breast cancer and other diseases " simon morgan-jones mr morgan-jones said : " if you go into any town centre of a weekend night , you see kids of the age of 13-14 upwards , certainly drinking well over the recommended units a day and much more than is wise anyway .
" with breast cancer , it seem that excessive alcohol intake increases the amount of oestrogen in the body , and we know that overexposure to oestrogen is a risk factor , probably the biggest . "
" we would certainly recommend that women do not drink in excess on a regular basis .
' stoical ' " it would silly to say not to drink alcohol at all , but if you drink , then there will be occasions when you drink to excess .
" but it 's very easy to go over the daily recommended limit and the more you do that , the more you are increasing your risk of breast cancer and other diseases . "
the charity is also reminding men that they too have a small chance of contracting the disease .
about 300 of the 42,000 breast cancer cases annually are men .
although the numbers are small , they are increasing , said mr morgan-jones , who works as a specialist oncology nurse treating men with prostate cancer , at singleton hospital , swansea .
he said breast cancer tended to strike men in their 60s and 70s .
he said : " it 's very difficult for them .
at that age , they tend to be quite stoical about things and ignore the symptoms and think it 's part of ageing .

cardiff-based tenovus said almost 2,000 cases of the disease each year are linked to women 's alcohol intake .
it says almost one in five women drinks over three units of alcohol every day .
the department of health says one 175ml glass of wine is around two units .
simon morgan-jones , a specialist cancer nurse , said it was feared women were storing up health problems .
about 42,000 cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year .
october is breast cancer awareness month and tenovus is asking women of all ages to look after their breasts and to stop binge drinking .
it 's very easy to go over the daily recommended limit and the more you do that , the more you are increasing your risk of breast cancer and other diseases simon morgan-jones mr morgan-jones said : " if you go into any town centre of a weekend night , you see kids of the age of 13-14 upwards , certainly drinking well over the recommended units a day and much more than is wise anyway .
" with breast cancer , it seem that excessive alcohol intake increases the amount of oestrogen in the body , and we know that overexposure to oestrogen is a risk factor , probably the biggest . "
" we would certainly recommend that women do not drink in excess on a regular basis .
' stoical ' " it would silly to say not to drink alcohol at all , but if you drink , then there will be occasions when you drink to excess .
" but it 's very easy to go over the daily recommended limit and the more you do that , the more you are increasing your risk of breast cancer and other diseases . "
men can get breast cancer , though the number of cases are still small the charity is also reminding men that they too have a small chance of contracting the disease .
about 300 of the 42,000 breast cancer cases annually are men .
although the numbers are small , they are increasing , said mr morgan-jones , who works as a specialist oncology nurse treating men with prostate cancer , at singleton hospital , swansea .
he said breast cancer tended to strike men in their 60s and 70s .
he said : " it 's very difficult for them .
at that age , they tend to be quite stoical about things and ignore the symptoms and think it 's part of ageing .

many of the items on show belong to len hughes , 74 , whose father billy " kid " hughes fought out of maesteg .
the display , which opens on friday at neath museum , focuses on boxers past and present from the area .
billy hughes won the welsh fly-weight title before hanging up his gloves in 1935 to manage other fighters .
he started boxing in 1919 at the age of 16 after building a gym in his bedroom .
his son , who lives in aberavon , said : " he went all over britain to fight .
he had 382 fights - lost 22 and fought 22 champions in his career . "
mr hughes said at the time fights could last 20 rounds rather than the 12-round maximum today .
it was a hard living but he would always be fit so he could fight at short notice len hughes he said some would be in booths , where his father appeared alongside the likes of legendary heavyweight tommy farr - one of a handful of welshmen to win the british title at that division .
" my father was his own manager but he fought the best - he fought benny lynch who was one of the great fly-weights of the time .
" he was fighting so much he was earning three or four pounds weekly , which was a lot of money in them days .
" it was a hard living but he would always be fit so he could fight at short notice .
" he finished in 1935 and i was born in 1932 so i never saw him fight , but all the old-timers said he was very fast . "
' do n't forget ' billy hughes then went into management out of a gym at the angel hotel in maesteg until the early 1960s .
mr hughes said it was through attending events with his father , many at the gwyn hall in neath , that he was introduced to the sport .
he has collected hundreds of programmes and cards and these , alongside oil paintings and his father 's old gloves , make up part of the exhibition .
" after he finished boxing himself he was one of the biggest managers in wales and i went to a lot of the fights with him , " he added .
port talbot boxer darren edwards , who won a bronze medal for wales at this year 's commonwealth games in melbourne , will also be attending the exhibition 's opening .
" the port talbot area alone has five or six boxing gyms these days so it 's important to reflect the interest in the sport with an exhibition like this , " he said .

many of the items on show belong to len hughes , 74 , whose father billy " kid " hughes fought out of maesteg .
the display , which opens on friday at neath museum , focuses on boxers past and present from the area .
billy hughes won the welsh fly-weight title before hanging up his gloves in 1935 to manage other fighters .
he started boxing in 1919 at the age of 16 after building a gym in his bedroom .
his son , who lives in aberavon , said : " he went all over britain to fight .
he had 382 fights - lost 22 and fought 22 champions in his career . "
mr hughes said at the time fights could last 20 rounds rather than the 12-round maximum today . "
it was a hard living but he would always be fit so he could fight at short notice " len hughes he said some would be in booths , where his father appeared alongside the likes of legendary heavyweight tommy farr - one of a handful of welshmen to win the british title at that division .
" my father was his own manager but he fought the best - he fought benny lynch who was one of the great fly-weights of the time .
" he was fighting so much he was earning three or four pounds weekly , which was a lot of money in them days .
" it was a hard living but he would always be fit so he could fight at short notice .
" he finished in 1935 and i was born in 1932 so i never saw him fight , but all the old-timers said he was very fast . "
' do n't forget ' billy hughes then went into management out of a gym at the angel hotel in maesteg until the early 1960s .
mr hughes said it was through attending events with his father , many at the gwyn hall in neath , that he was introduced to the sport .
he has collected hundreds of programmes and cards and these , alongside oil paintings and his father 's old gloves , make up part of the exhibition .
" after he finished boxing himself he was one of the biggest managers in wales and i went to a lot of the fights with him , " he added .
port talbot boxer darren edwards , who won a bronze medal for wales at this year 's commonwealth games in melbourne , will also be attending the exhibition 's opening .
" the port talbot area alone has five or six boxing gyms these days so it 's important to reflect the interest in the sport with an exhibition like this , " he said .
" it 's also important that we do n't forget about names from the past like kid hughes . "

mel parry , an apprentice newspaper photographer in merthyr tydfil , snapped a shot of the rescue scene which contained a policeman carrying schoolgirl susan robertson -lrb- nee maybank -rrb- after she was pulled from the wreckage of pantglas primary school .
the school and nearby houses were covered with waste from a coal tip which slid down merthyr mountain behind the south wales village on 21 october 1966 , killing 116 children and 28 adults .
when blown up and cropped , the image of susan in the policeman 's arms appeared on the front page of papers across the world by the next day .
mr parry , who was 18 at the time , had got on the bus in aberfan to go to work in nearby merthyr tydfil when he heard there had been a coal waste slip at the school .
he said : " i got off the bus , saw it , rang the office and asked the chief photographer if he could bring some equipment down .
as soon as he arrived , i just started taking pictures .
" the photograph that everybody 's aware of i have no recollection of taking .
it was , from what i 'm led to understand , one of the first three that were ever taken of the site . "
" i wish i 'd never taken it , because i wish the disaster had never happened " mel parry the only thing he remembers is seeing a glint of light through the camera .
" i had no idea what it was at the time but after seeing the actual photograph i can see it was the top of the policeman 's helmet because that 's the only thing that was glinting .
" i saw the photograph later in the evening when the paper came out .
i did n't think anything of it , i did n't even think it was mine - i did n't find out until three days later , " he said .
mr parry went on to win news category of the british press photographer of the year in december that year , the youngest-ever recipient at the time .
it briefly brought him fame but it is not something he remembers with pleasure .
he said : " personally i wish i 'd never taken it , because i wish the disaster had never happened .
i just happened to be one person in the right place at the right time .
six or seven years later i got out of photography altogether .
" it gave me 15 minutes of fame on the back of a disaster and that is something i would not wish on anybody . "
' chain of men ' for susan robertson , the photograph has made her the repeated focus of attention over the years at successive anniversaries " it went worldwide and this is why every so many years , photographers and journalists always come looking for me , " she said .
" i remember every moment from that morning .
i was in the classroom and it all went black and there was a rumbling like thunder and this is when the tip hit the school .
" i was buried and i heard voices above my head .
i could hear the men , way above the window and they said there 's a little girl here .
" they asked me to put my hand through the inkwell of the desk but it was too small so i put my finger through and this is when they dug down and pulled me up .
" i was carried through a chain of men through the hall , of miners i should imagine , and they passed me from this one rescuer through a window to the policeman . "
mrs robertson said the reason she was crying in the photograph was because she had lost a shoe .
" my aunty alice -lsb- pictured next to her -rsb- was saying , ' come on susan , come on you 're all right ' .
i was glad to have seen her , then my mother came along .
" when i came home from hospital i saw the picture in the paper , and said to my mother and father , ' look , that 's me ' . "
the fact the picture became so famous was down to an observant darkroom assistant , alun john .
he was working at the south wales echo in cardiff the morning of the disaster when the roll of film taken by mel parry was brought in .
" when i got to the third frame , i could see that although it was of a general scene , there was obviously something quite important in the middle of the picture , " he said . "
forty minutes later it was on the front page of the echo and an hour later it had gone round the world " alun john " i pushed the enlarger up as high as i could and it still was n't big enough so i turned the enlarger around and shone it onto the floor .
" in the middle of the picture , i could see this policeman with the child in his arms and the very , very upset lady next to him .
" i immediately made a print of just this small section , processed it and dried it very quickly and literally ran it outside to the picture editor - quite excited i was by this stage .
" i said ' i think there 's possibly something more here than we thought in the first place ' .
he looked at it and went , ' yeah , you 're right ' and he ran off to the main newsroom .
" forty minutes later it was on the front page of the echo and an hour later it had gone round the world . "
mr john compared the impact of the photograph to the image from the 11 september world trade center attacks of a plane hitting the second tower .
" if you think what an iconic image that was on the day , exactly the same happened to -lsb- the aberfan picture -rsb- , " he said .
" that picture became the defining image of the story .
it was used on every front page of every national newspaper in this country , it was used in news bulletins , and news magazines overseas . "

mel parry , an apprentice newspaper photographer in merthyr tydfil , snapped a shot of the rescue scene which contained a policeman carrying schoolgirl susan robertson -lrb- nee maybank -rrb- after she was pulled from the wreckage of pantglas primary school .
the school and nearby houses were covered with waste from a coal tip which slid down merthyr mountain behind the south wales village on 21 october 1966 , killing 116 children and 28 adults .
when blown up and cropped , the image of susan in the policeman 's arms appeared on the front page of papers across the world by the next day .
mr parry , who was 18 at the time , had got on the bus in aberfan to go to work in nearby merthyr tydfil when he heard there had been a coal waste slip at the school .
he said : " i got off the bus , saw it , rang the office and asked the chief photographer if he could bring some equipment down .
as soon as he arrived , i just started taking pictures .
" the photograph that everybody 's aware of i have no recollection of taking .
it was , from what i 'm led to understand , one of the first three that were ever taken of the site . "
i wish i 'd never taken it , because i wish the disaster had never happened mel parry the only thing he remembers is seeing a glint of light through the camera .
" i had no idea what it was at the time but after seeing the actual photograph i can see it was the top of the policeman 's helmet because that 's the only thing that was glinting .
" i saw the photograph later in the evening when the paper came out .
i did n't think anything of it , i did n't even think it was mine - i did n't find out until three days later , " he said .
mr parry went on to win news category of the british press photographer of the year in december that year , the youngest-ever recipient at the time .
it briefly brought him fame but it is not something he remembers with pleasure .
he said : " personally i wish i 'd never taken it , because i wish the disaster had never happened .
i just happened to be one person in the right place at the right time .
six or seven years later i got out of photography altogether .
" it gave me 15 minutes of fame on the back of a disaster and that is something i would not wish on anybody . "
' chain of men ' for susan robertson , the photograph has made her the repeated focus of attention over the years at successive anniversaries " it went worldwide and this is why every so many years , photographers and journalists always come looking for me , " she said .
" i remember every moment from that morning .
i was in the classroom and it all went black and there was a rumbling like thunder and this is when the tip hit the school .
the picture has kept susan robertson in the public eye " i was buried and i heard voices above my head .
i could hear the men , way above the window and they said there 's a little girl here .
" they asked me to put my hand through the inkwell of the desk but it was too small so i put my finger through and this is when they dug down and pulled me up .
" i was carried through a chain of men through the hall , of miners i should imagine , and they passed me from this one rescuer through a window to the policeman . "
mrs robertson said the reason she was crying in the photograph was because she had lost a shoe .
" my aunty alice -lsb- pictured next to her -rsb- was saying , ' come on susan , come on you 're all right ' .
i was glad to have seen her , then my mother came along .
" when i came home from hospital i saw the picture in the paper , and said to my mother and father , ' look , that 's me ' . "
the fact the picture became so famous was down to an observant darkroom assistant , alun john .
he was working at the south wales echo in cardiff the morning of the disaster when the roll of film taken by mel parry was brought in .
" when i got to the third frame , i could see that although it was of a general scene , there was obviously something quite important in the middle of the picture , " he said .

a total of 116 children lost their lives when a coal waste tip slid down a mountain , engulfing a school and surrounding houses on 21 october 1966 .
first minister rhodri morgan was among those attending a public church service in nearby merthyr tydfil .
a private service will be held in aberfan cemetery on saturday .
representatives from aberfan 's memorial committee , parents who lost their children and some survivors were among those attending the public memorial at st mary 's church , merthyr tydfil , on thursday evening .
during his homily , father michael st.clair said : " yesterday i was asked several times , what do i think is the need for such a commemoration .
" we pray that all those who lost their lives are brought to that place of peace , light and happiness .
" why do we commemorate so many things ?
because we are a people who remember .
" why are we here in these valleys ?
coal is responsible .
" in those days they did n't realise what they were doing , in our days we are so concerned with global warming and the effect on the environment . "
it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same " cliff minett , father " what can we do to make things better for the future ? "
mr morgan called on the people of wales to remember those who died .
he said : " everyone can remember how they heard about aberfan .
" i first heard about it on the lunchtime news that day and found it hard to make sense of the horror of it - the fact that a primary school had been buried , that so many children had died and the scale of the rescue operation .
" this was the 1960s .
wales still had 100,000 miners and coal was king .
coal was so important that we all accepted - until aberfan - that there was a price to pay and we were all prepared to pay it .
" what we never foresaw was that coal could take the lives of our children .
that was new , and terrible . "
the slip happened just after pupils had arrived for classes at pantglas junior school on the last day before half-term that year .
the school and about two dozen houses were covered by the slide , which followed several days of heavy rain .
images of the tragedy were beamed around the world , prompting donations for a disaster fund which reached a total of £ 1.75m.
a tribunal found the national coal board was responsible for the disaster , but nobody was sacked or prosecuted .
readings at thursday 's service were given by councillor jeff edwards , who was one of the pupils that survived the disaster at pantglas .
the mayor of merthyr tydfil , ian clark , said : " we pray for the families and friends of all who died that they may draw comfort from their faith and the support of the community . "
cliff minett , who lost two of his three children in the disaster , said : " it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same . "

a total of 116 children lost their lives when a coal waste tip slid down a mountain , engulfing a school and surrounding houses on 21 october 1966 .
first minister rhodri morgan was among those attending a public church service in nearby merthyr tydfil .
a private service will be held in aberfan cemetery on saturday .
representatives from aberfan 's memorial committee , parents who lost their children and some survivors were among those attending the public memorial at st mary 's church , merthyr tydfil , on thursday evening .
during his homily , father michael st.clair said : " yesterday i was asked several times , what do i think is the need for such a commemoration .
the school and about two dozen houses were covered by the slide " we pray that all those who lost their lives are brought to that place of peace , light and happiness .
" why do we commemorate so many things ?
because we are a people who remember .
" why are we here in these valleys ?
coal is responsible .
" in those days they did n't realise what they were doing , in our days we are so concerned with global warming and the effect on the environment .
it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same cliff minett , father " what can we do to make things better for the future ? "
mr morgan called on the people of wales to remember those who died .
he said : " everyone can remember how they heard about aberfan .
" i first heard about it on the lunchtime news that day and found it hard to make sense of the horror of it - the fact that a primary school had been buried , that so many children had died and the scale of the rescue operation .
" this was the 1960s .
wales still had 100,000 miners and coal was king .
coal was so important that we all accepted - until aberfan - that there was a price to pay and we were all prepared to pay it .
survivor susan robertson is pulled from the rubble " what we never foresaw was that coal could take the lives of our children .
that was new , and terrible . "
the slip happened just after pupils had arrived for classes at pantglas junior school on the last day before half-term that year .
the school and about two dozen houses were covered by the slide , which followed several days of heavy rain .
images of the tragedy were beamed around the world , prompting donations for a disaster fund which reached a total of £ 1.75m.
a tribunal found the national coal board was responsible for the disaster , but nobody was sacked or prosecuted .
readings at thursday 's service were given by councillor jeff edwards , who was one of the pupils that survived the disaster at pantglas .
the mayor of merthyr tydfil , ian clark , said : " we pray for the families and friends of all who died that they may draw comfort from their faith and the support of the community . "
cliff minett , who lost two of his three children in the disaster , said : " it does n't matter if it 's one year or 40 years on - the pain is just the same . "

viewpoint matt prescott consumer choice is not going to deliver the goods to combat climate change , argues dr matt prescott .
in this week 's green room , he says the world needs strong political leadership , not just market forces , because there is no sale-or-return guarantee for the planet . "
during world war ii , a large share of humanity stared into the abyss .
in the unforgiving conditions , traumatised by their collective experience , almost everyone wanted to build a better , safer and fairer world .
they accepted this meant sharing some of their wealth and freedoms with others for the common good .
public hospitals and schools were built , living standards were deliberately raised and ancient class divisions were broken down .
later , as the developed world came to feel more comfortable and less vulnerable , many started to begrudge the spending of their money on such intangible , long-term benefits ; the post-war contract between citizens and their states started to break down . "
why should consumer choice be treated as sacrosanct ? "
by the 1980s , politicians such as margaret thatcher and ronald reagan had even started to suggest that there was " no such thing as society " .
investors could single-handedly make the world a better place and any constraint on trade , such as a nasty old law , was quickly labelled as a burdensome hindrance .
the rhetoric proved to be hugely successful electorally in many countries ; and while reagan and thatcher once stood at the fringes of political thought , their view of personal and consumer choice as an article of faith has become mainstream .
even financial disasters such as enron , the looming pensions " time-bomb " , and hurricane katrina do not seem to have fundamentally shaken the widespread belief that the market will one day , somehow , mystically solve our problems .
buyer beware but why should consumer choice be sacrosanct ?
are consumers best placed to make informed choices ?
are there not situations where a bit of straightforward regulation might be more effective ?
it was as far back as 1951 that sir richard doll first showed the link between smoking and lung cancer ; yet consumers still choose to buy cigarettes .
clearly , having a good evidence base is not enough on its own to produce sensible decisions .
in the case of climate change , our scientific understanding is increasingly robust , and it is becoming inevitable that we will have to reduce our carbon emissions drastically .
but we simply do not like the implications ; we have become emotionally attached to our fossil fuel lifestyles and status symbols .
false economy governments and businesses , of course , need to remain popular .
for businesses this means selling as cheaply as possible ; for governments , giving us jam today as well as promising it tomorrow .
so who will take responsibility for unleashing the potential solutions to global climate change ?
in the view of many , leadership from our elected representatives is essential .
this is especially true when it comes to changing the rules under which individuals and businesses compete , and making the hard choices for the long-term good of society .
by contrast , maintaining a business-as-usual approach merely encourages consumers to continue buying cheap , inefficient , technologies .
another insidious side effect of governments not giving leadership is that businesses fear being undercut and losing market share , should they ever incur discretionary yet responsible costs which are being avoided by their competitors .
undoubtedly , breaking this paralysis will require immense moral courage .
for courage , leaders of today need only to look back in time a little and see what their predecessors did .
for example , the hard-won ban against slavery deliberately went against what was considered economically justified .
prior to this ban , people had been free to own slaves for hundreds of years , and many could see nothing wrong with continuing to do so .
now it will never be reversed , and the world economy has adjusted to operating in ways which do not require the exploitation associated with slavery .
similarly , markets now need to be forced to address , and to assimilate , the environmental and social costs associated with climate change , and to move on to a higher playing field .
act now or pay later today 's competitive pressures and short-term profits simply should not be allowed to justify emissions standards and carbon prices being kept permanently low , at untold long-term cost .
insurance firm axa has recently estimated that , without action , climate change could be costing the uk economy in excess of £ 42bn per year by 2080 .
if we started now , spreading the costs and inconvenience over the coming decades , preventing catastrophic climate change could be relatively affordable . "
i do n't want more things , i want better things " edina monsoon , fictional tv character send us your views alternatively , if we continued to delay action or suddenly decided to do everything we could in a panic , the costs and disruption could be enormous .
crucial technologies or economic activities that are dependent on fossil fuels might be impossible to replace at short notice , and this could be disastrous for our entire civilisation .
it will not be easy , but we must learn to accept that consumer choice can not be expected to solve complex , large-scale problems .
governments have to step up to the plate and to step in with legislation when it is needed ; giving all the responsibility to markets and consumers is not good enough .
actor jennifer saunder 's fictional comic fashion guru and arch-consumer , edina monsoon , once wisely said , " i do n't want more things , i want better things " , and she was right .
we must find the courage to remove the worst products from the market , to build environmental costs into prices , and give the low-carbon alternatives a half-decent chance of getting established .
consumers will then take care of the rest . "

viewpoint matt prescott consumer choice is not going to deliver the goods to combat climate change , argues dr matt prescott .
in this week 's green room , he says the world needs strong political leadership , not just market forces , because there is no sale-or-return guarantee for the planet .
a whole generation survived without the luxury of choice during world war ii , a large share of humanity stared into the abyss .
in the unforgiving conditions , traumatised by their collective experience , almost everyone wanted to build a better , safer and fairer world .
they accepted this meant sharing some of their wealth and freedoms with others for the common good .
public hospitals and schools were built , living standards were deliberately raised and ancient class divisions were broken down .
later , as the developed world came to feel more comfortable and less vulnerable , many started to begrudge the spending of their money on such intangible , long-term benefits ; the post-war contract between citizens and their states started to break down .
why should consumer choice be treated as sacrosanct ?
by the 1980s , politicians such as margaret thatcher and ronald reagan had even started to suggest that there was " no such thing as society " .
investors could single-handedly make the world a better place and any constraint on trade , such as a nasty old law , was quickly labelled as a burdensome hindrance .
the rhetoric proved to be hugely successful electorally in many countries ; and while reagan and thatcher once stood at the fringes of political thought , their view of personal and consumer choice as an article of faith has become mainstream .
even financial disasters such as enron , the looming pensions " time-bomb " , and hurricane katrina do not seem to have fundamentally shaken the widespread belief that the market will one day , somehow , mystically solve our problems .
buyer beware but why should consumer choice be sacrosanct ?
are consumers best placed to make informed choices ?
are there not situations where a bit of straightforward regulation might be more effective ?
information alone does not always produce the informed choice it was as far back as 1951 that sir richard doll first showed the link between smoking and lung cancer ; yet consumers still choose to buy cigarettes .
clearly , having a good evidence base is not enough on its own to produce sensible decisions .
in the case of climate change , our scientific understanding is increasingly robust , and it is becoming inevitable that we will have to reduce our carbon emissions drastically .
but we simply do not like the implications ; we have become emotionally attached to our fossil fuel lifestyles and status symbols .
false economy governments and businesses , of course , need to remain popular .
for businesses this means selling as cheaply as possible ; for governments , giving us jam today as well as promising it tomorrow .
so who will take responsibility for unleashing the potential solutions to global climate change ?
in the view of many , leadership from our elected representatives is essential .
this is especially true when it comes to changing the rules under which individuals and businesses compete , and making the hard choices for the long-term good of society .
shoppers make choices based on price not environmental profile by contrast , maintaining a business-as-usual approach merely encourages consumers to continue buying cheap , inefficient , technologies .
another insidious side effect of governments not giving leadership is that businesses fear being undercut and losing market share , should they ever incur discretionary yet responsible costs which are being avoided by their competitors .
undoubtedly , breaking this paralysis will require immense moral courage .
for courage , leaders of today need only to look back in time a little and see what their predecessors did .
for example , the hard-won ban against slavery deliberately went against what was considered economically justified .
prior to this ban , people had been free to own slaves for hundreds of years , and many could see nothing wrong with continuing to do so .
now it will never be reversed , and the world economy has adjusted to operating in ways which do not require the exploitation associated with slavery .
similarly , markets now need to be forced to address , and to assimilate , the environmental and social costs associated with climate change , and to move on to a higher playing field .
act now or pay later today 's competitive pressures and short-term profits simply should not be allowed to justify emissions standards and carbon prices being kept permanently low , at untold long-term cost .

pet shops in northern ireland are selling sedatives to help dogs cope with the explosive bangs of halloween fireworks .
the tablets are aimed at ending the upset caused by the sudden loud bangs of exploding fireworks .
pet shop owner jackie mccourt said the sedatives did not knock dogs out , but they made them less stressed .
but a local vet has urged people to consider playing cds of fireworks to desensitise animals to the noise .
ms mccourt , who owns the pet stop on belfast 's upper newtownards road said the demand for tranquilisers increased at halloween , as customers worried about the effects of fireworks on their animals .
" the dogs are petrified .
they go into hiding and are very nervous .
it is not a great sedative .
it is not going to knock them out .
but it calms them down and makes them less stressed , " she explained .
the drugs can also be used for hyperactive or aggressive dogs .
alternative therapy " people just do n't stop to think , unless you have an animal like that and are in that situation , people wo n't stop to think , " she said .
craig reilly , chairman of the northern ireland branch of the british small animal veterinary association , urged dog owners to consider alternative ways of calming their pets .
using diazepam or valium is " old fashioned " , he said .
" it is about re-education , " he said .
" it is a behavioural problem .
what we are trying to do is to educate people to desensitise the dog .
if you introduce the noise very quietly - you can buy cds with fireworks on them - play them at a low volume , build up the volume over a number of days and the dogs realise they do n't need to worry . "
mr reilly also suggested a product , like a plug-in air freshener , which produces a calming hormone into the air to soothe the dog .

pet shops in northern ireland are selling sedatives to help dogs cope with the explosive bangs of halloween fireworks .
the tablets are aimed at ending the upset caused by the sudden loud bangs of exploding fireworks .
pet shop owner jackie mccourt said the sedatives did not knock dogs out , but they made them less stressed .
but a local vet has urged people to consider playing cds of fireworks to desensitise animals to the noise .
ms mccourt , who owns the pet stop on belfast 's upper newtownards road said the demand for tranquilisers increased at halloween , as customers worried about the effects of fireworks on their animals .
" the dogs are petrified .
they go into hiding and are very nervous .
it is not a great sedative .
it is not going to knock them out .
but it calms them down and makes them less stressed , " she explained .
the drugs can also be used for hyperactive or aggressive dogs .
alternative therapy " people just do n't stop to think , unless you have an animal like that and are in that situation , people wo n't stop to think , " she said .
craig reilly , chairman of the northern ireland branch of the british small animal veterinary association , urged dog owners to consider alternative ways of calming their pets .
using diazepam or valium is " old fashioned " , he said .
" it is about re-education , " he said .
" it is a behavioural problem .
what we are trying to do is to educate people to desensitise the dog .
if you introduce the noise very quietly - you can buy cds with fireworks on them - play them at a low volume , build up the volume over a number of days and the dogs realise they do n't need to worry . "
mr reilly also suggested a product , like a plug-in air freshener , which produces a calming hormone into the air to soothe the dog .

the south west regional development authority -lrb- rda -rrb- is to compulsorily purchase south crofty tin mine .
the last working tin mine in europe was closed in 1998 and bought in 2001 by mining firm baseresult holdings .
but promises of restarting the mine have not materialised and the rda now wants to redevelop the site .
baseresult said it would fight the decision .
the decision is a very positive step for the whole area nick buckland tell bbc cornwall what you think when south crofty closed it ended a 3,000-year-old tin mining tradition in cornwall .
baseresult said after it bought south crofty that it would be mining tin within two years , working towards a workforce of 200 people .
but from the start there was official scepticism and the rda and other regeneration agencies doubted baseresult could succeed .
there were 340 tin mines in cornwall at the industry 's peak even the camborne , pool and redruth urban regeneration company suggested tin mining was not the sort of industry a modern county needed .
but early talk of compulsory purchase aroused some local anger and the agencies backed off .
finally their patience has run out and it is being announced on friday that the rda will lead compulsory purchase of 147 acres at pool , including the mine .
nick buckland , deputy chairman of the rda , said the land would be redeveloped with a mixture of leisure and industrial use as well as housing .
he said : " the decision is a very positive step for the whole area .
" we will be delivering up to 2,000 new jobs and 600 new homes .
" this land is essential for regeneration . "
we have to grasp this opportunity to move this area forward mark kazcmarek , former south crofty miner the mine workings would be protected so that tin mining could resume if it became economically viable .
when the mine closed , it was producing a relatively small 2,100 tonnes of tin per year .
mark kazcmarek , a former south crofty tin miner and a county councillor , said : " we have listened to baseresult 's promises and we supported them .
" but we are eight years down and now the time has come for change .
" we have to grasp this opportunity to move this area forward . "
baseresult said the company would be fighting the decision , but declined to comment any further .

the south west regional development authority -lrb- rda -rrb- is to compulsorily purchase south crofty tin mine .
the last working tin mine in europe was closed in 1998 and bought in 2001 by mining firm baseresult holdings .
but promises of restarting the mine have not materialised and the rda now wants to redevelop the site .
baseresult said it would fight the decision .
the decision is a very positive step for the whole area nick buckland tell bbc cornwall what you think when south crofty closed it ended a 3,000-year-old tin mining tradition in cornwall .
baseresult said after it bought south crofty that it would be mining tin within two years , working towards a workforce of 200 people .
but from the start there was official scepticism and the rda and other regeneration agencies doubted baseresult could succeed .
there were 340 tin mines in cornwall at the industry 's peak even the camborne , pool and redruth urban regeneration company suggested tin mining was not the sort of industry a modern county needed .
but early talk of compulsory purchase aroused some local anger and the agencies backed off .
finally their patience has run out and it is being announced on friday that the rda will lead compulsory purchase of 147 acres at pool , including the mine .
nick buckland , deputy chairman of the rda , said the land would be redeveloped with a mixture of leisure and industrial use as well as housing .
he said : " the decision is a very positive step for the whole area .
" we will be delivering up to 2,000 new jobs and 600 new homes .
" this land is essential for regeneration . "
we have to grasp this opportunity to move this area forward mark kazcmarek , former south crofty miner the mine workings would be protected so that tin mining could resume if it became economically viable .
when the mine closed , it was producing a relatively small 2,100 tonnes of tin per year .
mark kazcmarek , a former south crofty tin miner and a county councillor , said : " we have listened to baseresult 's promises and we supported them .
" but we are eight years down and now the time has come for change .
" we have to grasp this opportunity to move this area forward . "
baseresult said the company would be fighting the decision , but declined to comment any further .

the south west regional development authority -lrb- rda -rrb- is to compulsorily purchase south crofty tin mine .
the last working tin mine in europe was closed in 1998 and bought in 2001 by mining firm baseresult holdings .
but promises of restarting the mine have not materialised and the rda now wants to redevelop the site .
baseresult said it would fight the decision .
the decision is a very positive step for the whole area nick buckland tell bbc cornwall what you think when south crofty closed it ended a 3,000-year-old tin mining tradition in cornwall .
baseresult said after it bought south crofty that it would be mining tin within two years , working towards a workforce of 200 people .
but from the start there was official scepticism and the rda and other regeneration agencies doubted baseresult could succeed .
there were 340 tin mines in cornwall at the industry 's peak even the camborne , pool and redruth urban regeneration company suggested tin mining was not the sort of industry a modern county needed .
but early talk of compulsory purchase aroused some local anger and the agencies backed off .
finally their patience has run out and it is being announced on friday that the rda will lead compulsory purchase of 147 acres at pool , including the mine .
nick buckland , deputy chairman of the rda , said the land would be redeveloped with a mixture of leisure and industrial use as well as housing .
he said : " the decision is a very positive step for the whole area .
" we will be delivering up to 2,000 new jobs and 600 new homes .
" this land is essential for regeneration . "
we have to grasp this opportunity to move this area forward mark kazcmarek , former south crofty miner the mine workings would be protected so that tin mining could resume if it became economically viable .
when the mine closed , it was producing a relatively small 2,100 tonnes of tin per year .

splinter cell has become one of the most important videogame franchises in recent years and helped redefine third-person stealth titles .
the fourth outing is the most radical change yet - not because the gameplay mechanics have been altered dramatically but because the element of choice in your actions has become inescapable .
double agent explores the moral complexity of a spy 's life - having to make life or death decisions when the ethical outcome is not always clear .
the narrative of previous splinter cell games has always been a mix of the dynamic and the hackneyed but in double agent the balance is to the former rather than the latter .
the weakness in computer games is traditionally the realisation that your sense of choice and of freedom actually leads you to the same conclusion no matter which path you take .
but in double agent you actually feel as though your decisions count .
splinter cell : double agent format : multi , xbox 360 -lrb- reviewed -rrb- graphics : 9 sound : 9 gameplay : 8 enduring appeal : 8 overall : 8.5 the first level is a primer for the game - infiltrating a geothermal plant in iceland with a young sidekick .
the game 's designers have generated real atmosphere and a sense of place .
throughout the game you get to explore parts of shanghai , iceland , and large ships , tankers and office buildings galore .
variety of actions in these locations is also impressive - rappelling off a skyscraper in shanghai is a real highlight .
visually the game is stunning , using the high dynamic range of high definition gaming to great effect .
the musical score is spot on , rising and falling in tempo with the slightest change in action .
at the end of the first level sam is left rock bottom with two great losses in his life .
this emotional turmoil then permeates the rest of the game and sets the scene for the moral choices you must make as sam fisher .
early on sam finds himself in the company of a group of terrorists called the jba and in these levels there is a range of tasks to complete with a number of sub-objectives .
the tasks are engaging and give rise to plenty of opportunity to explore the landscapes / environments in which they are set .
this is old school stealth - creeping around with high tension and high stakes .
the control mechanism of splinter cell remains largely intact - the developers have also worked hard to ensure that the fancy moves and cool equipment get used and while the signposting might irritate some , it does make the game feel more rounded .
the big development of the title is in the use of directed moments .
these are interactive situations that force you to make a difficult choice in a tense situation .
the first is having to decide whether to kill a helicopter pilot : if you kill him you gain the trust of the jba but an innocent man dies .
if you do not , you lose the jba 's trust , but grow the confidence of the national security agency and keep a man alive .
they are interesting choices - not least because as video gamers we are used to arbitrarily killing characters with little thought to consequences .
as the game progresses , the decisions get tougher and tougher leading to decisions that could cause the deaths of thousands of innocents .
ubisoft has managed to inject real originality and innovation in a five-year-old franchise and produced the best stealth game i have played to date .
and the multiplayer element is still one of the best twists on online action around .
snake has got his work cut out if he is to top this game in the next metal gear game for playstation 3 .

splinter cell has become one of the most important videogame franchises in recent years and helped redefine third-person stealth titles .
the fourth outing is the most radical change yet - not because the gameplay mechanics have been altered dramatically but because the element of choice in your actions has become inescapable .
double agent explores the moral complexity of a spy 's life - having to make life or death decisions when the ethical outcome is not always clear .
the narrative of previous splinter cell games has always been a mix of the dynamic and the hackneyed but in double agent the balance is to the former rather than the latter .
the weakness in computer games is traditionally the realisation that your sense of choice and of freedom actually leads you to the same conclusion no matter which path you take .
but in double agent you actually feel as though your decisions count .
splinter cell : double agent format : multi , xbox 360 -lrb- reviewed -rrb- graphics : 9 sound : 9 gameplay : 8 enduring appeal : 8 overall : 8.5 the first level is a primer for the game - infiltrating a geothermal plant in iceland with a young sidekick .
the game 's designers have generated real atmosphere and a sense of place .
throughout the game you get to explore parts of shanghai , iceland , and large ships , tankers and office buildings galore .
variety of actions in these locations is also impressive - rappelling off a skyscraper in shanghai is a real highlight .
visually the game is stunning , using the high dynamic range of high definition gaming to great effect .
the musical score is spot on , rising and falling in tempo with the slightest change in action .
at the end of the first level sam is left rock bottom with two great losses in his life .
this emotional turmoil then permeates the rest of the game and sets the scene for the moral choices you must make as sam fisher .
early on sam finds himself in the company of a group of terrorists called the jba and in these levels there is a range of tasks to complete with a number of sub-objectives .
the tasks are engaging and give rise to plenty of opportunity to explore the landscapes / environments in which they are set .
this is old school stealth - creeping around with high tension and high stakes .
the control mechanism of splinter cell remains largely intact - the developers have also worked hard to ensure that the fancy moves and cool equipment get used and while the signposting might irritate some , it does make the game feel more rounded .
the big development of the title is in the use of directed moments .
these are interactive situations that force you to make a difficult choice in a tense situation .
the first is having to decide whether to kill a helicopter pilot : if you kill him you gain the trust of the jba but an innocent man dies .
if you do not , you lose the jba 's trust , but grow the confidence of the national security agency and keep a man alive .

splinter cell has become one of the most important videogame franchises in recent years and helped redefine third-person stealth titles .
the fourth outing is the most radical change yet - not because the gameplay mechanics have been altered dramatically but because the element of choice in your actions has become inescapable .
double agent explores the moral complexity of a spy 's life - having to make life or death decisions when the ethical outcome is not always clear .
the narrative of previous splinter cell games has always been a mix of the dynamic and the hackneyed but in double agent the balance is to the former rather than the latter .
the weakness in computer games is traditionally the realisation that your sense of choice and of freedom actually leads you to the same conclusion no matter which path you take .
but in double agent you actually feel as though your decisions count .
splinter cell : double agent format : multi , xbox 360 -lrb- reviewed -rrb- graphics : 9 sound : 9 gameplay : 8 enduring appeal : 8 overall : 8.5 the first level is a primer for the game - infiltrating a geothermal plant in iceland with a young sidekick .
the game 's designers have generated real atmosphere and a sense of place .
throughout the game you get to explore parts of shanghai , iceland , and large ships , tankers and office buildings galore .
variety of actions in these locations is also impressive - rappelling off a skyscraper in shanghai is a real highlight .
visually the game is stunning , using the high dynamic range of high definition gaming to great effect .
the musical score is spot on , rising and falling in tempo with the slightest change in action .
at the end of the first level sam is left rock bottom with two great losses in his life .
this emotional turmoil then permeates the rest of the game and sets the scene for the moral choices you must make as sam fisher .
early on sam finds himself in the company of a group of terrorists called the jba and in these levels there is a range of tasks to complete with a number of sub-objectives .

areas earmarked for the high tech mosquito sirens include parts of immingham and the nunsthorpe estate .
the sirens emit a high pitched ultra sonic blast and will be used to disperse groups of youths who gather to cause disturbances .
the devices have already been used in parts of hull and lancashire .
north east lincolnshire council said it was a temporary measure to move on youths causing trouble in an area , while work was carried out to find a more permanent solution .
' no complaints ' the mobile devices , which cost £ 500 each , will initially be fitted to buildings , but will be moved to a number of locations after consultation with local businesses and residents .
the siren , which the council says is " extremely annoying " for those who can hear it , relies on the effects of age-related hearing loss .
the authority said research had shown the mosquito could be clearly heard by the under 20s , while those over 25 struggled to hear it at all .
julie ann taylor , community safety and development manager for the council , said : " the mosquito devices are particularly intended to affect the ears of those under the age of 25 and have proven effective when used in other areas .
" while some people over 25 have stated they have heard a noise when mosquito 's have been used , no complaints have ever been recorded . "

the move comes after italy published its 2007 budget and many analysts complained that it did not do enough to put the country 's finances in order .
italy is struggling to come to terms with pension and healthcare problems , as well as a lack of competitiveness .
mr prodi won elections in april by promising to improve italy 's finances .
european leader italy currently has the highest debt levels in the european union , and is third in the world behind japan and the us .
at the same time , its budget deficit is expected to hit 4.8 % this year , well above the eu limit of 3 % of gross domestic product .
mr prodi , who has a one-seat majority in parliament , is trying to push through his 2007 budget by the end of this year .
critics of the budget argue that it focuses on raising revenues , mainly through higher taxes , and does not take a heavy enough axe to state spending .
part of the problem for mr prodi has been that he is head of a broad-ranging left-wing coalition that won the closest general election in italy 's tortured political history .
as a result , mr prodi has had to try to produce a budget that promoted business and economic interests at the same time as protecting workers ' rights , the healthcare system and pension payments .
" the downgrade reflects the new government 's inadequate response to italy 's structural economic and fiscal challenges , " said s & p 's credit analyst moritz kramer .
next assessments s & p cut italy 's debt rating to a + from aa- , claiming that the 2007 budget would boost spending as a share of the total economy , rather than curbing it .

but what the bulldozers uncovered was an ancient world of the dead - a roman necropolis , or burial site , dating back to the time of christ .
since then the excavations have brought to light more than 200 tombs , arranged on multiple levels and in remarkable condition .
in addition to funerary inscriptions they have uncovered a wide assortment of statues , vases , terracotta urns , coins and skeletons .
the burial site paints a complex picture of life and death in ancient rome and for the first time gives archaeologists a valuable insight into the life of lower- and middle-class romans .
simple artisans some of them were simple artisans , buried with clues to their trade .
in the tomb of a set designer for pompey 's theatre , there are the symbols of a compass and a t-square .
there are the tombs of a letter carrier , a circus horse trainer and a slave who was freed and later rose to a respected position in the household staff of the emperor nero .
but they have also uncovered skeletons of paupers , possibly slaves , who were buried without names and in simple wooden caskets .
" we found a little pompeii of funeral life , " said giandomenico spinola , head of the vatican museums ' classical antiquities department .
" we have had the mausoleums of hadrian and augustus , " mr spinola said .
" but in rome we are short of these middle- and lower-class burial places . "
in some parts of the necropolis lie the tombs of much wealthier romans .
some of them are complete with ornate funeral altars .
the inscriptions help to fill out family trees and they provide an important insight into daily life .
there is the sarcophagus of a male member of ancient rome 's class of knights , who died as a teenager and was remembered in death with a sculptured figure with hands outstretched as if in prayer .
the kind of figure known as an orante was widely taken as an early symbol of christianity .
before archaeologists could begin the excavation , they had to clear tons of dirt and rock .
in the second century there had been a landslip on the hill which helped preserve some of the tombs .
dionysus ' mosaic black-and-white mosaic flooring was unearthed depicting dionysus , an ancient god of fertility and wine , along with a grape harvest scene .
it has all been carefully restored in the vatican museums ' laboratory and placed back in its original location .
from specially constructed walkways , visitors can look down on the skeletons , including that of an infant buried by loved ones who left a hen 's egg beside the body .
the egg , whose smashed shell was reconstructed , was either a play thing or perhaps was left by the family as a symbol of rebirth .
throughout the necropolis there are a number of terracotta pipes that emerge from the tombs .
in ancient times families would sit by the grave and picnic , occasionally pouring wine , milk or honey down the pipe to feed the dead .
originally the necropolis ran along the edges of an ancient roman road , the via triumphalis -lrb- triumphal way -rrb- .
now we know that the area uncovered is just a small section of a much bigger necropolis that would have covered a large part of the hill .
but many of the secrets will remain buried .
archaeological digs like this are expensive - the work carried out so far has cost the vatican around 400,000 euros -lrb- £ 268,851 -rrb- - and the current site is now surrounded by the imposing stone pillars of the new multi-storey car park .
the advance of the modern world has , for the time being , put paid to any further excavations .

since then the excavations have brought to light more than 200 tombs , arranged on multiple levels and in remarkable condition .
in addition to funerary inscriptions they have uncovered a wide assortment of statues , vases , terracotta urns , coins and skeletons .
the burial site paints a complex picture of life and death in ancient rome and for the first time gives archaeologists a valuable insight into the life of lower- and middle-class romans .

in the tomb of a set designer for pompey 's theatre , there are the symbols of a compass and a t-square .

before archaeologists could begin the excavation , they had to clear tons of dirt and rock .
in the second century there had been a landslip on the hill which helped preserve some of the tombs .
dionysus ' mosaic black-and-white mosaic flooring was unearthed depicting dionysus , an ancient god of fertility and wine , along with a grape harvest scene .

the meeting will focus on securing stable energy supplies - something mr blair will argue is closely linked to climate change .
in a letter published ahead of the summit , the prime minister said europe must lead the world in changing to a low-carbon economy .
he said the world faced a " catastrophic tipping point " over climate change .
the letter , which was also signed by dutch pm jan peter balkenende , warned that failure to act would affect economic growth and long-term energy supply and would cause conflict and insecurity .
we have a window of only 10 to 15 years to take the steps we need to avoid crossing catastrophic tipping points joint letter energy is top of the agenda for the summit , where the eu leaders will be joined for dinner by russian president vladimir putin .
they hope to negotiate better deals for oil and gas companies operating in russia and better access to the russian pipeline network .
mr blair says it is right to focus on external energy policy but the pace of climate change means the two are linked .
" we have a window of only 10 to 15 years to take the steps we need to avoid crossing catastrophic tipping points , " the letter warns .
" these would have serious consequences for our economic growth prospects , the safety of our people and the supply of resources , most notably energy . "
debate commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday that climate change was the most pressing problem for political leaders .
and a plan to cut europe 's energy consumption by 20 % before 2020 has been outlined by the european commission .
no new decisions will come out of the lahti meeting , but mr blair wants an " in-depth debate " at another summit next year .
he also wants progressively tighter limits to be put on total co2 emissions from industry , and an agreement to invest more in renewable energy technology .
greenpeace 's john sauven said mr blair 's record on the climate issue was hypocritical .
" he finally grasps that we do n't have long to stop catastrophic climate change but in his decade in power co2 emissions have gone up in britain , " the campaigner said .
" he says he wants to strengthen the european emissions trading scheme , but last year he was suing brussels to weaken it .
he 's done nothing to combat aviation or the trend for gas-guzzling cars . "
