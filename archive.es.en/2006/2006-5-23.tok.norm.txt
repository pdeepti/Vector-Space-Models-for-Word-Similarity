program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.05.2006 can the world cup withstand heated race debate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says neo-nazi protesters should n't abuse the world cup germany is working hard to prevent the far right from hijacking the soccer world cup and promote a positive image weeks before the event opens .
will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .

but the watchdog group 's german branch saw positive developments last year as well . in its annual report on the human rights situation in some 140 countries , amnesty international lambasted rich nations for focusing their efforts on security rather than fighting poverty .
it also noted growing proof of a secret prison partnership between the middle east and the west in the " war on terror . " the human rights watchdog condemned countries , including the us , china and russia , of diluting efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere , such as sudan 's darfur region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refugee who fled darfur , sudan , for chad " governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests , sacrificed principles in the name of the ' war on terror ' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights abuses , " amnesty 's secretary general irene khan said in a statement released with the report . secret prison partnership the report also said a growing body of evidence showed that there is a secret prison partnership between western and middle eastern countries in the " war on terror , " resulting in widespread human rights abuses .
and it blamed us-led and iraqi security forces for " grave human rights violations , " with thousands being held without charge or trial in us detention centers , such as guantanamo prison . meanwhile , barbara lochbihler , head of the german branch of amnesty international , ai deutschland , noted some positive tendencies in human rights compared with last year 's report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler , head of ai deutschland for instance , last year the us government passed a law forbidding torture by us civil servants , even abroad .
" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration .

the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2006 wild bear leaves bavaria after officials order him killed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bear has left a few traces , such as these hairs caught on barbed wire a wild brown bear has been sighted in germany for the first time in over 170 years .
after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .
but this guy is different , and it makes life dangerous close to him . " searchi n g for alter n atives there is still a chance that the bear might be discovered and caught alive by animal welfare agencies , but finding a home could prove difficult .
officials at the munich zoo have said they wo n't put a wild bear in a cage because it wo n't get along with its tamer brown bears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bear - which looks similar to this one - survive his bavarian outing ?
two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

germany plays an important role in that respect , the country 's president told delegates on wednesday . speaking to about 450 pen delegates at the 72nd international pen congress , german president horst köhler on wednesday said that germany in particular had an obligation to do everything in its power to protect writers . " if germany is the nation of culture that it intends to be again , then we have to stand up and fight for freedom of language , art and culture , " köhler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiri grusa -lrb- right -rrb- and johano strasser freedom of expression is one of the main themes of this year 's congress , which returns to berlin for the first time in 80 years and comes two decades after the last meeting in germany , in hamburg .
protecting writers from persecution and safeguarding freedom of expression are pen 's main goals . " there are countries such as iran , turkey or cuba , where authors are jailed because of their books , " said jiri grusa , a czech writer and president of pen international , adding that 1,000 writers around the globe are under attack .
only last year , 37 died because of their work , and 200 writers are currently in jail . celebrating african literature " writing in a peaceless world " is the slogan of the week-long meeting .
while the organization , which was founded in london in 1921 and has more than 140 chapters worldwide , is not a political one , delegates will focus on topics such as persecution , oppressive media laws and fake libel suits . the african continent is the focus of this year 's meeting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass was scheduled to address delegates on wednesday " we only think about africa in case people get slaughtered or natural catastrophes occur , " said johano strasser , who heads the german chapter of pen , adding that the continent 's amazing literature scene is largely ignored . " we 're not just going to talk about problems , but celebrate a feast of literature , " strasser said , adding that nobel prize winners nadine gordimer and günter grass along with other writers such as magriet de moor , peter nadas , a.l. kennedy and per olov enquist are expected to attend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the pen to the pitch : world literature meets soccer the author crafting pitch-perfect prose and the soccer player setting up a picture-perfect goal might seem like diametric opposites .
but they have more in common than you 'd think , as a recent symposium in berlin showed .

11 attacks , german lawmakers had given considerably more powers to intelligence officers to obtain information , particularly about people with a muslim background .
the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .
they were approved by then interior minister otto schily , a social democrat .
he played no small role in making sure that this highly controversial means of preventive investigation made it into the second package of anti-terror legislation adopted after the terrorist attacks in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf announced its dissolution via fax in 1998 the searches rely on computerized profiling methods which were first used here in the 1970s to hunt down members of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
the tricky thing about the methods employed is that they completely fall short of data privacy considerations . usually , a profiling search compares data only from official bodies , such as the residents ' registration office or the social security and traffic departments .
but the expanded permission allowed access to data from sources that intelligence agents would n't normally get their hands on , such as health insurance companies , real estate agents or utility companies . a black day for combating terrorism ? on tuesday , germany 's highest court , the constitutional court , made it much harder for police or intelligence agencies to start such a search .
it ruled that a general threat situation like the one following sept .
11 does not justify any large-scale profiling activities if there 's no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of germany 's constitutional court judges also said that such profiling , if it became known publicly , could " reinforce prejudices and stigmatize the affected social groups in the perception of the public , " reuters reported . while police union officials said that the ruling made it virtually impossible to effectively deal with terrorist threats , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , described the ruling as " a black day for the effective combating of terrorist attacks . " ruling to affect world cup preparations karl-dieter möller , the legal affairs correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he believed the court ruling would have an impact on future intelligence activities during the soccer world cup , starting in germany in june . " this sort of profiling search will only be possible if regional police and interior ministers are able to prove that there 's concrete evidence that a terrorist attack is being planned , " he said .
" in other words , they 'd have to prove that such a threat exists for this or that day or week , or that a threat is unambiguously linked to a certain football fixture .
and we 're talking about hard evidence .
that is , a mere suspicion or probability that something might happen will no longer be sufficient to justify profiling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers wo n't only monitor games but also check potential world cup employees just one day before the court ruling , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence agency , had confirmed that about 220,000 people interested in world cup-related jobs are being screened with methods that at least come very close to profiling searches . " what i 've seen from the results so far does n't include any major surprises , " he said .
" there are a number - but few - cases where we 'll not allow employment contracts in stadiums or generally in the vicinity of world cup venues .
we may come up with a more detailed report of our search when it 's done . " legal overhaul required a revision of intelligence work and regional police laws will have to be carried out as a consequence of the karlsruhe ruling which does justice to a moroccan student who had complained to the court after becoming the victim of a profiling search in north rhine-westphalia . incidentally , the same federal state is reported to have profiled some 5 million people between 18 and 40 years of age since 2001 without any concrete evidence of a terror threat .

but the watchdog group 's german branch saw positive developments last year as well . in its annual report on the human rights situation in some 140 countries , amnesty international lambasted rich nations for focusing their efforts on security rather than fighting poverty .
it also noted growing proof of a secret prison partnership between the middle east and the west in the " war on terror . " the human rights watchdog condemned countries , including the us , china and russia , of diluting efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere , such as sudan 's darfur region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refugee who fled darfur , sudan , for chad " governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests , sacrificed principles in the name of the ' war on terror ' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights abuses , " amnesty 's secretary general irene khan said in a statement released with the report . secret prison partnership the report also said a growing body of evidence showed that there is a secret prison partnership between western and middle eastern countries in the " war on terror , " resulting in widespread human rights abuses .
and it blamed us-led and iraqi security forces for " grave human rights violations , " with thousands being held without charge or trial in us detention centers , such as guantanamo prison . meanwhile , barbara lochbihler , head of the german branch of amnesty international , ai deutschland , noted some positive tendencies in human rights compared with last year 's report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler , head of ai deutschland for instance , last year the us government passed a law forbidding torture by us civil servants , even abroad .
" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration . " imagine what an effect that has on the chinese people , on the human rights activists there , to know that human rights issues are a topic discussed at the highest levels … .
on top of that , it is important to take the chinese officials seriously who said they would really try to make headway on human rights ahead of the 2008 olympics in beijing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usbekistan 's interior minister almatov finally , ai deutschland severely criticized germany for failing to act in the case of uzbekistan 's interior minster zakir almatov .
at the end of last year , the country allowed almatov to stay in a german hospital for medical treatment .
torture is widespread in uzbekistan , and only two weeks ago was the first anniversary of the andishan massacre , which saw hundreds of demonstrators shot down in the streets by security forces . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia used front companies to transfer suspects , says amnesty the us central intelligence agency has used private aircraft firms and front companies secretly to transfer terror suspects in violation of international law , amnesty international charged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.05.2006 can the world cup withstand heated race debate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says neo-nazi protesters should n't abuse the world cup germany is working hard to prevent the far right from hijacking the soccer world cup and promote a positive image weeks before the event opens .
will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .
a documented increase of right-wing criminal activity does little to promote the world cup as " a time to make friends " , the tournament 's motto . interior minister wolfgang schäuble has pledged to keep neo-nazis from using the sporting spectacle as a stage to demonstrate . " we will do everything to make sure that the soccer world cup can not be abused by extremist organisations to spread their detestable ideas , " schäuble said .
" we will not tolerate any form of extremism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . " schäuble also stated his belief that there are no " no-go " areas in germany .
security forces around the country will make sure that is the case and that " everybody can feel safe in our country , " he said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : number of neo-nazis rises in germany a new report by germany 's domestic intelligence office says the number of neo-nazi activists in germany went up last year , while the number of right-wing extremists willing to use violence increased marginally .
-lrb- may 21 , 2006 -rrb- former government spokesman warns of racist hotspots world cup visitors who are n't white should steer clear of the state of brandenburg , a former government spokesman cautioned on wednesday .
his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .
-lrb- may 18 , 2006 -rrb- fifa boss accused of u-turn on world cup racism measures only a month after he launched a set of anti-racism measures , fifa president sepp blatter is under pressure from a eu lawmaker who accuses him of making a u-turn on his promises to kick racism out of the world cup .

after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .

" we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .

two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

but the watchdog group 's german branch saw positive developments last year as well . in its annual report on the human rights situation in some 140 countries , amnesty international lambasted rich nations for focusing their efforts on security rather than fighting poverty .
it also noted growing proof of a secret prison partnership between the middle east and the west in the " war on terror . " the human rights watchdog condemned countries , including the us , china and russia , of diluting efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere , such as sudan 's darfur region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refugee who fled darfur , sudan , for chad " governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests , sacrificed principles in the name of the ' war on terror ' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights abuses , " amnesty 's secretary general irene khan said in a statement released with the report . secret prison partnership the report also said a growing body of evidence showed that there is a secret prison partnership between western and middle eastern countries in the " war on terror , " resulting in widespread human rights abuses .
and it blamed us-led and iraqi security forces for " grave human rights violations , " with thousands being held without charge or trial in us detention centers , such as guantanamo prison . meanwhile , barbara lochbihler , head of the german branch of amnesty international , ai deutschland , noted some positive tendencies in human rights compared with last year 's report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler , head of ai deutschland for instance , last year the us government passed a law forbidding torture by us civil servants , even abroad .
" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration . " imagine what an effect that has on the chinese people , on the human rights activists there , to know that human rights issues are a topic discussed at the highest levels … .
on top of that , it is important to take the chinese officials seriously who said they would really try to make headway on human rights ahead of the 2008 olympics in beijing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usbekistan 's interior minister almatov finally , ai deutschland severely criticized germany for failing to act in the case of uzbekistan 's interior minster zakir almatov .
at the end of last year , the country allowed almatov to stay in a german hospital for medical treatment .
torture is widespread in uzbekistan , and only two weeks ago was the first anniversary of the andishan massacre , which saw hundreds of demonstrators shot down in the streets by security forces . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia used front companies to transfer suspects , says amnesty the us central intelligence agency has used private aircraft firms and front companies secretly to transfer terror suspects in violation of international law , amnesty international charged .

will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .
a documented increase of right-wing criminal activity does little to promote the world cup as " a time to make friends " , the tournament 's motto . interior minister wolfgang schäuble has pledged to keep neo-nazis from using the sporting spectacle as a stage to demonstrate . " we will do everything to make sure that the soccer world cup can not be abused by extremist organisations to spread their detestable ideas , " schäuble said .
" we will not tolerate any form of extremism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . " schäuble also stated his belief that there are no " no-go " areas in germany .
security forces around the country will make sure that is the case and that " everybody can feel safe in our country , " he said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : number of neo-nazis rises in germany a new report by germany 's domestic intelligence office says the number of neo-nazi activists in germany went up last year , while the number of right-wing extremists willing to use violence increased marginally .

but the watchdog group 's german branch saw positive developments last year as well . in its annual report on the human rights situation in some 140 countries , amnesty international lambasted rich nations for focusing their efforts on security rather than fighting poverty .
it also noted growing proof of a secret prison partnership between the middle east and the west in the " war on terror . " the human rights watchdog condemned countries , including the us , china and russia , of diluting efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere , such as sudan 's darfur region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refugee who fled darfur , sudan , for chad " governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests , sacrificed principles in the name of the ' war on terror ' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights abuses , " amnesty 's secretary general irene khan said in a statement released with the report . secret prison partnership the report also said a growing body of evidence showed that there is a secret prison partnership between western and middle eastern countries in the " war on terror , " resulting in widespread human rights abuses .
and it blamed us-led and iraqi security forces for " grave human rights violations , " with thousands being held without charge or trial in us detention centers , such as guantanamo prison . meanwhile , barbara lochbihler , head of the german branch of amnesty international , ai deutschland , noted some positive tendencies in human rights compared with last year 's report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler , head of ai deutschland for instance , last year the us government passed a law forbidding torture by us civil servants , even abroad .
" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration . " imagine what an effect that has on the chinese people , on the human rights activists there , to know that human rights issues are a topic discussed at the highest levels … .
on top of that , it is important to take the chinese officials seriously who said they would really try to make headway on human rights ahead of the 2008 olympics in beijing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usbekistan 's interior minister almatov finally , ai deutschland severely criticized germany for failing to act in the case of uzbekistan 's interior minster zakir almatov .
at the end of last year , the country allowed almatov to stay in a german hospital for medical treatment .
torture is widespread in uzbekistan , and only two weeks ago was the first anniversary of the andishan massacre , which saw hundreds of demonstrators shot down in the streets by security forces . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia used front companies to transfer suspects , says amnesty the us central intelligence agency has used private aircraft firms and front companies secretly to transfer terror suspects in violation of international law , amnesty international charged .

jin reportedly said that the roman catholic church led by the vatican has not officially recognized him as a bishop , but tolerates him . one day after merkel said she had pressed chinese premier wen jiabao on religious freedoms and human rights , the 90-year-old jin recounted his lengthy stints in chinese jails and forced re-education camps .

shortly after deutsche börse revealed the financial terms of its merger offer , euronext curtly dismissed the deal . " this is the same offer that we received over the weekend and which was fully considered by the board yesterday , " euronext finance chief serge harry said . euronext 's supervisory board said on monday that the nyse 's bid was more attractive than frankfurt 's . the german bid is a combination of shares plus two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in cash , with analysts estimating the total value of the deal at 8.6 billion euros . for its part , the nyse has laid $ 10.2 billion on the table for euronext , also in a mix of cash and shares . euronext shareholders will now meet in amsterdam on tuesday to discuss a potential merger or takeover . should euronext and nyse come together , they would form the world 's largest stock exchange that 's three times bigger than its closest competitor .

" frankfurt should have started talking to new york much earlier . " fra n co-germa n rivalries while euronext is n't a french company , it is currently led from paris .
that 's why the german merger plans have been eyed with suspicion .

but the watchdog group 's german branch saw positive developments last year as well . in its annual report on the human rights situation in some 140 countries , amnesty international lambasted rich nations for focusing their efforts on security rather than fighting poverty .
it also noted growing proof of a secret prison partnership between the middle east and the west in the " war on terror . " the human rights watchdog condemned countries , including the us , china and russia , of diluting efforts to solve conflicts elsewhere , such as sudan 's darfur region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a refugee who fled darfur , sudan , for chad " governments collectively and individually paralyzed international institutions and squandered public resources in pursuit of narrow security interests , sacrificed principles in the name of the ' war on terror ' and turned a blind eye to massive human rights abuses , " amnesty 's secretary general irene khan said in a statement released with the report . secret prison partnership the report also said a growing body of evidence showed that there is a secret prison partnership between western and middle eastern countries in the " war on terror , " resulting in widespread human rights abuses .
and it blamed us-led and iraqi security forces for " grave human rights violations , " with thousands being held without charge or trial in us detention centers , such as guantanamo prison . meanwhile , barbara lochbihler , head of the german branch of amnesty international , ai deutschland , noted some positive tendencies in human rights compared with last year 's report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara lochbihler , head of ai deutschland for instance , last year the us government passed a law forbidding torture by us civil servants , even abroad .
" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration . " imagine what an effect that has on the chinese people , on the human rights activists there , to know that human rights issues are a topic discussed at the highest levels … .
on top of that , it is important to take the chinese officials seriously who said they would really try to make headway on human rights ahead of the 2008 olympics in beijing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usbekistan 's interior minister almatov finally , ai deutschland severely criticized germany for failing to act in the case of uzbekistan 's interior minster zakir almatov .

" there was incredible internal resistance , and we see it as a positive change in trend , " lochbihler said . also , the outcry against human rights abuses at guantanamo prison is spreading , she said .
" we see that now , other organizations … have demanded the closure of guantanamo prison .
compared with before , we are no longer the only ones who are demanding that human rights not be compromised through the fight against terror . " at the same time , ai deutschland criticized the " war on terror " as the source of massive human-rights infractions , especially regarding the transport of prisoners through european airspace by secret service agencies .
the organization has demanded explanations from european governments . uk-mideast deals draw fire moreover , in the name of the terror fight , european nations are trying to override previously secured human-rights standards , lochbihler said .
she gave the example of britain making diplomatic deals to export terror suspects to egypt , lebanon and jordan , with the explicit statement that the countries will not practice torture , yet knowing that torture practices are common there . " that is a change for the worse . … europe has really got to be especially attentive to this case , " lochbihler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel toasted with chinese head of state wen jiabao on her visit on the positive side , " more and more government figures who have abused human rights or been accused of war crimes , have been taken to court , " she said , naming liberia 's charles taylor as a particular example . kudos for angie angela merkel 's visit to china , where she refused to sweep the human rights question under the rug , also gave activists cause for celebration . " imagine what an effect that has on the chinese people , on the human rights activists there , to know that human rights issues are a topic discussed at the highest levels … .
on top of that , it is important to take the chinese officials seriously who said they would really try to make headway on human rights ahead of the 2008 olympics in beijing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : usbekistan 's interior minister almatov finally , ai deutschland severely criticized germany for failing to act in the case of uzbekistan 's interior minster zakir almatov .
at the end of last year , the country allowed almatov to stay in a german hospital for medical treatment .

11 attacks , german lawmakers had given considerably more powers to intelligence officers to obtain information , particularly about people with a muslim background .
the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .
they were approved by then interior minister otto schily , a social democrat .
he played no small role in making sure that this highly controversial means of preventive investigation made it into the second package of anti-terror legislation adopted after the terrorist attacks in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf announced its dissolution via fax in 1998 the searches rely on computerized profiling methods which were first used here in the 1970s to hunt down members of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
the tricky thing about the methods employed is that they completely fall short of data privacy considerations . usually , a profiling search compares data only from official bodies , such as the residents ' registration office or the social security and traffic departments .
but the expanded permission allowed access to data from sources that intelligence agents would n't normally get their hands on , such as health insurance companies , real estate agents or utility companies . a black day for combating terrorism ? on tuesday , germany 's highest court , the constitutional court , made it much harder for police or intelligence agencies to start such a search .
it ruled that a general threat situation like the one following sept .
11 does not justify any large-scale profiling activities if there 's no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of germany 's constitutional court judges also said that such profiling , if it became known publicly , could " reinforce prejudices and stigmatize the affected social groups in the perception of the public , " reuters reported . while police union officials said that the ruling made it virtually impossible to effectively deal with terrorist threats , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , described the ruling as " a black day for the effective combating of terrorist attacks . " ruling to affect world cup preparations karl-dieter möller , the legal affairs correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he believed the court ruling would have an impact on future intelligence activities during the soccer world cup , starting in germany in june . " this sort of profiling search will only be possible if regional police and interior ministers are able to prove that there 's concrete evidence that a terrorist attack is being planned , " he said .
" in other words , they 'd have to prove that such a threat exists for this or that day or week , or that a threat is unambiguously linked to a certain football fixture .
and we 're talking about hard evidence .
that is , a mere suspicion or probability that something might happen will no longer be sufficient to justify profiling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers wo n't only monitor games but also check potential world cup employees just one day before the court ruling , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence agency , had confirmed that about 220,000 people interested in world cup-related jobs are being screened with methods that at least come very close to profiling searches . " what i 've seen from the results so far does n't include any major surprises , " he said .
" there are a number - but few - cases where we 'll not allow employment contracts in stadiums or generally in the vicinity of world cup venues .
we may come up with a more detailed report of our search when it 's done . " legal overhaul required a revision of intelligence work and regional police laws will have to be carried out as a consequence of the karlsruhe ruling which does justice to a moroccan student who had complained to the court after becoming the victim of a profiling search in north rhine-westphalia . incidentally , the same federal state is reported to have profiled some 5 million people between 18 and 40 years of age since 2001 without any concrete evidence of a terror threat .

after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .

two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

11 attacks , german lawmakers had given considerably more powers to intelligence officers to obtain information , particularly about people with a muslim background .
the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .
they were approved by then interior minister otto schily , a social democrat .
he played no small role in making sure that this highly controversial means of preventive investigation made it into the second package of anti-terror legislation adopted after the terrorist attacks in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf announced its dissolution via fax in 1998 the searches rely on computerized profiling methods which were first used here in the 1970s to hunt down members of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
the tricky thing about the methods employed is that they completely fall short of data privacy considerations . usually , a profiling search compares data only from official bodies , such as the residents ' registration office or the social security and traffic departments .
but the expanded permission allowed access to data from sources that intelligence agents would n't normally get their hands on , such as health insurance companies , real estate agents or utility companies . a black day for combating terrorism ? on tuesday , germany 's highest court , the constitutional court , made it much harder for police or intelligence agencies to start such a search .
it ruled that a general threat situation like the one following sept .
11 does not justify any large-scale profiling activities if there 's no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of germany 's constitutional court judges also said that such profiling , if it became known publicly , could " reinforce prejudices and stigmatize the affected social groups in the perception of the public , " reuters reported . while police union officials said that the ruling made it virtually impossible to effectively deal with terrorist threats , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , described the ruling as " a black day for the effective combating of terrorist attacks . " ruling to affect world cup preparations karl-dieter möller , the legal affairs correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he believed the court ruling would have an impact on future intelligence activities during the soccer world cup , starting in germany in june . " this sort of profiling search will only be possible if regional police and interior ministers are able to prove that there 's concrete evidence that a terrorist attack is being planned , " he said .
" in other words , they 'd have to prove that such a threat exists for this or that day or week , or that a threat is unambiguously linked to a certain football fixture .
and we 're talking about hard evidence .
that is , a mere suspicion or probability that something might happen will no longer be sufficient to justify profiling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers wo n't only monitor games but also check potential world cup employees just one day before the court ruling , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence agency , had confirmed that about 220,000 people interested in world cup-related jobs are being screened with methods that at least come very close to profiling searches . " what i 've seen from the results so far does n't include any major surprises , " he said .
" there are a number - but few - cases where we 'll not allow employment contracts in stadiums or generally in the vicinity of world cup venues .
we may come up with a more detailed report of our search when it 's done . " legal overhaul required a revision of intelligence work and regional police laws will have to be carried out as a consequence of the karlsruhe ruling which does justice to a moroccan student who had complained to the court after becoming the victim of a profiling search in north rhine-westphalia . incidentally , the same federal state is reported to have profiled some 5 million people between 18 and 40 years of age since 2001 without any concrete evidence of a terror threat .
not a single so-called sleeper has been found . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .

the latter 's supervisory board has already backed the deal , saying that it was more " attractive " than a counter-offer by german stock exchange deutsche börse . deutsche börse meanwhile suffered a new blow tuesday in its long-running attempt to woo euronext , when the pan-european stock market operator publicly snubbed its renewed advances in favor of a tie-up with the new york stock exchange .
shortly after deutsche börse revealed the financial terms of its merger offer , euronext curtly dismissed the deal . " this is the same offer that we received over the weekend and which was fully considered by the board yesterday , " euronext finance chief serge harry said . euronext 's supervisory board said on monday that the nyse 's bid was more attractive than frankfurt 's . the german bid is a combination of shares plus two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- in cash , with analysts estimating the total value of the deal at 8.6 billion euros . for its part , the nyse has laid $ 10.2 billion on the table for euronext , also in a mix of cash and shares . euronext shareholders will now meet in amsterdam on tuesday to discuss a potential merger or takeover . should euronext and nyse come together , they would form the world 's largest stock exchange that 's three times bigger than its closest competitor .

the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .
they were approved by then interior minister otto schily , a social democrat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2006 wild bear leaves bavaria after officials order him killed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bear has left a few traces , such as these hairs caught on barbed wire a wild brown bear has been sighted in germany for the first time in over 170 years .
after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .
but this guy is different , and it makes life dangerous close to him . " searchi n g for alter n atives there is still a chance that the bear might be discovered and caught alive by animal welfare agencies , but finding a home could prove difficult .
officials at the munich zoo have said they wo n't put a wild bear in a cage because it wo n't get along with its tamer brown bears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bear - which looks similar to this one - survive his bavarian outing ?
two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .
but this guy is different , and it makes life dangerous close to him . " searchi n g for alter n atives there is still a chance that the bear might be discovered and caught alive by animal welfare agencies , but finding a home could prove difficult .
officials at the munich zoo have said they wo n't put a wild bear in a cage because it wo n't get along with its tamer brown bears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bear - which looks similar to this one - survive his bavarian outing ?
two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

11 attacks , german lawmakers had given considerably more powers to intelligence officers to obtain information , particularly about people with a muslim background .
the were also allowed to employ a nationwide profiling search to flush out so-called sleepers , such as the sept .
11 attackers , who had lived in hamburg for years without raising suspicion . the profiling searches in germany have primarily targeted arab students .
they were approved by then interior minister otto schily , a social democrat .
he played no small role in making sure that this highly controversial means of preventive investigation made it into the second package of anti-terror legislation adopted after the terrorist attacks in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf announced its dissolution via fax in 1998 the searches rely on computerized profiling methods which were first used here in the 1970s to hunt down members of the radical red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- .
the tricky thing about the methods employed is that they completely fall short of data privacy considerations . usually , a profiling search compares data only from official bodies , such as the residents ' registration office or the social security and traffic departments .
but the expanded permission allowed access to data from sources that intelligence agents would n't normally get their hands on , such as health insurance companies , real estate agents or utility companies . a black day for combating terrorism ? on tuesday , germany 's highest court , the constitutional court , made it much harder for police or intelligence agencies to start such a search .
it ruled that a general threat situation like the one following sept .
11 does not justify any large-scale profiling activities if there 's no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of germany 's constitutional court judges also said that such profiling , if it became known publicly , could " reinforce prejudices and stigmatize the affected social groups in the perception of the public , " reuters reported . while police union officials said that the ruling made it virtually impossible to effectively deal with terrorist threats , bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , a member of the conservative christian social union , described the ruling as " a black day for the effective combating of terrorist attacks . " ruling to affect world cup preparations karl-dieter möller , the legal affairs correspondent for german public broadcaster ard , said he believed the court ruling would have an impact on future intelligence activities during the soccer world cup , starting in germany in june . " this sort of profiling search will only be possible if regional police and interior ministers are able to prove that there 's concrete evidence that a terrorist attack is being planned , " he said .
" in other words , they 'd have to prove that such a threat exists for this or that day or week , or that a threat is unambiguously linked to a certain football fixture .
and we 're talking about hard evidence .
that is , a mere suspicion or probability that something might happen will no longer be sufficient to justify profiling . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers wo n't only monitor games but also check potential world cup employees just one day before the court ruling , heinz fromm , the president of germany 's domestic intelligence agency , had confirmed that about 220,000 people interested in world cup-related jobs are being screened with methods that at least come very close to profiling searches .

after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .
it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .
but this guy is different , and it makes life dangerous close to him . " searchi n g for alter n atives there is still a chance that the bear might be discovered and caught alive by animal welfare agencies , but finding a home could prove difficult .
officials at the munich zoo have said they wo n't put a wild bear in a cage because it wo n't get along with its tamer brown bears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bear - which looks similar to this one - survive his bavarian outing ?
two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .

last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .
a documented increase of right-wing criminal activity does little to promote the world cup as " a time to make friends " , the tournament 's motto . interior minister wolfgang schäuble has pledged to keep neo-nazis from using the sporting spectacle as a stage to demonstrate . " we will do everything to make sure that the soccer world cup can not be abused by extremist organisations to spread their detestable ideas , " schäuble said .
" we will not tolerate any form of extremism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . " schäuble also stated his belief that there are no " no-go " areas in germany .
security forces around the country will make sure that is the case and that " everybody can feel safe in our country , " he said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : number of neo-nazis rises in germany a new report by germany 's domestic intelligence office says the number of neo-nazi activists in germany went up last year , while the number of right-wing extremists willing to use violence increased marginally .

his warning caused a storm of outrage - as well as agreement - from politicians .

it feasted on farm animals and raided honey farms .
bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .
this bear has become a problem .
he seems to be out of control and we can not take the risk of people being hurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this farmer 's sheep were killed by the bear while some animal lovers were outraged over the shoot-to-kill order , animal welfare agencies agreed that the bear had to be stopped as quickly as possible , said roland melisch from the world wildlife fund in germany . " we all welcome this bear coming in from tirol , but what can we do ? " asked melisch .
" there is no way to risk one human life for such a creature , and this bear appears to be a young bear , a sub-adult , which is looking for food .
usually they are very aware of humans and try not to encounter humans , they are shy .
but this guy is different , and it makes life dangerous close to him . " searchi n g for alter n atives there is still a chance that the bear might be discovered and caught alive by animal welfare agencies , but finding a home could prove difficult .
officials at the munich zoo have said they wo n't put a wild bear in a cage because it wo n't get along with its tamer brown bears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the bear - which looks similar to this one - survive his bavarian outing ?
two animal protection groups , however , have offered to house the bear in a three-hectar -lrb- 7.4-acre -rrb- enclosure to prevent the animal from being shot . all the hype and screaming headlines in german tabloids must have convinced the young brown bear that germany 's not such a welcoming place to roam after all .
on tuesday afternoon , bavarian officials said that he has probably left the country and returned to austria . " we do n't think he 's in bavaria anymore , " said one official , adding that the search for the bear had been halted .
still , it appears that the bear 's ploy to stay alive might not work out : austrian authorities have also called for the bear to be shot upon sight - but only from authorized hunters . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fur makes a comeback in germany fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .

the tricky thing about the methods employed is that they completely fall short of data privacy considerations . usually , a profiling search compares data only from official bodies , such as the residents ' registration office or the social security and traffic departments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.05.2006 can the world cup withstand heated race debate ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says neo-nazi protesters should n't abuse the world cup germany is working hard to prevent the far right from hijacking the soccer world cup and promote a positive image weeks before the event opens .
will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .
a documented increase of right-wing criminal activity does little to promote the world cup as " a time to make friends " , the tournament 's motto . interior minister wolfgang schäuble has pledged to keep neo-nazis from using the sporting spectacle as a stage to demonstrate . " we will do everything to make sure that the soccer world cup can not be abused by extremist organisations to spread their detestable ideas , " schäuble said .
" we will not tolerate any form of extremism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . " schäuble also stated his belief that there are no " no-go " areas in germany .
security forces around the country will make sure that is the case and that " everybody can feel safe in our country , " he said . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : number of neo-nazis rises in germany a new report by germany 's domestic intelligence office says the number of neo-nazi activists in germany went up last year , while the number of right-wing extremists willing to use violence increased marginally .

will ongoing controversy over racism get in the way ? former german government spokesman uwe-karsten heye got the ball rolling .
last week , the one-time close aide of gerhard schröder said in a newspaper interview that he would tell world cup visitors that there were certain " no-go " areas in the eastern german state of brandenburg and elsewhere where he " would not advise anyone with a different skin color to go .
they might not possibly leave alive . " heye 's comments unleashed a heated debate over whether such statements are useful and appropriate . nearly every public figure seems determined to have a say , and many found heye out of place .
on the other hand , human rights group amnesty international backed him up , saying he put the spotlight on " a serious problem . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five turks in solingen died in this fire set by neo-nazis in 1993 but with the world cup literally days away , the roiling racism discussion has begun to bump up against germany 's concerted effort to present itself in the best light to the millions of soccer fans from around the globe who will watch or attend the games . germany sees the world cup as an opportunity to make a good impression - the country 's notorious past is pointedly not part of that picture . but should such a timely topic be swept under the rug for the duration of the event ?
what should take priority , the country 's image or individual safety ? less than sparkling image among german immigrants memet kilic came to germany from turkey a year after the berlin wall fell in 1989 .
as chairman of the federal foreigners ' advisory board , he sees parallels between that time and the current situation . " the nationalistic feelings are the same then as now .
the attacks on people with different skin color are rising just like after 1990 .
heye is right about the ' no-go ' zones .
it 's a big problem , " said kilic , now a lawyer in heidelberg . the worries about a tarnished image abroad concern kilic less than the damage already done in immigrants ' eyes in germany .
he is incensed that some politicians , such as bavarian premier edmund stoiber , place all the blame for integration problems on foreigners . " i am very angry that stoiber says things like ' i am going to save german society , " ' kilic said . he reckons that during the month-long finals , the police will group right-wing extremists with hooligans , detaining them if necessary so that the world cup does not suffer any embarrassing incidents . the " xenophobic " image is perpetuated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremists want to demonstrate when angola plays in leipzig the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg are most often in the news when it comes to reports of racial attacks and xenophobia .
on june 21 , angola faces iran in a world cup group match in the saxon city of leipzig .
neo-nazis apparently want to march there on that day .
their plan is to show support for iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and his anti-semitic rhetoric , including a denial of the holocaust . saxony 's commissioner for the affairs of foreigners , friederike de haas , said she hopes the demonstration wo n't take place .
such a march would only backfire publicly in the glare of the world cup , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uwe-karsten heye warned that foreigners face grave dangers in some regions heye 's coment about " no-go " areas and possible hazards to foreigners during the world cup should be taken seriously , de haas said .
but , she said , it should not only be so in june and july . interior minister drops the gauntlet a report out from the country 's office for the protection of the constitution on monday said the number of members of neo-nazi groups had risen from 3,800 to 4,100 last year , while right-wing extremists identified as being willing to resort to physical violence had increased slightly from 10,000 to 10,400 . from the standpoint of world cup organizers , the timing of the report - less than three weeks away from the opening whistle - was not ideal .
a documented increase of right-wing criminal activity does little to promote the world cup as " a time to make friends " , the tournament 's motto . interior minister wolfgang schäuble has pledged to keep neo-nazis from using the sporting spectacle as a stage to demonstrate . " we will do everything to make sure that the soccer world cup can not be abused by extremist organisations to spread their detestable ideas , " schäuble said .
" we will not tolerate any form of extremism , xenophobia and anti-semitism . " schäuble also stated his belief that there are no " no-go " areas in germany .

after it killed other animals , officials have approved shooting the bear , but now it looks as if he 's chosen to leave voluntarily . after crossing the border from austria over the weekend , the animal had been steadily moving through the southern state of bavaria .

bavarian government officials , who first welcomed the bear , then feared for the safety of humans and have the go-ahead for the bear to be shot and killed . " licensed hunters have a clear order to shoot the bear , " said bavarian environment minister werner schnappauf .
" it has gotten used to looking for food in residential areas .

the survey by an anti-piracy lobby group shows the percentage of illegal software in use in the uk has stayed at 27 % for the last two years .
the business software alliance said the piracy cost the uk 's technology sector almost £ 1bn a year .
it called on the government to help tackle the " hardcore " of pirates who continue to use counterfeit software .
rate change the uk figure of 27 % is below the global average of 35 % of pirated software .
but siobhan carroll , the bsa 's regional manager for northern europe , said it showed that some british businesses had a complacent attitude toward the use of illegal software .
by comparison , piracy rates in the us stand at 21 % .
piracy figures are calculated by working out how much pc software was installed in 2005 and subtracting from that the amount paid for software during the year .
top three software pirates vietnam : 90 % zimbabwe : 90 % indonesia : 87 % she said it was disappointing that uk piracy rates for pc software had remained static and called on the government to do more to educate businesses about the issue .
there was only so much the bsa could do to make sure businesses bought and licensed all the software they used , said ms carroll .
the impact of pirated software was felt very widely , she said , as it took cash out of the uk 's technology culture and stunted money available for innovation .
" this is a serious issue .
it 's not affecting just businesses but everyone down the line , " she said .
she added that reducing piracy significantly would mean a boost for the uk economy .
bottom three software pirates united states : 21 % new zealand : 23 % austria : 26 % there was increasing evidence , said ms carroll , that organised crime groups were behind many sophisticated counterfeiting efforts and profiting from the continued use of illegal software .
the bsa survey , carried out for the anti-piracy group by analyst firm idc , shows that piracy in some nations is still rampant .
in vietnam , piracy rates stand at 90 % , the highest in the world .
in some countries where piracy rates have been notoriously high , such as china , official efforts to tackle the problem are having an effect .
piracy rates in china have dropped by 4 percentage points to about 85 % .

research by bbc wales ' week in week out programme found emissions rose by 0.2 % since 1990 , despite assembly government targets to reduce climate damage .
carbon emissions have been cut in england , scotland and northern ireland .
first minister rhodri morgan said wales ' " booming economy " had increased pollution as transport was necessary for people to get to work .
paul allen , from the centre for alternative technology in machynlleth , said the assembly government needed be " banging people 's heads together " on climate change .
" what i feel is needed is an integrated strategy looking at what action can be done by local authorities , national government and by individuals , " he said .
he blamed the rise in welsh emissions on the fact it was a largely rural area , which meant a higher dependence on private transport .
mr allen said improving public transport should be a priority , along with a " revitalisation of local markets " which would mean less goods brought needlessly into the country .
weather forecast for 2055 wales will be two degrees warmer sea levels from pembrokeshire to chepstow could be half a metre higher summer in south east wales could be up to three degrees warmer a third less summer rainfall from bangor to bridgend snowfall half of what it is now from snowdonia to the brecon beacons more days of heavy rain and flood-risk , especially in north wales and ceredigion source : climate forecast model for bbc wales ' week in week out " wales imports hundreds of thousands of lambs from europe - why do this when we have our own lambs ? " he said .
" we 're not critical of the assembly government because they are doing a lot of good things - but the key thing is to join together all the initiatives they are running into one strategy . "
since devolution , responsibility for cutting greenhouse gases has rested with the assembly government .
the figures , from the national atmospheric emissions inventory -lrb- naei -rrb- , are a comparison of emissions between 1990 and 2003 - the latest year statistics have been collated .
the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in wales is the energy industry .
according to the naei figures , emissions from electricity generation in wales have increased by 22 % - compared with a fall of 15 % in the uk as a whole .
energy efficient britain is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the kyoto agreement .
scientists have predicted the earth will warm by 1.4 - 5.8c by 2100 .
many experts blame the rise on increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
mr morgan told bbc wales it was vital for the welsh economy to get more people to work , but said this had an impact on carbon dioxide levels .
he added : " if we do n't have a strong economy you ca n't afford the capital expenditure to make our schools , our social housing , our private housing and our hospital estate much more energy efficient in the future .
" that 's what we 've got to do and you have to pay for that - you have to put your capital in up front to make these buildings much more energy efficient . "
the programme also forecasts what the weather could be like in 2025 , 2055 and 2085 , based on climate change .
it projects drier summers and sea level rises , based on a projected rise in temperatures of three degrees by 2085 .

the rspb said the three chicks were being sheltered from the rain by their mother in their nest in the glaslyn valley , gwynedd .

barratt plans more than 200 one-bedroom flats , costing around £ 80,000 each , as part of the new morfa village near the liberty stadium .
it will see 564 properties built on the old addis factory site .
meanwhile 120 homes - many aimed at first-time buyers - are planned for the site of the old vetch football ground .
the addis site was bought by property development company pmg estates in 2004 with addis due to move to a new base in bridgend .
a planning application has been submitted for a mix of waterside apartments and town houses on land overlooking the river tawe .
it 's aimed at occupiers - people who can buy and get themselves on the property ladder in a very nice setting mike hall , pmg estates andrew crosby of barratt said the so-called i-pads were 381 sq ft starter homes , which would be the company 's first in wales .
" the i-pad forms an integral part of the scheme because we are introducing over 200 low-cost first-time buyer starter-units , " he said .
they have a living room with breakfast bar , one bedroom , one bathroom plus a balcony .
he said they had been designed following a challenge to the building industry from deputy prime minister john prescott for affordable housing on brown field sites .
buy-to-let " if we did not think the demand was there we would not be investing over £ 65m in the scheme , " he said .
according to property group rightmove.co.uk the average house price in wales now stands at £ 171,159 .
more than 1,000 homes are already being built at the city 's sa1 development in the maritime quarter .
pmg partner mike hall said : " in swansea there is a huge housing stock but its very difficult for first-time buyers to get on the market .
vetch plan 120 new homes emphasis on two and three storey houses sunken garden in centre of old football pitch 10mph speed limit to create safe streets " i think the sa1 scheme has very much become a buy-to-let and investors ' haven which this is not .
" it 's aimed at occupiers - people who can buy and get themselves on the property ladder in a very nice setting . "
meanwhile , a two-week exhibition opened on monday at county hall where draft plans for the council-owned vetch went on show .
the ground has not been used since the swans moved to the liberty stadium a year ago .
it includes a garden in the centre of the old football pitch .
cabinet member gareth sullivan said : " the plan is designed to reinvigorate the community by providing quality and affordable housing , open spaces , play areas and community facilities . "

the music group posted a 13 % rise in pre-tax profits to £ 159.3m for the year to 31 march from £ 141.1m in 2005 .
digital music sales experienced the strongest growth , more than doubling to £ 112.1m from £ 46.9m last year .
strong sales of coldplay 's x & y album also gave the group a lift - the global bestseller of 2005 was also the biggest selling digital release in the us .
" emi music has significantly outperformed the industry , gaining market share in almost all territories including the us , " emi chairman eric nicoli said .
the group said improved digital sales - which have more than doubled industry-wide in the past year - had helped offset a fall in cd sales .
artist appeal emi added its recorded music sales had " significantly outperformed " the global industry , partly as a result of the wide-ranging appeal of its artist roster .
in the past year , the group has released albums from artists as diverse as the rolling stones , gorrillaz , keith urban and breaking acts corinne bailey rae and kt tunstall .
the results come just weeks after emi 's latest attempt to secure a takeover of rival warner music failed .
warner music , whose artists include madonna , rejected a $ 4.2bn -lrb- £ 2.2bn ; 3.3bn euros -rrb- bid on 3 may .

they are worried about safety after asbestos was removed from the site .
managers have said there is no risk .
up to 250 people who walked out almost two weeks ago say they have been sacked but this has not been confirmed .
south hook lng said safety was being closely monitored and that the " vast majority " of workers remained at work .
the new lng terminal is being built on the site of the former esso refinery and will house gas shipped from the far east .
the gas , which will have been cooled down to liquid form for easy transportation , will then be turned back into natural gas before it is piped into the uk gas supply .
the company said on 11 may that " small quantities " of asbestos cement pipe had been found last year in the concrete foundations .
why did n't they tell us when it was going to take place and give us an opportunity to inspect the plans ?
shop steward douglas corbett work started last week to remove a plan for its disposal was developed along with the environment agency and other statutory bodies .
the contractors who walked out earlier in the month and who now claim they have been sacked , are mainly welders , steel erectors and labourers .
they had wanted the company to " damp down " asbestos during the day and showering facilities installed so workers did not go home " possibly covered in asbestos dust " .
welder and union shop steward douglas corbett , said the asbestos removal had been a " clandestine operation " .
" what we want are our jobs back and we are quite willing to return to work and discuss any other problems concerning this issue when we get back to work . "
the company has refused to confirm whether any worker has been sacked but said those who did " did not respond positively " to a call to return to work as normal on 22 may " may be in breach of their terms of employment " .
it has also said independent monitoring of the air quality confirmed the material was being handled " safely and effectively " .

pre-tax profits for the year to 1 april jumped 47 % to £ 745.7m -lrb- $ 1.41bn -rrb- from £ 505.1m at the same time last year .
however , chief executive stuart rose played down the rise , saying there was still " much to do " to ensure long-term growth at the group .
m & s has been improving its clothing range and cutting costs as it battles a tough trading environment .
however , across-the-year clothing sales remained flat , as a drop in sales in the first six months of the year offset a strong performance in the second half .
food focus but food sales grew , with revenues up 7 % overall and 3.6 % on a like-for-like basis - which offsets the impact of new stores . "
what they -lsb- customers -rsb- wanted from us was better values , whether it was from knickers right the way through to knitwear " stuart rose , m & s the company opened a number of simply food outlets over the past year and has also been trying out a new hot food to go take-away style format .
m & s has been concentrating on its food and womenswear offerings , in an effort to rebuild confidence in the brand .
as well as investing in store improvements , an award-winning advertising campaign featuring 1960s icon twiggy has helped improve its image .
as a result , the number of people visiting its shops has risen by 350,000 a week to more than 15 million a week - and more of these shoppers are now spending in store .
' respectable performance ' mr rose said the group 's strategy of " listening to customers " had paid dividends .
" what they wanted from us was better values , whether it was from knickers right the way through to knitwear or indeed sausages or sandwiches , they want us to deliver fantastic products and fantastic value , and value for us is a function of price time quality , " he told the bbc .
but he was unwilling to shout about the improvement - choosing instead to dub it a " respectable performance " .
" we need to drive sales , grow market share , improve the performance from our existing stores and continue to buy better , " mr rose said .
judi bevan , author of marks & spencer : what went wrong , said she believed the recovery at the company could be sustainable - providing mr rose remains at the helm .
right track ?
she added that mr rose had made a real difference after being brought into the group two years ago , as he had a good understanding of m & s customers and products .
" he 's got the product right , got the pricing right and the advertising has brought people in , " ms bevan said .
but richard hunter , head of uk equities at hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers , was more cautious .

pre-tax profits for the year to 1 april jumped 47 % to £ 745.7m -lrb- $ 1.41bn -rrb- from £ 505.1m at the same time last year .
however , chief executive stuart rose played down the rise , saying there was still " much to do " to ensure long-term growth at the group .
m & s has been improving its clothing range and cutting costs as it battles a tough trading environment .
however , across-the-year clothing sales remained flat , as a drop in sales in the first six months of the year offset a strong performance in the second half .
food focus but food sales grew , with revenues up 7 % overall and 3.6 % on a like-for-like basis - which offsets the impact of new stores .
what they -lsb- customers -rsb- wanted from us was better values , whether it was from knickers right the way through to knitwear stuart rose , m & s check the m & s share price the company opened a number of simply food outlets over the past year and has also been trying out a new hot food to go take-away style format .
m & s has been concentrating on its food and womenswear offerings , in an effort to rebuild confidence in the brand .
as well as investing in store improvements , an award-winning advertising campaign featuring 1960s icon twiggy has helped improve its image .
as a result , the number of people visiting its shops has risen by 350,000 a week to more than 15 million a week - and more of these shoppers are now spending in store .
' respectable performance ' mr rose said the group 's strategy of " listening to customers " had paid dividends .
mr rose is n't ready to toast the turnaround with champagne just yet " what they wanted from us was better values , whether it was from knickers right the way through to knitwear or indeed sausages or sandwiches , they want us to deliver fantastic products and fantastic value , and value for us is a function of price time quality , " he told the bbc .
but he was unwilling to shout about the improvement - choosing instead to dub it a " respectable performance " .
" we need to drive sales , grow market share , improve the performance from our existing stores and continue to buy better , " mr rose said .
judi bevan , author of marks & spencer : what went wrong , said she believed the recovery at the company could be sustainable - providing mr rose remains at the helm .
right track ?
she added that mr rose had made a real difference after being brought into the group two years ago , as he had a good understanding of m & s customers and products .
" he 's got the product right , got the pricing right and the advertising has brought people in , " ms bevan said .
but richard hunter , head of uk equities at hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers , was more cautious .
while he welcomed the continuing strength in sales , it warned shareholders against raising their expectations too high and risking a drop in m & s shares , which have risen 22 % in the last six months alone .

the move was taken by 10 zanzibaris who are seeking to invalidate the union of mainland tanzania and the archipelago .
as the court set 28 june to start hearings , top officials from zanzibar and the mainland met in dar-es-salaam .
they were discussing islanders ' claims of alleged injustices in the union treaty that led to the legal action .
" i believe that many problems facing the union can be solved and the best way is to discuss them transparently , " said federal vice-president ali mohammed shein , as talks began between union prime minister edward lowassa and zanzibar 's chief minister shamsi vuai nahodha .
correspondents say many zanzibaris feel that the union favours the mainland .
recent elections on zanzibar have seen violent clashes between supporters of the civic united front , which gets most of its support from the archipelago and the ruling ccm party .
zanzibar , with its long beaches and colourful history of trading spices and slaves , is one of tanzania 's main tourist attractions .

some of the staff in the bars and restaurants have already started putting up decorations to bring a bit of seasonal cheer into the place .
but that wo n't do .
officials have sent out a memo demanding that such jollity must not start until next week .
so there we have it , christmas officially starts on monday 5 december - and not a day earlier , right ! 1530 gmt , monday 23 january disgraced lib dem mp mark oaten is , at the time of writing , joint editor of the commons in-house publication , the house magazine .
and he was independent enough to allow himself to be pictured inside the latest edition under the heading " bad week " for the collapse of his leadership campaign " amid lack of mps ' support " .
this was , clearly , published before the weekend revelations ... which gave the magazine 's cover story an even more ironic twist .
the headline declares : " hot pursuit .
when the media attacks . "
it was , needless to say , about education secretary ruth kelly 's woes .
but i 'm sure mr oaten sympathises .
1700 gmt , thursday 9 february now there 's something you do n't see every day - tony blair singing the old socialist anthem the red flag .
even better , he was singing it from the commons despatch box surrounded by virtually his entire parliamentary party .
and he seemed to know the words - in the past he would almost certainly have feigned not to , for fear of being mistaken as a leftie .
it was all done for a celebration to mark the centenary of the labour party .
sadly , not a re-run of the famous occasion in 1976 when then tory minister michael heseltine grabbed the commons mace and held it over his head in fury at an outbreak of red flag singing by welsh mps .
this time it came at the end of commons business with the full agreement of the powers that be and , unsurprisingly , with not a single tory or lib dem mp in the chamber .
1430 gmt , tuesday 14 february lib dem mp lynne featherstone found herself in a tricky situation when faced with a hysterical constituent during her regular surgery .
she explains : " i know theoretically people used to say you are meant to slap someone who is hysterical around the face and the shock is supposed to bring them back to their senses .
" however , i hardly think that a viable or acceptable solution in this day and age ! "
quite .
a lesson , perhaps , for john prescott ? 1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .

conservative leader david cameron is thanking the labour party for his latest , soothing film .
he says his children love dave the chameleon - the cycle helmet-wearing reptile dreamed up by labour to lampoon mr cameron .
so whenever he wants a bit of peace and quiet , the tory leader simply sits them in front of labour 's latest political broadcast which features the character .
" what long term psychological effect that will have on my daughter i do not know , " he says .
another victory for labour 's pr team 1000 gmt , tuesday 23 may tory mps are demanding a public apology from the labour party after it emerged members , including ministers , took part in an auction for a copy of the hutton report into the death of dr david kelly which was autographed by cherie blair .
according to a commons motion tabled by peterborough 's stewart jackson , the event took place at the arts club in mayfair last week and raised £ 400 for party coffers .
the motion says the event was " in appalling bad taste , arrogant and crassly insensitive in seeking to make money , albeit indirectly , through hawking , as a novelty item , an official government report into the death of a public servant " .
it " regrets the distress caused to the family and friends of the late dr kelly ; and calls on the labour party to apologise for such tasteless and offensive conduct and to donate the money raised to an appropriate charity " .
a labour spokesman meanwhile said it had not been a party event .
" we know nothing about it , " he said .
1130 gmt , wednesday 28june what is it about the job of foreign secretary that inspires such a sense of shock and / or horror in ministers when they are handed the portfolio ?
margaret beckett has revealed in a newspaper interview that , when tony blair told her she was to be made foreign secretary , the only thing she could think to say in response was a four letter word .
" he told me he wanted me to go on working on climate change issues but to do it from the foreign office .
i was stunned , " she explained .
her reaction was " one word and four letters " beginning with an f. but , i learn , mrs beckett is not the only politician to have reacted in such a way to this particular promotion .
apparently when her predecessor , jack straw , was given the job he was also lost for words - apart from one four letter one , this time beginning with an s. now what i want to know is what word mr straw used when he heard he was being replaced by mrs beckett ...
1530 gmt , tuesday 4 july policemen at the palace of westminster are notorious for their mischievous sense of humour when it comes to dealing with tourists .
for example , they once nominated a camera-shy constable as the " official " pc to be photographed by visitors eager to be snapped with a british bobby .
but the latest wheeze takes the biscuit .
apparently when tourists ask why big ben has been silenced for work on the famous bell , they are told : " because it 's going digital . " 0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1030 gmt , wednesday 29 november has trendsetter tony blair set a new rule in lunchtime etiquette ?
the prime minister attended a swanky lunch with senior journalists on monday and was presented with a soup first course in a bowl with handles on each side - you know the sort of thing , like a double handled teacup .
as the other guests followed tradition and reached for their soup spoons , mr blair picked up his bowl by its handles and proceeded to drink it down with relish .
the surprised journos were n't exactly sure how to react to this - should they put down their spoons and follow suit or carry on regardless ?
they decided to ignore it and carried on slurping .
another sign of the prime minister 's waning influence perhaps ? 1030 gmt , thursday 2 november it is sometimes hard for cabinet ministers to let go when they are sacked or demoted and they all have their own ways of dealing with it .
former defence secretary and commons leader geoff hoon - demoted to europe minister in tony blair 's last re-shuffle - is eager , for example , to remind colleagues he may no longer be a full cabinet minister but is still allowed to sit in on the weekly meetings , although not vote .
the official plaque on his ministerial office leaves no room for doubt .
it has the usual label declaring that the rt hon geoff hoon is minister for europe , but adds " attending cabinet " .
so there .

prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
hill and blair were banned from roads the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1030 gmt , wednesday 29 november has trendsetter tony blair set a new rule in lunchtime etiquette ?
the prime minister attended a swanky lunch with senior journalists on monday and was presented with a soup first course in a bowl with handles on each side - you know the sort of thing , like a double handled teacup .
blair sets new etiquette rule as the other guests followed tradition and reached for their soup spoons , mr blair picked up his bowl by its handles and proceeded to drink it down with relish .
the surprised journos were n't exactly sure how to react to this - should they put down their spoons and follow suit or carry on regardless ?
they decided to ignore it and carried on slurping .
another sign of the prime minister 's waning influence perhaps ? 1030 gmt , thursday 2 november it is sometimes hard for cabinet ministers to let go when they are sacked or demoted and they all have their own ways of dealing with it .
former defence secretary and commons leader geoff hoon - demoted to europe minister in tony blair 's last re-shuffle - is eager , for example , to remind colleagues he may no longer be a full cabinet minister but is still allowed to sit in on the weekly meetings , although not vote .
the official plaque on his ministerial office leaves no room for doubt .
it has the usual label declaring that the rt hon geoff hoon is minister for europe , but adds " attending cabinet " .
so there .

1130 gmt , wednesday 28june what is it about the job of foreign secretary that inspires such a sense of shock and / or horror in ministers when they are handed the portfolio ?

" he told me he wanted me to go on working on climate change issues but to do it from the foreign office .

a lesson , perhaps , for john prescott ? 1530 gmt , monday 27 march the infamous rivalry between barely-dressed models jodie marsh and jordan will have nothing on this .
marsh and willis square up celebrity big brother contestant ms marsh - who was at loggerheads with respect mp george galloway , amongst others , on the show - has a new parliamentary hate figure in the shape of former liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
ms marsh is apparently incensed that mr willis has tabled a commons question demanding she be banned from touring schools as part of an anti-bullying campaign .
" what is it with these old duffers , " she declared .
" i seem to be tripping over mps who waste taxpayers ' money by having a go at me in a bid for fame and fortune . "
seeking fame and fortune ?
hardly .
mr willis said he had little idea who ms marsh was until a school pupil tipped him off about her planned tour and he visited her website .
" it 's absolutely appalling , " he said .
" there is no way she is the right sort of person to be going into our schools , " he told me .
1100 gmt , wednesday 26 april all parents know what it 's like trying to do ordinary household chores with the kids demanding attention .
and we also all know what a godsend videos -lrb- dvds nowadays -rrb- of their favourite cartoons can be .
dave the chameleon a hit with kids plonk them down in front of bob the builder or thomas the tank engine and tranquillity reigns .
conservative leader david cameron is thanking the labour party for his latest , soothing film .
he says his children love dave the chameleon - the cycle helmet-wearing reptile dreamed up by labour to lampoon mr cameron .
so whenever he wants a bit of peace and quiet , the tory leader simply sits them in front of labour 's latest political broadcast which features the character .
" what long term psychological effect that will have on my daughter i do not know , " he says .
another victory for labour 's pr team 1000 gmt , tuesday 23 may tory mps are demanding a public apology from the labour party after it emerged members , including ministers , took part in an auction for a copy of the hutton report into the death of dr david kelly which was autographed by cherie blair .
according to a commons motion tabled by peterborough 's stewart jackson , the event took place at the arts club in mayfair last week and raised £ 400 for party coffers .
the motion says the event was " in appalling bad taste , arrogant and crassly insensitive in seeking to make money , albeit indirectly , through hawking , as a novelty item , an official government report into the death of a public servant " .
it " regrets the distress caused to the family and friends of the late dr kelly ; and calls on the labour party to apologise for such tasteless and offensive conduct and to donate the money raised to an appropriate charity " .
a labour spokesman meanwhile said it had not been a party event .
" we know nothing about it , " he said .
1130 gmt , wednesday 28june what is it about the job of foreign secretary that inspires such a sense of shock and / or horror in ministers when they are handed the portfolio ?
margaret beckett has revealed in a newspaper interview that , when tony blair told her she was to be made foreign secretary , the only thing she could think to say in response was a four letter word .
" he told me he wanted me to go on working on climate change issues but to do it from the foreign office .
i was stunned , " she explained .
her reaction was " one word and four letters " beginning with an f. but , i learn , mrs beckett is not the only politician to have reacted in such a way to this particular promotion .
apparently when her predecessor , jack straw , was given the job he was also lost for words - apart from one four letter one , this time beginning with an s. now what i want to know is what word mr straw used when he heard he was being replaced by mrs beckett ...
1530 gmt , tuesday 4 july policemen at the palace of westminster are notorious for their mischievous sense of humour when it comes to dealing with tourists .
is big ben going digital ?
for example , they once nominated a camera-shy constable as the " official " pc to be photographed by visitors eager to be snapped with a british bobby .
but the latest wheeze takes the biscuit .
apparently when tourists ask why big ben has been silenced for work on the famous bell , they are told : " because it 's going digital . " 0930 gmt , wednesday 19 july for those who fear politicians believe they are above the law , here are a couple of cases where the law 's view that all men are equal -lrb- i.e either criminals or potential criminals -rrb- has held firm .
prime minister tony blair , who is already apparently preparing for a chat with the met on other matters , fell foul of an eagle eyed officer as he was planning a photocall with racing driver damon hill and a formula 1 car in downing street to mark the return of the motor show to london .
hill and blair were banned from roads the vehicle arrived in sections and was assembled in the ministry of defence car park opposite downing street .
but as technicians attempted to wheel it the short distance across whitehall to downing street they were informed by the officer that , as the car had no mot , tax or insurance it could not take to a public road .
so blair , hill and entourage had to walk across the road for the picture opportunity before returning to no 10 for a reception to mark the event .
and no , bernie ecclestone was nowhere in sight .
meanwhile , former liberal democrat leader charles kennedy discovered those colourful custodians of the tower of london , the beefeaters , are more than just tourist attractions .
mr kennedy was giving a tv interview near the tower when he was approached by one of the yeoman warders , to give them their real title , and told he was causing an obstruction and should " move along please " .
1030 gmt , wednesday 29 november has trendsetter tony blair set a new rule in lunchtime etiquette ?
the prime minister attended a swanky lunch with senior journalists on monday and was presented with a soup first course in a bowl with handles on each side - you know the sort of thing , like a double handled teacup .
blair sets new etiquette rule as the other guests followed tradition and reached for their soup spoons , mr blair picked up his bowl by its handles and proceeded to drink it down with relish .
the surprised journos were n't exactly sure how to react to this - should they put down their spoons and follow suit or carry on regardless ?
they decided to ignore it and carried on slurping .
another sign of the prime minister 's waning influence perhaps ? 1030 gmt , thursday 2 november it is sometimes hard for cabinet ministers to let go when they are sacked or demoted and they all have their own ways of dealing with it .
former defence secretary and commons leader geoff hoon - demoted to europe minister in tony blair 's last re-shuffle - is eager , for example , to remind colleagues he may no longer be a full cabinet minister but is still allowed to sit in on the weekly meetings , although not vote .
the official plaque on his ministerial office leaves no room for doubt .
it has the usual label declaring that the rt hon geoff hoon is minister for europe , but adds " attending cabinet " .
so there .

speaking from islamabad on tuesday , hussain 's brother amjad told the bbc : " the pakistan high commissioner phoned me last night to tell me we have an indefinite stay of execution .
" this is great news , but it is only a step in the right direction .
the family appealed for clemency to president musharraf " it is not the end of the road because i will not give up this campaign until my brother is freed and allowed to come back to his family in england .
" he has endured so much suffering emotionally , psychologically and physically - i wo n't rest until his nightmare ends . "
he said his brother was the victim of a miscarriage of justice which started when he took a taxi while visiting relatives in pakistan in 1988 .
the family said the taxi driver pulled out a gun and tried to physically and sexually assault him .
in the scuffle that followed the gun went off , fatally injuring the taxi driver .
sharia law hussain was tried and convicted of murder but , following an appeal , the death penalty was revoked and he was sentenced to life imprisonment .
following a second appeal , hussain was acquitted of all charges against him by the high court .
but when the case was re-opened in 1998 and he was re-tried under sharia law by the federal shariat court , the high court 's decision was reversed and he was sentenced to death again .
his case was taken up by the foreign secretary margaret beckett , who made representations at the highest levels in pakistan .
local mps greg mullholland and john battle and north west england mep sajjad karim also joined the campaign to prevent the execution .
' mood changed ' mr karim led a delegation of european politicians to islamabad last week in a bid to support the hussain family 's appeal .
amjad hussain said : " i saw my brother in prison last week and was shocked how old he looked .
" he said he had lost hope until i arrived and then his mood changed .
" i have n't been able to meet him since but at last he is being told he will not be executed .
" i now appeal to president musharraf and the authorities here to do the honourable thing and set my brother free . "

southern water said divining is used by some of its crews , although modern electrical equipment was mostly used .
divining rods and dowsing tools are associated by many with ancient skills and witchcraft , but some companies still use the technique .
the search for underground water operates by observation of the movement of a hand-held stick or a pointer .
' listening sticks ' lawrence gosden , utility services manager for southern water , said : " fixing leaks is our top priority .
we need to make sure we are doing everything we can to beat the drought .
" divining is one of the techniques used by some of our crews , although by far the majority of teams use modern electrical equipment to measure flows and listen for noises of potential leaks and burst water mains . "
he said many leaks in the company 's 13,500km network were very small and could sit underground , draining into the soil .
" we use a variety of techniques including listening sticks and digital correlators to listen carefully for the noise of a leak - there is a noise from a leak just the same as a gushing pipe above ground , " he said .
the south east is facing its worst drought in a century after two dry winters , with little chance of improvement until the autumn , the environment agency has said .
thirteen million people in the region have now been banned from using hosepipes in order to protect the public water supply .
