program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .

the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .

it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .

her visit will attract a good deal of international attention because she will be the first foreign leader to travel to the region since the palestinian elections on wednesday . the question of who she will meet in the palestinian territories was on everyone 's lips , but berlin has confirmed mekel will only hold talks with palestinian president mahmud abbas . " our only interlocutor is president -lrb- mahmud -rrb- abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure . wilhelm said friday that germany had four conditions for dialog with hamas : recognizing israel 's right to exist , renouncing violence , disarming , and upholding international commitments made in the context of the peace process . he said the government respected the outcome of the palestinian general election " as the will of the people " and described the poll as " free and fair . "
but he said that germany hoped any new members of a palestinian government would " live up to their responsibilities " . " the chancellor stresses her hope that the political forces in the palestinian territories will live up to their responsibilities and do everything in their power to seek an end to violence and develop their country , " he said . he said that the european union and the united states were coordinating closely on how to move forward " in this difficult situation " after the hamas victory . monday " quartet " meeting wilhelm noted the so-called mideast quartet - grouping the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - would meet monday in london to weigh the outcome of the poll and coordinate policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas the quartet said late thursday that " there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia activities and the building of a democratic state . " a two-state solution to the conflict requires all participants in the democratic process to renounce violence and terror , accept israel 's right to exist , and disarm . " funding some german officials said the eu should consider cutting off funding to the palestinian authority in the wake of the hamas win . " it is largely dependent on the behavior of hamas , " said overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" that is what will decide whether we as a government continue our aid for the people in the palestinian territories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is considered a terrorist group by the the eu , the us and israel the eu has said it stands ready to continue support for the palestinians but that it also expected hamas to commit to ending violence and supporting democratic principles . the european commission offered an aid package worth 280 million euros -lrb- 342 million dollars -rrb- to the palestinian people last year , of which 70 million was channelled to the palestinian authority through a world bank trust fund . time of political upheaval the chancellor 's timing for her first middle east trip comes during a period of political upheaval , and many in berlin wondered if the visit would actually take place given the circumstances . not only has the election of hamas resulted in a large question mark for the future of peace negotiations ; israel has had a caretaker government since early this month after veteran prime minister ariel sharon was hospitalized following a massive brain hemorrhage . and elections planned for march could result in a further change of the region 's political landscape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will meet with fatah 's mahmoud abbas , as well as with israeli officials as the first foreign leader to visit israel since ehud olmert took over as acting prime minister on jan .

" acknowledgement of israel 's security and its right of existence remains an unalterable corner stone of german foreign policy , " he said . no change in policy " at the same time the german government continues to back the international community 's road map for peace .
the palestinian people have a right to its own state that can exist side-by-side with israel in peace and security and within recognized borders . " wilhelm added merkel would speak with israeli officials about the recent anti-semitic outbursts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and tehran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear work . while in israel , the chancellor will pay tribute to victims of the holocaust by laying a wreath at the holocaust memorial yad vashem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .
almost every second tree is ailing .
in fact , the overall level of damage to the nation 's oaks has increased fivefold since 1984 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees in the national park in bavaria shows signs of ailing .
it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .

paziorek also said that the governing coalition also planned to subsidize wood-based heating . " permanently stressed out " but , the report has provoked much criticism from both opposition parties as well as environmental groups who say the government is n't doing enough to protect trees . for the first time , environment groups also presented an alternative report on the state of german forests , detailing the measures that they deem crucial to restoring the health of trees . the chairwoman of the environmental group bund , angelika zahrnt , said the forest was " permanently stressed out " and ordered a change of tack in the government 's transport policies . " you ca n't just keep building new streets , " said zahrnt , pointing out that that was exactly what the new government planned with its latest reform package . other organizations have put forth proposals that range from dropping the use of pesticides to reining in deforestation to formulating a modern hunting law that would cull stocks of wild boars and deer that often eat trees . farmers ' groups have also urged agriculture minister horst seehofer to promote ecological farming and create more jobs in forestry . germany using mountains of paper some of the most pointed criticism was reserved for germany 's massive consumption of paper , which the alternative report made germany one of the main culprits for the worldwide clearing of forests .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .
almost every second tree is ailing .
in fact , the overall level of damage to the nation 's oaks has increased fivefold since 1984 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees in the national park in bavaria shows signs of ailing .
it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .
at the world cyper games in singapore in november he was crowned " world champion 2005 . "
two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .
no one wants them to become the german champion again and everyone is against them .
you do n't hate them , but you do n't want them to win .

but latvia , which has fought hard to keep its own language , says no amount of eu rhetoric will change it back from eiro . latvia 's government has decided to change the euro to fit their language , in which europe is eiropa and euro eiro .
but the european central bank and other eu bodies have told the country it has gone too far .
latvia should use the standard written form when it adopts the currency in 2008 , the eu says . latvia , however , has remained steadfast , saying it will take the issue to the european court of justice if necessary .
it 's a matter of protecting both national heritage and eu ethics , according to latvian education minister ina druviete . " it 's not an issue of monetary policy .
it 's an issue of latvian language policy , and we have to protect our languages , " said druviete .
" the motto of the european union is unity in diversity , and languages are the most specific representation of this diversity .
i regret that officials from european institutions were so ignorant because it 's not a detail .
language is a representation of national identity , and any interference in such a subtle sphere would have very serious consequences . "
battle for latvian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least the symbol seems to work for everyone language protection is an extremely sensitive issue in latvia .
during soviet occupation , moscow forced russian on the nations that made up the ussr .
the result was the near death of the latvian language , not to mention the massive displacement of tens of thousands of latvian people to make space for russians to move in and impose a russian-language school system .
after latvia gained independence from the soviet union in 1991 , there was a countrywide drive to re-establish the latvian language .
today it 's spoken by two-thirds of the population .
latvian belongs to the baltic group of indo-european languages .
" it 's a language with ancient spelling traditions , and we have no such diphthong as ' eu ' in our language , " druviete explained . jane conway -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with europe 's multilingual reality as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .

" dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .

two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .
no one wants them to become the german champion again and everyone is against them .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .

a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .
almost every second tree is ailing .
in fact , the overall level of damage to the nation 's oaks has increased fivefold since 1984 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees in the national park in bavaria shows signs of ailing .
it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .
" the key is in rational energy use , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal-fired power plant in north rhine-westphalia the agriculture ministry has urged people to increase efforts to fight air pollution by using energy-efficient cars , heating systems , and household appliances .
it asks home owners to use environmentally-friendly methods when they renovate buildings . the government recently decided to promote the latter with four billion euros between 2006 and 2009 .
paziorek also said that the governing coalition also planned to subsidize wood-based heating . " permanently stressed out " but , the report has provoked much criticism from both opposition parties as well as environmental groups who say the government is n't doing enough to protect trees . for the first time , environment groups also presented an alternative report on the state of german forests , detailing the measures that they deem crucial to restoring the health of trees . the chairwoman of the environmental group bund , angelika zahrnt , said the forest was " permanently stressed out " and ordered a change of tack in the government 's transport policies . " you ca n't just keep building new streets , " said zahrnt , pointing out that that was exactly what the new government planned with its latest reform package . other organizations have put forth proposals that range from dropping the use of pesticides to reining in deforestation to formulating a modern hunting law that would cull stocks of wild boars and deer that often eat trees . farmers ' groups have also urged agriculture minister horst seehofer to promote ecological farming and create more jobs in forestry . germany using mountains of paper some of the most pointed criticism was reserved for germany 's massive consumption of paper , which the alternative report made germany one of the main culprits for the worldwide clearing of forests .
the report urged the government to popularize recycling paper , the use of which has declined in recent years . according to estimates , germany uses more paper than in africa and south america put together . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study says most of europe set to miss kyoto goals most of europe , which has criticized the united states over its stance on global warming , looks set to miss a set of goals to cut greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol , a new study shows .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .
at the world cyper games in singapore in november he was crowned " world champion 2005 . "
two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .
no one wants them to become the german champion again and everyone is against them .
you do n't hate them , but you do n't want them to win .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition .

"
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .
disl has been a mainstay in german biathlon , winning more than half of the country 's olympic medals in the women 's division . the men 's biathletes sven fischer and rico gross must overcome norwegian ole-einar björndalen to attain a coveted gold medal .
björndalen captured all four events at salt lake city . icy tubes have been good to germany the luge has been a regular provider of medals for germany in the past and that should n't change in turin .
39-year old georg hackl has been competing in the olympics since 1988 -lrb- silver in calgary -rrb- , bringing home three golds in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg hackl hopes to slide to gold again in what will probably be his last olympic appearance - although that has been the case for about a decade - hackl hopes to win his sixth medal .
should hackl , who has battled the flu this winter , miss his goal , david möller has the potential to win . the women lugers have been head and shoulders above their competition the past decade .
silke kraushaar , sylke otto and tatjana hüfner could easily divide the spoils amongst themselves . in the two-man luge , the duo of patrick leitner and alexander resch together with their colleagues andre florschutz and torsten wustlich will be fighting for a spot on the podium . no matter who wins or loses , if the conditions remain as they are currently in northern italy , no winter athlete can blame it on the weather if they come home empty-handed . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .

in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .

her visit will attract a good deal of international attention because she will be the first foreign leader to travel to the region since the palestinian elections on wednesday . the question of who she will meet in the palestinian territories was on everyone 's lips , but berlin has confirmed mekel will only hold talks with palestinian president mahmud abbas . " our only interlocutor is president -lrb- mahmud -rrb- abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure . wilhelm said friday that germany had four conditions for dialog with hamas : recognizing israel 's right to exist , renouncing violence , disarming , and upholding international commitments made in the context of the peace process . he said the government respected the outcome of the palestinian general election " as the will of the people " and described the poll as " free and fair . "
but he said that germany hoped any new members of a palestinian government would " live up to their responsibilities " . " the chancellor stresses her hope that the political forces in the palestinian territories will live up to their responsibilities and do everything in their power to seek an end to violence and develop their country , " he said . he said that the european union and the united states were coordinating closely on how to move forward " in this difficult situation " after the hamas victory . monday " quartet " meeting wilhelm noted the so-called mideast quartet - grouping the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - would meet monday in london to weigh the outcome of the poll and coordinate policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas the quartet said late thursday that " there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia activities and the building of a democratic state . " a two-state solution to the conflict requires all participants in the democratic process to renounce violence and terror , accept israel 's right to exist , and disarm . " funding some german officials said the eu should consider cutting off funding to the palestinian authority in the wake of the hamas win . " it is largely dependent on the behavior of hamas , " said overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" that is what will decide whether we as a government continue our aid for the people in the palestinian territories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is considered a terrorist group by the the eu , the us and israel the eu has said it stands ready to continue support for the palestinians but that it also expected hamas to commit to ending violence and supporting democratic principles . the european commission offered an aid package worth 280 million euros -lrb- 342 million dollars -rrb- to the palestinian people last year , of which 70 million was channelled to the palestinian authority through a world bank trust fund . time of political upheaval the chancellor 's timing for her first middle east trip comes during a period of political upheaval , and many in berlin wondered if the visit would actually take place given the circumstances . not only has the election of hamas resulted in a large question mark for the future of peace negotiations ; israel has had a caretaker government since early this month after veteran prime minister ariel sharon was hospitalized following a massive brain hemorrhage . and elections planned for march could result in a further change of the region 's political landscape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will meet with fatah 's mahmoud abbas , as well as with israeli officials as the first foreign leader to visit israel since ehud olmert took over as acting prime minister on jan .
4 , merkel will be watched closely .
she will meet with the leader for a working dinner monday and will hold talks with president moshe katsav , foreign minister tzipi livni , likud party chief benjamin netanyahu and labour party leader amir peretz . spokesman wilhelm said merkel would stress that germany 's position on the middle east remained unaltered .
" acknowledgement of israel 's security and its right of existence remains an unalterable corner stone of german foreign policy , " he said . no change in policy " at the same time the german government continues to back the international community 's road map for peace .
the palestinian people have a right to its own state that can exist side-by-side with israel in peace and security and within recognized borders . " wilhelm added merkel would speak with israeli officials about the recent anti-semitic outbursts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and tehran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear work . while in israel , the chancellor will pay tribute to victims of the holocaust by laying a wreath at the holocaust memorial yad vashem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .
at the world cyper games in singapore in november he was crowned " world champion 2005 . "
two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .
" i want to hunt bayern again . " that 's just what hamburg needs to do to pull ahead , but it may be more like taking aim at the dust munich leaves behind in its unstoppable run .
if hamburg is to come out on top , ailton needs to demonstrate the success he had with werder bremen -lrb- 28 goals -rrb- when he led the team to the league title in 2003/04 . bremen down but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose -lrb- l -rrb- separated his shoulder in cup loss third-placed werder bremen , now 11 points adrift of bayern , go into the second leg having to lick their wounds after losing a midweek cup match to regional side st. pauli . bremen travel to arminia bielefeld on sunday with doubts over german international striker miroslav klose , the bundesliga 's top scorer with 16 goals , who left the st. pauli game with a shoulder injury .
team officials expect him back in three weeks , as the injury proved less serious than originally feared . table closer at bottom down at the bottom of the table , things are very tight with nine teams - half of the teams in the bundesliga - concerned about falling into the second division . kaiserslautern , german champions in 1998 , prop up the rest , but msv duisburg and fc cologne are only above them on goal difference with the bottom three all on a meager 12 points . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more room for foreigners in bundesliga managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .
disl has been a mainstay in german biathlon , winning more than half of the country 's olympic medals in the women 's division . the men 's biathletes sven fischer and rico gross must overcome norwegian ole-einar björndalen to attain a coveted gold medal .
björndalen captured all four events at salt lake city . icy tubes have been good to germany the luge has been a regular provider of medals for germany in the past and that should n't change in turin .
39-year old georg hackl has been competing in the olympics since 1988 -lrb- silver in calgary -rrb- , bringing home three golds in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg hackl hopes to slide to gold again in what will probably be his last olympic appearance - although that has been the case for about a decade - hackl hopes to win his sixth medal .
should hackl , who has battled the flu this winter , miss his goal , david möller has the potential to win . the women lugers have been head and shoulders above their competition the past decade .
silke kraushaar , sylke otto and tatjana hüfner could easily divide the spoils amongst themselves . in the two-man luge , the duo of patrick leitner and alexander resch together with their colleagues andre florschutz and torsten wustlich will be fighting for a spot on the podium . no matter who wins or loses , if the conditions remain as they are currently in northern italy , no winter athlete can blame it on the weather if they come home empty-handed . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .

there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end .

it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .
disl has been a mainstay in german biathlon , winning more than half of the country 's olympic medals in the women 's division . the men 's biathletes sven fischer and rico gross must overcome norwegian ole-einar björndalen to attain a coveted gold medal .
björndalen captured all four events at salt lake city . icy tubes have been good to germany the luge has been a regular provider of medals for germany in the past and that should n't change in turin .
39-year old georg hackl has been competing in the olympics since 1988 -lrb- silver in calgary -rrb- , bringing home three golds in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg hackl hopes to slide to gold again in what will probably be his last olympic appearance - although that has been the case for about a decade - hackl hopes to win his sixth medal .
should hackl , who has battled the flu this winter , miss his goal , david möller has the potential to win . the women lugers have been head and shoulders above their competition the past decade .
silke kraushaar , sylke otto and tatjana hüfner could easily divide the spoils amongst themselves . in the two-man luge , the duo of patrick leitner and alexander resch together with their colleagues andre florschutz and torsten wustlich will be fighting for a spot on the podium . no matter who wins or loses , if the conditions remain as they are currently in northern italy , no winter athlete can blame it on the weather if they come home empty-handed . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .
almost every second tree is ailing .
in fact , the overall level of damage to the nation 's oaks has increased fivefold since 1984 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees in the national park in bavaria shows signs of ailing .
it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .
" the key is in rational energy use , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal-fired power plant in north rhine-westphalia the agriculture ministry has urged people to increase efforts to fight air pollution by using energy-efficient cars , heating systems , and household appliances .
it asks home owners to use environmentally-friendly methods when they renovate buildings . the government recently decided to promote the latter with four billion euros between 2006 and 2009 .
paziorek also said that the governing coalition also planned to subsidize wood-based heating . " permanently stressed out " but , the report has provoked much criticism from both opposition parties as well as environmental groups who say the government is n't doing enough to protect trees . for the first time , environment groups also presented an alternative report on the state of german forests , detailing the measures that they deem crucial to restoring the health of trees . the chairwoman of the environmental group bund , angelika zahrnt , said the forest was " permanently stressed out " and ordered a change of tack in the government 's transport policies . " you ca n't just keep building new streets , " said zahrnt , pointing out that that was exactly what the new government planned with its latest reform package . other organizations have put forth proposals that range from dropping the use of pesticides to reining in deforestation to formulating a modern hunting law that would cull stocks of wild boars and deer that often eat trees . farmers ' groups have also urged agriculture minister horst seehofer to promote ecological farming and create more jobs in forestry . germany using mountains of paper some of the most pointed criticism was reserved for germany 's massive consumption of paper , which the alternative report made germany one of the main culprits for the worldwide clearing of forests .

his statements come just two days ahead of the chancellor 's first visit to the middle east . merkel , who will travel to the region for the first time since her election , is also the first international leader to visit the palestinian territories since hamas victory in last week 's dramatic national elections .
she will , however , not meet with the islamic group . " our only interlocutor is president mahmud abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure sunday . recognize israel in an interview with german news weekly der spiegel steinmeier said that while germany accepted the outcome of the free elections , " hamas must give up violence and recognize israel 's right to exist . " " terrorism and democracy do not match , " he stressed .
" votes for hamas were not votes against peace or for a religious or ideological radicalization but for reforms in palestine .
we must respect this wish . " hamas won an overwhelming majority , capturing 76 of the 132 seats in the national parliament , leaving the fatah party a distant second . disarm fighters israeli ambassador to germany schimon stein called on merkel to insist in her talks with abbas that he respect his promise to disarm palestinian fighters . " this is the moment of truth : this promise must be kept , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the item should be high on merkel 's agenda when she visits the west bank town of ramallah on monday , he said . stein appealed to germany and the european union to make it absolutely clear that there is a fundamental contradiction between an armed group sponsoring terrorist activities and the building of a democratic state . according to paul spiegel , the head of the central council of jews in germany , berlin plays a very important role in the peace process .
under no circumstances whatsoever should germany conduct talks with hamas as long as they continue to fight for the destruction of israel . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel will not see hamas officials on mideast trip german chancellor angela merkel , the first foreign leader to visit the palestinian territories since elections there , will not meet hamas officials despite the radical islamic group 's dramatic victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .
disl has been a mainstay in german biathlon , winning more than half of the country 's olympic medals in the women 's division . the men 's biathletes sven fischer and rico gross must overcome norwegian ole-einar björndalen to attain a coveted gold medal .
björndalen captured all four events at salt lake city . icy tubes have been good to germany the luge has been a regular provider of medals for germany in the past and that should n't change in turin .
39-year old georg hackl has been competing in the olympics since 1988 -lrb- silver in calgary -rrb- , bringing home three golds in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg hackl hopes to slide to gold again in what will probably be his last olympic appearance - although that has been the case for about a decade - hackl hopes to win his sixth medal .
should hackl , who has battled the flu this winter , miss his goal , david möller has the potential to win . the women lugers have been head and shoulders above their competition the past decade .
silke kraushaar , sylke otto and tatjana hüfner could easily divide the spoils amongst themselves . in the two-man luge , the duo of patrick leitner and alexander resch together with their colleagues andre florschutz and torsten wustlich will be fighting for a spot on the podium . no matter who wins or loses , if the conditions remain as they are currently in northern italy , no winter athlete can blame it on the weather if they come home empty-handed . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strings and skis in bavaria 's living picture book nestled in the bavarian alps , this picturesque town was for years one of the best kept secrets among ski travellers .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .
at the world cyper games in singapore in november he was crowned " world champion 2005 . "
two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .
no one wants them to become the german champion again and everyone is against them .
you do n't hate them , but you do n't want them to win .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .
disl has been a mainstay in german biathlon , winning more than half of the country 's olympic medals in the women 's division . the men 's biathletes sven fischer and rico gross must overcome norwegian ole-einar björndalen to attain a coveted gold medal .
björndalen captured all four events at salt lake city . icy tubes have been good to germany the luge has been a regular provider of medals for germany in the past and that should n't change in turin .
39-year old georg hackl has been competing in the olympics since 1988 -lrb- silver in calgary -rrb- , bringing home three golds in the process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg hackl hopes to slide to gold again in what will probably be his last olympic appearance - although that has been the case for about a decade - hackl hopes to win his sixth medal .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .

they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .

" dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .

in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .

the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

his statements come just two days ahead of the chancellor 's first visit to the middle east . merkel , who will travel to the region for the first time since her election , is also the first international leader to visit the palestinian territories since hamas victory in last week 's dramatic national elections .
she will , however , not meet with the islamic group . " our only interlocutor is president mahmud abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure sunday . recognize israel in an interview with german news weekly der spiegel steinmeier said that while germany accepted the outcome of the free elections , " hamas must give up violence and recognize israel 's right to exist . " " terrorism and democracy do not match , " he stressed .
" votes for hamas were not votes against peace or for a religious or ideological radicalization but for reforms in palestine .
we must respect this wish . " hamas won an overwhelming majority , capturing 76 of the 132 seats in the national parliament , leaving the fatah party a distant second . disarm fighters israeli ambassador to germany schimon stein called on merkel to insist in her talks with abbas that he respect his promise to disarm palestinian fighters . " this is the moment of truth : this promise must be kept , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the item should be high on merkel 's agenda when she visits the west bank town of ramallah on monday , he said . stein appealed to germany and the european union to make it absolutely clear that there is a fundamental contradiction between an armed group sponsoring terrorist activities and the building of a democratic state . according to paul spiegel , the head of the central council of jews in germany , berlin plays a very important role in the peace process .
under no circumstances whatsoever should germany conduct talks with hamas as long as they continue to fight for the destruction of israel . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel will not see hamas officials on mideast trip german chancellor angela merkel , the first foreign leader to visit the palestinian territories since elections there , will not meet hamas officials despite the radical islamic group 's dramatic victory .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .

a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end .

it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .

his statements come just two days ahead of the chancellor 's first visit to the middle east . merkel , who will travel to the region for the first time since her election , is also the first international leader to visit the palestinian territories since hamas victory in last week 's dramatic national elections .
she will , however , not meet with the islamic group . " our only interlocutor is president mahmud abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure sunday . recognize israel in an interview with german news weekly der spiegel steinmeier said that while germany accepted the outcome of the free elections , " hamas must give up violence and recognize israel 's right to exist . " " terrorism and democracy do not match , " he stressed .
" votes for hamas were not votes against peace or for a religious or ideological radicalization but for reforms in palestine .
we must respect this wish . " hamas won an overwhelming majority , capturing 76 of the 132 seats in the national parliament , leaving the fatah party a distant second . disarm fighters israeli ambassador to germany schimon stein called on merkel to insist in her talks with abbas that he respect his promise to disarm palestinian fighters . " this is the moment of truth : this promise must be kept , " stein said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the item should be high on merkel 's agenda when she visits the west bank town of ramallah on monday , he said . stein appealed to germany and the european union to make it absolutely clear that there is a fundamental contradiction between an armed group sponsoring terrorist activities and the building of a democratic state . according to paul spiegel , the head of the central council of jews in germany , berlin plays a very important role in the peace process .
under no circumstances whatsoever should germany conduct talks with hamas as long as they continue to fight for the destruction of israel . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel will not see hamas officials on mideast trip german chancellor angela merkel , the first foreign leader to visit the palestinian territories since elections there , will not meet hamas officials despite the radical islamic group 's dramatic victory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .
" i want to hunt bayern again . " that 's just what hamburg needs to do to pull ahead , but it may be more like taking aim at the dust munich leaves behind in its unstoppable run .
if hamburg is to come out on top , ailton needs to demonstrate the success he had with werder bremen -lrb- 28 goals -rrb- when he led the team to the league title in 2003/04 . bremen down but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose -lrb- l -rrb- separated his shoulder in cup loss third-placed werder bremen , now 11 points adrift of bayern , go into the second leg having to lick their wounds after losing a midweek cup match to regional side st. pauli . bremen travel to arminia bielefeld on sunday with doubts over german international striker miroslav klose , the bundesliga 's top scorer with 16 goals , who left the st. pauli game with a shoulder injury .
team officials expect him back in three weeks , as the injury proved less serious than originally feared . table closer at bottom down at the bottom of the table , things are very tight with nine teams - half of the teams in the bundesliga - concerned about falling into the second division . kaiserslautern , german champions in 1998 , prop up the rest , but msv duisburg and fc cologne are only above them on goal difference with the bottom three all on a meager 12 points . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more room for foreigners in bundesliga managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .
almost every second tree is ailing .
in fact , the overall level of damage to the nation 's oaks has increased fivefold since 1984 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trees in the national park in bavaria shows signs of ailing .
it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .
" the key is in rational energy use , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coal-fired power plant in north rhine-westphalia the agriculture ministry has urged people to increase efforts to fight air pollution by using energy-efficient cars , heating systems , and household appliances .
it asks home owners to use environmentally-friendly methods when they renovate buildings . the government recently decided to promote the latter with four billion euros between 2006 and 2009 .
paziorek also said that the governing coalition also planned to subsidize wood-based heating . " permanently stressed out " but , the report has provoked much criticism from both opposition parties as well as environmental groups who say the government is n't doing enough to protect trees . for the first time , environment groups also presented an alternative report on the state of german forests , detailing the measures that they deem crucial to restoring the health of trees . the chairwoman of the environmental group bund , angelika zahrnt , said the forest was " permanently stressed out " and ordered a change of tack in the government 's transport policies .

her visit will attract a good deal of international attention because she will be the first foreign leader to travel to the region since the palestinian elections on wednesday . the question of who she will meet in the palestinian territories was on everyone 's lips , but berlin has confirmed mekel will only hold talks with palestinian president mahmud abbas . " our only interlocutor is president -lrb- mahmud -rrb- abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure . wilhelm said friday that germany had four conditions for dialog with hamas : recognizing israel 's right to exist , renouncing violence , disarming , and upholding international commitments made in the context of the peace process . he said the government respected the outcome of the palestinian general election " as the will of the people " and described the poll as " free and fair . "
but he said that germany hoped any new members of a palestinian government would " live up to their responsibilities " . " the chancellor stresses her hope that the political forces in the palestinian territories will live up to their responsibilities and do everything in their power to seek an end to violence and develop their country , " he said . he said that the european union and the united states were coordinating closely on how to move forward " in this difficult situation " after the hamas victory . monday " quartet " meeting wilhelm noted the so-called mideast quartet - grouping the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - would meet monday in london to weigh the outcome of the poll and coordinate policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas the quartet said late thursday that " there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia activities and the building of a democratic state .

" funding some german officials said the eu should consider cutting off funding to the palestinian authority in the wake of the hamas win . " it is largely dependent on the behavior of hamas , " said overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" that is what will decide whether we as a government continue our aid for the people in the palestinian territories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is considered a terrorist group by the the eu , the us and israel the eu has said it stands ready to continue support for the palestinians but that it also expected hamas to commit to ending violence and supporting democratic principles . the european commission offered an aid package worth 280 million euros -lrb- 342 million dollars -rrb- to the palestinian people last year , of which 70 million was channelled to the palestinian authority through a world bank trust fund . time of political upheaval the chancellor 's timing for her first middle east trip comes during a period of political upheaval , and many in berlin wondered if the visit would actually take place given the circumstances . not only has the election of hamas resulted in a large question mark for the future of peace negotiations ; israel has had a caretaker government since early this month after veteran prime minister ariel sharon was hospitalized following a massive brain hemorrhage . and elections planned for march could result in a further change of the region 's political landscape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will meet with fatah 's mahmoud abbas , as well as with israeli officials as the first foreign leader to visit israel since ehud olmert took over as acting prime minister on jan .

she will meet with the leader for a working dinner monday and will hold talks with president moshe katsav , foreign minister tzipi livni , likud party chief benjamin netanyahu and labour party leader amir peretz . spokesman wilhelm said merkel would stress that germany 's position on the middle east remained unaltered .
" acknowledgement of israel 's security and its right of existence remains an unalterable corner stone of german foreign policy , " he said . no change in policy " at the same time the german government continues to back the international community 's road map for peace .
the palestinian people have a right to its own state that can exist side-by-side with israel in peace and security and within recognized borders . " wilhelm added merkel would speak with israeli officials about the recent anti-semitic outbursts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and tehran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear work . while in israel , the chancellor will pay tribute to victims of the holocaust by laying a wreath at the holocaust memorial yad vashem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .
in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia as diplomatic efforts to curb iran 's nuclear ambitions near the un , the european powers are working to ensure tehran 's compliance .
to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action .

her visit will attract a good deal of international attention because she will be the first foreign leader to travel to the region since the palestinian elections on wednesday . the question of who she will meet in the palestinian territories was on everyone 's lips , but berlin has confirmed mekel will only hold talks with palestinian president mahmud abbas . " our only interlocutor is president -lrb- mahmud -rrb- abbas , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said ahead of merkel 's departure . wilhelm said friday that germany had four conditions for dialog with hamas : recognizing israel 's right to exist , renouncing violence , disarming , and upholding international commitments made in the context of the peace process . he said the government respected the outcome of the palestinian general election " as the will of the people " and described the poll as " free and fair . "
but he said that germany hoped any new members of a palestinian government would " live up to their responsibilities " . " the chancellor stresses her hope that the political forces in the palestinian territories will live up to their responsibilities and do everything in their power to seek an end to violence and develop their country , " he said . he said that the european union and the united states were coordinating closely on how to move forward " in this difficult situation " after the hamas victory . monday " quartet " meeting wilhelm noted the so-called mideast quartet - grouping the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - would meet monday in london to weigh the outcome of the poll and coordinate policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian supporters of islamic hamas the quartet said late thursday that " there is a fundamental contradiction between armed group and militia activities and the building of a democratic state . " a two-state solution to the conflict requires all participants in the democratic process to renounce violence and terror , accept israel 's right to exist , and disarm . " funding some german officials said the eu should consider cutting off funding to the palestinian authority in the wake of the hamas win . " it is largely dependent on the behavior of hamas , " said overseas development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" that is what will decide whether we as a government continue our aid for the people in the palestinian territories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas is considered a terrorist group by the the eu , the us and israel the eu has said it stands ready to continue support for the palestinians but that it also expected hamas to commit to ending violence and supporting democratic principles . the european commission offered an aid package worth 280 million euros -lrb- 342 million dollars -rrb- to the palestinian people last year , of which 70 million was channelled to the palestinian authority through a world bank trust fund . time of political upheaval the chancellor 's timing for her first middle east trip comes during a period of political upheaval , and many in berlin wondered if the visit would actually take place given the circumstances . not only has the election of hamas resulted in a large question mark for the future of peace negotiations ; israel has had a caretaker government since early this month after veteran prime minister ariel sharon was hospitalized following a massive brain hemorrhage . and elections planned for march could result in a further change of the region 's political landscape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will meet with fatah 's mahmoud abbas , as well as with israeli officials as the first foreign leader to visit israel since ehud olmert took over as acting prime minister on jan .

she will meet with the leader for a working dinner monday and will hold talks with president moshe katsav , foreign minister tzipi livni , likud party chief benjamin netanyahu and labour party leader amir peretz . spokesman wilhelm said merkel would stress that germany 's position on the middle east remained unaltered .
" acknowledgement of israel 's security and its right of existence remains an unalterable corner stone of german foreign policy , " he said . no change in policy " at the same time the german government continues to back the international community 's road map for peace .
the palestinian people have a right to its own state that can exist side-by-side with israel in peace and security and within recognized borders . " wilhelm added merkel would speak with israeli officials about the recent anti-semitic outbursts by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad and tehran 's decision to resume sensitive nuclear work . while in israel , the chancellor will pay tribute to victims of the holocaust by laying a wreath at the holocaust memorial yad vashem . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de west dismayed by hamas win ; calls for policy change there has been a chorus of western dismay thursday at the victory of hamas in palestinian elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2006 mittal plans global steel domination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : privately-owned dutch steelmaker mittal has launched a bidding war mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor . mittal steel , of indian origins and now the leading steel group by production volume , announced on friday it was planning to launch an 18.6-billion-euro -lrb- 22.8-billion-dollar -rrb- takeover bid in a move that would create the world 's largest steel company .
if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .
" i want to hunt bayern again . " that 's just what hamburg needs to do to pull ahead , but it may be more like taking aim at the dust munich leaves behind in its unstoppable run .
if hamburg is to come out on top , ailton needs to demonstrate the success he had with werder bremen -lrb- 28 goals -rrb- when he led the team to the league title in 2003/04 . bremen down but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose -lrb- l -rrb- separated his shoulder in cup loss third-placed werder bremen , now 11 points adrift of bayern , go into the second leg having to lick their wounds after losing a midweek cup match to regional side st. pauli . bremen travel to arminia bielefeld on sunday with doubts over german international striker miroslav klose , the bundesliga 's top scorer with 16 goals , who left the st. pauli game with a shoulder injury .
team officials expect him back in three weeks , as the injury proved less serious than originally feared . table closer at bottom down at the bottom of the table , things are very tight with nine teams - half of the teams in the bundesliga - concerned about falling into the second division . kaiserslautern , german champions in 1998 , prop up the rest , but msv duisburg and fc cologne are only above them on goal difference with the bottom three all on a meager 12 points . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more room for foreigners in bundesliga managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .

there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder .

the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition .

"
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .

but is video gaming a sport ? when the 22-year-old twins daniel and dennis schellhase enter a soccer pitch , they switch their names to hero and styla .
a nickname is necessary in their business , they say . their business is fifa , a videogame in which participants play soccer .
but to daniel and dennis , it is about much more than scoring goals as a hobby : they have been world champions a few times - an achievement that has earned them more than 100,000 euros . these so called legendary " fifa twins " are known as the most famous and successful " e-sportsmen " in germany .
and they maintain that videogames is a sport . " if you can call chess a sport , then playing videogames like fifa is definitely a proper sport , too , " said dennis schellhase .
" you have to be nimble , you have to practice , you have to react quickly and you must identify your opponent 's game plan - which is part of other sports , too .
the only real difference is that you do n't actually have to run and move yourself . " and as in all sports , says daniel schellhase , no pain , no gain . " if there is a world championship coming up , then you have to practise more than two hours a day , of course , " he said .
" and then sometimes you realize when you want to start that your fingers hurt , that they twinge and twitch quite badly .
that happens regularly . " sometimes a taste of real fame if daniel and dennis lived in hong kong , shanghai or beijing , no one would dare to question the importance of what they are doing .
they would be pop stars ; their fifa matches would be aired on tv ; and girls would be screaming and fainting in their presence .
that is exactly what happens whenever the fifa-twins play tournaments in asia . it is different in their hometown of gelsenkirchen , a down-to-earth town in the industrial center of germany .
although sometimes hero and styler do get a taste of what real fame is like at home , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is another fifa world championship as well " we do n't feel like it , but very often young people we meet think of us as celebrities , " said daniel schellhase .
" they come up and talk to us and we get e-mails from fans .
by now we are recognized in the area and even when we go shopping in another town or when we are out at a nightclub . " dennis schellhase says that the two did n't feel comfortable with the attention or the questions at first . " at first we were a bit shy about it all because gaming is not always viewed positively , " he said .
" in the past , you quickly got labelled a computer nerd when you spent a lot of time with computers .
fortunately today , people know that 's not always the case . " not geeks and the twins actually are far from being computer nerds even though they study computer science .
they do n't look like geeks either with their spiked bleached blond hair and their trendy outfits .
they are part of a real soccer team and even have time for girlfriends .
in fact , it seems they do everything together , work together , live together , split their prize money .
they say it is all very harmonious , almost . " you get mad sometimes while playing matches at home but at tournaments you are happy when your brother is up there representing the family even though you yourself did n't actually do well , " said daniel schellhase .
" then you are glad because you get half of the prize money , too . " dennis schellhase was the last one of them to stand on the winner 's podium .
at the world cyper games in singapore in november he was crowned " world champion 2005 . "
two years ago in korea , the dynamic duo even competed against each other in the finals - and won the team competition . the olympics next ? now a new dream keeps them heading to the game pad - to take part in the 2008 olympic games 2008 in peking . while not well-known , organisers of the games are debating whether to include e-sports in the support program .
if that happens , styla and hero will definitely be among those chosen to compete . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cyber games last year in shanghai attracted thousands and even though both feel flattered by the attention around them , they say there is a price to their fame . " no matter what field you are successful in , you wo n't be popular , " said daniel schellhase .
" people get jealous of your success .
it is just like in the german soccer league with bayern munich .
no one wants them to become the german champion again and everyone is against them .
you do n't hate them , but you do n't want them to win .

it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .

a new study shows that increasing air and soil pollution have taken a heavy toll on the country 's trees . the german oak tree seems to be in need of constant medical care .

it 's not just the much-loved oak that 's suffering .
a report presented this week by the agriculture and forestry ministry in berlin showed that beech trees as well have gotten very sick over the last two decades .
the news was only slightly better when it came to conifers : every third fir tree is sick and only every fifth pine tree is under the weather , the report said . " the health of the german forest remains a source of worry , " said deputy agriculture minister , peter paziorek this week . more energy-efficient measures needed experts say the main reasons for the dismal state of the forests are air pollution caused by more vehicle traffic , soil depletion due to agricultural activity , extreme weather conditions and bug infestation . in addition , the record heat wave that struck germany in 2003 also took a heavy toll on trees , many of which have never fully recovered . paziorek underlined that the damage wrought by air pollution had to be stemmed .

" you ca n't just keep building new streets , " said zahrnt , pointing out that that was exactly what the new government planned with its latest reform package . other organizations have put forth proposals that range from dropping the use of pesticides to reining in deforestation to formulating a modern hunting law that would cull stocks of wild boars and deer that often eat trees . farmers ' groups have also urged agriculture minister horst seehofer to promote ecological farming and create more jobs in forestry . germany using mountains of paper some of the most pointed criticism was reserved for germany 's massive consumption of paper , which the alternative report made germany one of the main culprits for the worldwide clearing of forests .

2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .
" i want to hunt bayern again . " that 's just what hamburg needs to do to pull ahead , but it may be more like taking aim at the dust munich leaves behind in its unstoppable run .
if hamburg is to come out on top , ailton needs to demonstrate the success he had with werder bremen -lrb- 28 goals -rrb- when he led the team to the league title in 2003/04 . bremen down but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose -lrb- l -rrb- separated his shoulder in cup loss third-placed werder bremen , now 11 points adrift of bayern , go into the second leg having to lick their wounds after losing a midweek cup match to regional side st. pauli . bremen travel to arminia bielefeld on sunday with doubts over german international striker miroslav klose , the bundesliga 's top scorer with 16 goals , who left the st. pauli game with a shoulder injury .
team officials expect him back in three weeks , as the injury proved less serious than originally feared . table closer at bottom down at the bottom of the table , things are very tight with nine teams - half of the teams in the bundesliga - concerned about falling into the second division . kaiserslautern , german champions in 1998 , prop up the rest , but msv duisburg and fc cologne are only above them on goal difference with the bottom three all on a meager 12 points . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more room for foreigners in bundesliga managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

to do that , say experts , they will need russia , and the threat of military action .

there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .
us president george w. bush has also thrown his weight behind the russian compromise offer . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the iran nuclear dispute in this selection of articles , dw-world documents the escalation of the dispute over iran 's nuclear program .

for title contenders hamburg and bremen , it is now or never to catch the bavarians . dutch international roy makaay had a poor first round in the bundesliga .
after a scorching start with six goals in the first three matches , the striker seemingly broke off all contact with his teammates , finding the net only two more times in the remaining 14 first leg matches . at mönchengladbach , the dutchman struck twice to help secure a 3-1 bayern victory , which boost their lead for the time being to nine points over second-place hamburg .
midfield director michael ballack , very likely ready to move to greener pastures at the end of this season , boosted his stock by scoring the third goal . below freezing temperatures at the borussia park by no means deterred bayern coach felix magath 's side from picking up where they left off in the first leg bringing their victory total to an incredible 15 in 18 matches . hamburg and bremen must pick up their play another notch and avoid any stumbles if they want to catch the 18-time bundesliga champions who had " the old makaay " in friday 's match , as magath put it . six-point lead " not a problem " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton begins his hunt against bayern in a hamburg uniform hamburg management is hoping ailton , on loan for the second leg from besiktas istanbul , will add some extra punch to a side that has a solid defense but is lacking scoring power . " i am delighted to be back in germany and hope to have 17 great games for hamburg in the second half of the season , " ailton said .
" i want to hunt bayern again . " that 's just what hamburg needs to do to pull ahead , but it may be more like taking aim at the dust munich leaves behind in its unstoppable run .
if hamburg is to come out on top , ailton needs to demonstrate the success he had with werder bremen -lrb- 28 goals -rrb- when he led the team to the league title in 2003/04 . bremen down but not out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose -lrb- l -rrb- separated his shoulder in cup loss third-placed werder bremen , now 11 points adrift of bayern , go into the second leg having to lick their wounds after losing a midweek cup match to regional side st. pauli . bremen travel to arminia bielefeld on sunday with doubts over german international striker miroslav klose , the bundesliga 's top scorer with 16 goals , who left the st. pauli game with a shoulder injury .
team officials expect him back in three weeks , as the injury proved less serious than originally feared . table closer at bottom down at the bottom of the table , things are very tight with nine teams - half of the teams in the bundesliga - concerned about falling into the second division . kaiserslautern , german champions in 1998 , prop up the rest , but msv duisburg and fc cologne are only above them on goal difference with the bottom three all on a meager 12 points . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more room for foreigners in bundesliga managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition . " it 's interesting , and it will certainly get a lot of attention " from the competition commission , kroes told reporters on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos . a spokesman for automaker peugeot said saturday that it would follow the bidding closely , given the fact " that we already have concerns about the state of competition in the steel sector . "
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .
only three days ago , arcelor had offered to make a friendly bid for dofasco at 71.0 canadian dollars per share , forcing thyssenkrupp to withdraw its bids to acquire the canadian company . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's thyssenkrupp to buy canadian steel maker germany 's largest steel maker , thyssenkrupp , announced its offer for a friendly takeover of the canadian steel maker dofasco , beating last week 's hostile offer from arcelor .

if mittal succeeds in swallowing european group arcelor , it would have with an annual production of 100 million tons , dwarfing number two nippon steel corp of japan , which produces about 33 million tons each year . mittal chief executive lakshmi mittal said he did not expect the proposed deal to face any regulatory hurdles and that the group would begin " friendly discussions " with arcelor and with european regulators soon .
but the luxembourg-based steelmaker dismissed such gestures and said it considered the takeover bid as hostile . arcelor 's board is scheduled to convene sunday to discuss the move , which has shocked many in the grand duchy .
the steelmaker is the country 's largest employer with some 6,000 jobs in four locations and the state is a stake-holder . " the government is going to wait for the board of directors to take a position before setting out its position , " luxembourg economy minister jeannot krecke told a news conference .
" we have a strategy and several options remain open , " he said without going into detail . prime minister jean-claude juncker will meet with the indian tycoon on tuesday . a european concern meanwhile , french economy and finance minister thierry breton said his government was " concerned " and was following developments " with the greatest attention " because of " its implications for european and french industry and employment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arcelor is a major european employer arcelor is the world 's second-largest steelmaker behind mittal , and a large part of its production base is in france .
the group was formed four years ago when three european steelmakers agreed to merge : luxembourg 's arbed , spain 's aceralia and france 's usinor . eu examines bid eu competition commissioner neelie kroes said that a hostile bid would be thoroughly examined for a potential dominant market position , which would violate the bloc 's position on free market competition .

"
the concerns are understandable , considering it takes nearly a ton of steel to produce a single car . thyssenkrupp could profit mittal 's bid , which also affects dofasco of canada and thyssenkrupp of germany , could spark a sector-wide bidding war for arcelor and put other steel groups in the spotlight for takeovers . the netherlands-based giant , which rose from modest beginnings in india 30 years ago , said it had agreed to sell leading canadian steel-maker dofasco , which is currently in the process of being acquired by arcelor , to thyssenkrupp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp 's steel plant in duisburg mittal , which has steel-making facilities in 14 countries around the world and employs 175,000 people , said it would sell dofasco to thyssenkrupp at a price of 68.0 canadian dollars per share .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .
she looks to set a record in longevity .
she has won the 5,000-meter gold in consecutive three olympics , equaling the american bonnie blair 's record .
one more trip to the top of the podium is her goal . in the 500-meter sprint event , jenny wolf has come from nowhere this season to be a favorite . circuits better than slopes where the germans hope to make up lost ground against the scandinavians is in the nordic events , long a predictable source of medals for norway .
tobias angerer has risen to the top of cross-country skiing this winter .
the german leads norwegian tor arne hetland in the world cup overall standings , having scored five victories in his favored events of long distance and pursuit . axel teichmann and rene sommerfeldt are equally capable of winning and the relay team promises to be amongst the top three in turin . even more certain of returning to germany with glittery medals , hopefully of the yellow kind , are the women biathletes .
norway 's live grete poiree is currently the cream of the crop but has yet to win olympic gold .
she faces a tough challenge from 2002 olympic gold medalist kati wilhelm of germany in the sprint and silver medalist in the pursuit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kati wilhelm and uschi disl took gold and silver in the 7.5-km biathlon in salt lake city the relay team looks to dominate that event with the steady hands german female athlete of the year 2005 uschi disl , martina glagow , katja beer and andrea henkel leading the charge .

the gold diggers wo n't come from the highlight events like alpine skiing and figure skating , but germany hopes to finish on top ahead of rivals norway . while the turin olympic organizers scramble to complete preparations for the two-week sporting spectacle that begins on february 10 , more bad news trickled in on saturday .
poor weather in the form of too much snow forced the olympic flame relay to take a day off along the swiss border . but the snowy conditions are good news for the athletes who will be competing on the white powder on the slopes , trails and ski jump hills .
mother nature is doing everything she can to make sure that the athletes can perform under optimal conditions . the german olympic team , 162 strong , will arrive in italy with high hopes .
in salt lake city in 2002 , the squad took home the most medals - 36 in all - but came in second in the all-important gold medal count , one behind winter sport powerhouse norway . germany wo n't overtake the norwegians with first-place efforts from the athletes in the high-profile events like alpine skiing or figure skating .
not since the high-speed efforts of katja seizinger -lrb- two-time gold medal winner in nagano in 1998 -rrb- and katharina witt 's artistic jumps on the ice has germany produced serious medal contenders in skiing and figure skating . gold hopes on the oval one person who should make sure that germany will surpass their 12 gold medals at salt lake is speed skater anni friesinger .
in 2002 , she raced to the 1,500-meter gold , and is the reigning champion in the 5,000-meter event and shines also in 3,000 and 1,000 meters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anni friesinger , right , and claudia pechstein her compatriot and rival claudia pechstein has other thoughts in mind .

munich-based siemens has been one of the biggest profiteers of the mammoth-sized task by cup organizers . soccer stadiums just aren ’ t what they used to be .
the day of the multi-purpose arenas are history .
more features and services are available and if the stadium is new , then the athletic track will no longer hinder the complete experience for fans by putting an additional 10 to 50 meters between them and the pitch because it is no longer there . single-purpose structures - temples is probably a more appropriate word - are in and they are extremely high-tech . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is quite aware of this .
in fact , in the association 's charter it is written black on white that the dfb must maintain the highest standards possible and constantly keep up with the developments of the times . solutions for all kinds of problems to do this , the dfb draws its equipment from and works closely together with munich-based technology giant siemens . " we are always challenged when the national squad plays a match .
we constantly have to deal with the local infrastructure .
our organization department is able to do this only if it can competently have its say , " said dfb marketing head horst lichtner recently at a technology forum at the allianz arena in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is directing the world cup 's infrastructure efforts the competence comes from siemens who provides solutions for areas ranging from environmental expertise to utility services , from ticket sales to , of course , communications and information technology . the sports and business worlds are not far apart .
with innovations , competitive advantages are gained that could make the difference between success and failure .
this is particularly true when it comes to technology according to josef winter , director of siemens germany division . sports stadiums generate revenue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allianz arena : munich soccer 's palace the allianz arena in munich , the crown jewel of german soccer stadiums , and home to the king of german clubs , bayern munich , opened at the start of the current season and is exemplary of just how much things have changed . " although we have installed technology in all 12 world cup stadiums and in other stadiums in germany and europe , we have clearly done the most in munich , " said winter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police will be using surveillance cameras installed by siemens and for good reason .
equipping athletic venues is a lucrative business .
the cost of electronic equipment in modern soccer stadiums adds up from between 10 to 20 percent of the price tag .
the final price of the allianz arena was a dear 280 million euros -lrb- $ 336 million -rrb- and siemens was greatly involved in the stadium shell 's lighting , surveillance cameras and sound system just to name a few areas . fans coming to the stadium also enjoy the benefits of siemens smart ticket system .
not only can ticket holders enter the stadium with the smart ticket , it 's also a debit card with which fans can purchase food , beverages and other articles . getting to the grounds should be easier if one moves away from the appearances and conveniences of germany 's marquis stadium to a more mundane subject , namely transportation to and from the grounds of the 12 world cup venues , siemens also has much at stake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup mascot goleo is n't the only one who wants smooth train service the company developed the " ruhrpilot " project , named after the ruhr river metropolitan region that extends for 116 kilometers -lrb- 72 mile -rrb- in the heart of north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- .
winter said that ruhrpilot is a computer-supported system that will make sure there is " intelligent traffic management between cars , busses and trains " so that fans and residents do n't have to suffer needlessly before , during and after matches at nrw 's venues in dortmund , gelsenkirchen and cologne . such " complete solutions from one mold , " as project leader thomas brodocz called it , is a result of years of experience .
siemens coordinated the infrastructure projects for the 2004 athens olympics and has won the contracts for the peking games as well as the next world cup in south africa . klaus ulrich -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from soccer yard to world-class stadium the houses of the soccer gods will be ready when fans fall to their knees at missed penalty kicks and cheer in exultation for newly-won fame , according to world cup organizing committee vice-chairman wolfgang niersbach .

his statements came ahead of a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five permanent un security council members plus germany -lrb- as member of the so-called eu-3 delegation negotiating with iran -rrb- aimed at agreeing to a joint policy on how to deal with tehran 's nuclear ambitions . straw said the negotiators would decide at a monday meeting in london what kind of resolution to put to the un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which meets feb .
2 to discuss iran 's breach of non-proliferation obligations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " we are trying to persuade iran to come back into compliance .
there is some intense diplomacy taking place over this weekend , " straw told reuters television early saturday .
a decision to ask the iaea to refer iran to the security council would be made in light of discussions on monday , straw said . applying pressure if it is the consensus of all those present at the monday meeting , straw said " the chances of iran avoiding a reference are low . "
the foreign secretary said he would " much prefer to resolve the issue within the iaea , " but the iaea statutes make clear that when an issue ca n't be resolved and when a nation is found non-compliant , the matter has to be directed to the security council . and iran is " very clearly " not complying , straw said , pointing to tehran 's decision to break iaea seals and resume sensitive atomic fuel research earlier this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier upping the pressure on iran to cooperate , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who will also participate in the talks , said all options needed to be kept open , including levying economic sanctions if iran refuses to cooperate .
speaking to the news magazine spiegel , steinmeier said it would not be prudent to exclude economic sanctions .
" iran should not underestimate to what extent it is dependent on technical and economic cooperation with the west , " he said . breaking the deadlock britain , france and germany – the eu-3 – have been involved in negotiations with iran for over a year , with little sign of progress .
offers to iran of financial and technical know-how in exchange for stopping sensitive research on the enrichment of uranium – one of the first steps for developing atomic weapons – were pushed on and off again by the islamic republic , which claims its nuclear program is strictly civilian in nature . when iran broke the un seals on its nuclear facilities at the beginning of the month and announced it would proceed with plans as intended , the eu trio said talks had reached a " dead end . "
but since then the three have revised their position and together with washington have stressed that diplomacy remains the best way to resolve the dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in south iran .
it is now up to iran to get the ball rolling again if it wants to avoid a security council referral .
" what we have said is that they have to provide objective guarantees that the nuclear capability is solely for civil nuclear power purposes , " straw reiterated in davos . " what we want to see is them coming forward and then we can get to a normalization with plenty of incentives and all the rest , " the british official said . russian proposal a proposal put forth by moscow to allow iran to follow through with uranium enrichment activity on russian soil as a means of quelling the dispute , has generated a good deal of interest .
the iranians , who wish to continue with the sensitive enrichment but have been prevented from doing so by international regulations , could do so across the border , where they would come under russian supervision . mohammed el baradei , head of iaea , referred to the russian proposal as an " attractive offer " that warranted consideration .
jack straw was cautiously optimistic about russia 's role in the nuclear dispute .
" russia plays an active role in finding a solution , which we could possibly support , " he said saturday .

al aynsley-green told bbc news other parts of tony blair 's " respect " agenda may also be at odds with the un convention on the rights of the child .
it was right to talk about respect but punishing and controlling children was not necessarily the answer , he said .
he also voiced fears that new licensing laws added to " conflicting messages " to children about alcohol .
commissioner 's priorities make sure children and young people are valued tackle " demonisation " of children in the media campaign for total ban on smacking tackle bullying work to prevent children being " exploited " by advertisers support principles of the un convention on the rights of the child guidelines issued last year said adults and children as young as 10 handed anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- should be " named and shamed " in the media and leaflets as a matter of course .
home secretary charles clarke said many offenders thought they were " untouchable " and needed to be shown there would be no " news blackout " on their actions .
the government also says the action can reassure people that nuisance behaviour is being tackled .
the courts can also lift the usual ban on identifying youths where they are convicted of serious offences .
promises professor aynsley-green , england 's first children 's commissioner , points to the un convention which protects children 's privacy .
" i 'm concerned about the naming and shaming of people .
i think this is an abuse of their rights to privacy , " he said .
discussion on the issue so far had been very one-sided , he argued .
" i am asking for a mature debate in the light of what the government has signed up to - to give promises to children of protection , provision and participation by signing up to the un convention on the rights of the child . "
prof aynsley-green is echoing fears expressed by children 's charity barnado 's and by the children 's commissioner in wales .
he said he did not totally oppose asbos , which could help some people see the error of their ways .
but he was worried when they were given to children who could not understand them because of behavioural problems or learning difficulties .
he has urged magistrates to understand the background of each child before using an asbo as a last resort .
the commissioner also appears worried about another weapon in the armoury against nuisance behaviour : dispersal orders , which can be used to stop groups of youths congregating .
" is it right for children who are gathering on street corners , who are committing no crime , to be punished for that ? , " he asks .
' bunker thinking ' the professor is disappointed there is no mention of the un convention on children 's rights in the government 's " respect action plan " , unveiled earlier this month .
instead , the principles of the convention should " overlay " the action plan , he argued .
prof aynsley-green said tony blair had been right to raise the issue of respect and he welcomed government promises to regenerate depressed areas . "
i have despair from seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives " al aynsley-green children 's commissioner but he worried the debate was becoming " a bit bunkered in its thinking " .
" this issue of respect is an incredibly complicated agenda .
there is no quick fix , there is no one-size-fits-all and i do not think punishment and control is necessarily the answer to this . "
he highlighted the links between nuisance behaviour and drink and drugs .
and he warned : " we give children very conflicting messages about alcohol : on the one hand extending the licensing hours , on the other hand not seeing how targeted young people are by the alcohol industry . "
' despair ' the commissioner was appointed last july and is still camped out in a temporary office inside the department for education and skills .
he was previously national clinical director for children and a child health professor at london 's great ormond street hospital .
his first few months have seen him touring the country talking to young people in schools , prisons , detention centres and rough-sleeping beneath railway arches .
he reportedly has also been watching the dick and dom show and listening to franz ferdinand cds to help get a grip on youth culture .
he even donned a " hoodie " in one speech aimed at highlighting how the media too often perpetuate negative stereotypes of young people .
it has all filled him with a mixture of " exhilaration , despair and fright " .
he is excited by the " wonderful children " he has met and determined that all his work will be embedded in what children tell him .
" i have got a fairly shrewd idea of what it 's like to be a child and therein lies my despair ... seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives and the way in which the majority of the population in this country appear to be oblivious to the difficulties they are facing . "
his fear come from the expectation on his office to tackle the problems of 11.8m children .
smacking plea among his concerns are the " relentless pressure " put on children by the advertising industry .
he wants the government seriously to consider giving lowering the voting age from 16 to 17 .
and he joined with his counterparts in wales , scotland and northern ireland to urge a total ban on smacking - as there is in 20 other countries .
he said he was not surprised the government rebuffed their demand but said there was " inexorable momentum towards support for this argument " .
" children are the only people in england at the moment who legally can be assaulted ... , " said professor aynsley-green .
" we are not saying that children should not be disciplined , far from it , but we are anxious to promote positive approaches to disciplining children . "
top of children 's concerns , however , is bullying and the commissioner has just published a booklet aimed at giving children advice on the subject .
he is also pushing an idea which came from children : for all school pupils to fill in questionnaires on bullying every term which can be assessed by school inspectors .
with a political storm brewing over school reform plans , the commissioner is keen to engage children in the debate .
and in his role as the official voice for children , he poses an " exam question " for everybody to ponder : " what is it actually like to be a child or young person today , particularly one that is at the margins ? "

home secretary charles clarke said many offenders thought they were " untouchable " and needed to be shown there would be no " news blackout " on their actions .
the government also says the action can reassure people that nuisance behaviour is being tackled .
the courts can also lift the usual ban on identifying youths where they are convicted of serious offences .
promises professor aynsley-green , england 's first children 's commissioner , points to the un convention which protects children 's privacy .
" i 'm concerned about the naming and shaming of people .
i think this is an abuse of their rights to privacy , " he said .
discussion on the issue so far had been very one-sided , he argued .
ministers are refusing to impose a full smacking ban " i am asking for a mature debate in the light of what the government has signed up to - to give promises to children of protection , provision and participation by signing up to the un convention on the rights of the child . "
prof aynsley-green is echoing fears expressed by children 's charity barnado 's and by the children 's commissioner in wales .
he said he did not totally oppose asbos , which could help some people see the error of their ways .
but he was worried when they were given to children who could not understand them because of behavioural problems or learning difficulties .
he has urged magistrates to understand the background of each child before using an asbo as a last resort .
the commissioner also appears worried about another weapon in the armoury against nuisance behaviour : dispersal orders , which can be used to stop groups of youths congregating .
" is it right for children who are gathering on street corners , who are committing no crime , to be punished for that ? , " he asks .
' bunker thinking ' the professor is disappointed there is no mention of the un convention on children 's rights in the government 's " respect action plan " , unveiled earlier this month .
instead , the principles of the convention should " overlay " the action plan , he argued .
prof aynsley-green said tony blair had been right to raise the issue of respect and he welcomed government promises to regenerate depressed areas .
i have despair from seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives al aynsley-green children 's commissioner but he worried the debate was becoming " a bit bunkered in its thinking " .
" this issue of respect is an incredibly complicated agenda .
there is no quick fix , there is no one-size-fits-all and i do not think punishment and control is necessarily the answer to this . "
he highlighted the links between nuisance behaviour and drink and drugs .
and he warned : " we give children very conflicting messages about alcohol : on the one hand extending the licensing hours , on the other hand not seeing how targeted young people are by the alcohol industry . "
' despair ' the commissioner was appointed last july and is still camped out in a temporary office inside the department for education and skills .
he was previously national clinical director for children and a child health professor at london 's great ormond street hospital .
his first few months have seen him touring the country talking to young people in schools , prisons , detention centres and rough-sleeping beneath railway arches .
the watchdog is trying to fight stereotypes of young people he reportedly has also been watching the dick and dom show and listening to franz ferdinand cds to help get a grip on youth culture .
he even donned a " hoodie " in one speech aimed at highlighting how the media too often perpetuate negative stereotypes of young people .
it has all filled him with a mixture of " exhilaration , despair and fright " .
he is excited by the " wonderful children " he has met and determined that all his work will be embedded in what children tell him .
" i have got a fairly shrewd idea of what it 's like to be a child and therein lies my despair ... seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives and the way in which the majority of the population in this country appear to be oblivious to the difficulties they are facing . "
his fear come from the expectation on his office to tackle the problems of 11.8m children .
smacking plea among his concerns are the " relentless pressure " put on children by the advertising industry .
he wants the government seriously to consider giving lowering the voting age from 16 to 17 .
and he joined with his counterparts in wales , scotland and northern ireland to urge a total ban on smacking - as there is in 20 other countries .
he said he was not surprised the government rebuffed their demand but said there was " inexorable momentum towards support for this argument " .
" children are the only people in england at the moment who legally can be assaulted ... , " said professor aynsley-green .
" we are not saying that children should not be disciplined , far from it , but we are anxious to promote positive approaches to disciplining children . "
top of children 's concerns , however , is bullying and the commissioner has just published a booklet aimed at giving children advice on the subject .
he is also pushing an idea which came from children : for all school pupils to fill in questionnaires on bullying every term which can be assessed by school inspectors .
with a political storm brewing over school reform plans , the commissioner is keen to engage children in the debate .
and in his role as the official voice for children , he poses an " exam question " for everybody to ponder : " what is it actually like to be a child or young person today , particularly one that is at the margins ? "

al aynsley-green told bbc news other parts of tony blair 's " respect " agenda may also be at odds with the un convention on the rights of the child .
it was right to talk about respect but punishing and controlling children was not necessarily the answer , he said .
he also voiced fears that new licensing laws added to " conflicting messages " to children about alcohol .
commissioner 's priorities make sure children and young people are valued tackle " demonisation " of children in the media campaign for total ban on smacking tackle bullying work to prevent children being " exploited " by advertisers support principles of the un convention on the rights of the child guidelines issued last year said adults and children as young as 10 handed anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- should be " named and shamed " in the media and leaflets as a matter of course .
home secretary charles clarke said many offenders thought they were " untouchable " and needed to be shown there would be no " news blackout " on their actions .
the government also says the action can reassure people that nuisance behaviour is being tackled .
the courts can also lift the usual ban on identifying youths where they are convicted of serious offences .
promises professor aynsley-green , england 's first children 's commissioner , points to the un convention which protects children 's privacy .
" i 'm concerned about the naming and shaming of people .
i think this is an abuse of their rights to privacy , " he said .
discussion on the issue so far had been very one-sided , he argued .
ministers are refusing to impose a full smacking ban " i am asking for a mature debate in the light of what the government has signed up to - to give promises to children of protection , provision and participation by signing up to the un convention on the rights of the child . "
prof aynsley-green is echoing fears expressed by children 's charity barnado 's and by the children 's commissioner in wales .
he said he did not totally oppose asbos , which could help some people see the error of their ways .
but he was worried when they were given to children who could not understand them because of behavioural problems or learning difficulties .
he has urged magistrates to understand the background of each child before using an asbo as a last resort .
the commissioner also appears worried about another weapon in the armoury against nuisance behaviour : dispersal orders , which can be used to stop groups of youths congregating .
" is it right for children who are gathering on street corners , who are committing no crime , to be punished for that ? , " he asks .
' bunker thinking ' the professor is disappointed there is no mention of the un convention on children 's rights in the government 's " respect action plan " , unveiled earlier this month .
instead , the principles of the convention should " overlay " the action plan , he argued .
prof aynsley-green said tony blair had been right to raise the issue of respect and he welcomed government promises to regenerate depressed areas .
i have despair from seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives al aynsley-green children 's commissioner but he worried the debate was becoming " a bit bunkered in its thinking " .
" this issue of respect is an incredibly complicated agenda .
there is no quick fix , there is no one-size-fits-all and i do not think punishment and control is necessarily the answer to this . "
he highlighted the links between nuisance behaviour and drink and drugs .
and he warned : " we give children very conflicting messages about alcohol : on the one hand extending the licensing hours , on the other hand not seeing how targeted young people are by the alcohol industry . "
' despair ' the commissioner was appointed last july and is still camped out in a temporary office inside the department for education and skills .
he was previously national clinical director for children and a child health professor at london 's great ormond street hospital .
his first few months have seen him touring the country talking to young people in schools , prisons , detention centres and rough-sleeping beneath railway arches .
the watchdog is trying to fight stereotypes of young people he reportedly has also been watching the dick and dom show and listening to franz ferdinand cds to help get a grip on youth culture .
he even donned a " hoodie " in one speech aimed at highlighting how the media too often perpetuate negative stereotypes of young people .
it has all filled him with a mixture of " exhilaration , despair and fright " .
he is excited by the " wonderful children " he has met and determined that all his work will be embedded in what children tell him .
" i have got a fairly shrewd idea of what it 's like to be a child and therein lies my despair ... seeing the sheer awfulness of many children 's lives and the way in which the majority of the population in this country appear to be oblivious to the difficulties they are facing . "
his fear come from the expectation on his office to tackle the problems of 11.8m children .
smacking plea among his concerns are the " relentless pressure " put on children by the advertising industry .
he wants the government seriously to consider giving lowering the voting age from 16 to 17 .

that autumnal scene is caused by bracken on the moorland slopes which have died back and changed colour from green to a light chestnut .
it is a scene which has enchanted winter visitors to the uplands of our national parks for generations .
however , it is not the timeless vision it appears to be .
one hundred years ago many of these same scenes would have been far more varied in their colours .
bracken now takes up far more space than ever before .
the reason is because of the changes in the way we use the moorland according to rhodri thomas , environmental manager of the peak district national park .
" bracken is an invasive fern that spreads underground through its roots , " he tells the politics show for yorkshire and lincolnshire .
" in the past cattle and horses would tread it down and break up the roots .
" today it is mostly sheep grazing up here and they have no effect on controlling the spread of bracken . "
sheep grazing does not stop the spread of bracken once it takes hold bracken kills off other species which can not compete for the same space .
the biggest worry is heather .

" we can control it through chemicals dropped from the air by helicopter but it is a costly process . "
liberal democrat peer lord tony greaves , who lives in the south pennines himself , is concerned about the growth of bracken .
he says it needs to be tackled and its area reduced .
as his party 's environment spokesman in the house of lords he is calling for government aid for landowners and organisations like the national parks and the national trust to do the work .
however rhodri thomas urges caution as he looked out of the vast expanse of bracken on the slopes below stanidge edge straddling the border of yorkshire and derbyshire .
" it is a native plant and it provides valuable wildlife habitat in many circumstances .
" it also provides a back drop to our moorland areas than many people have come expect . "

that autumnal scene is caused by bracken on the moorland slopes which have died back and changed colour from green to a light chestnut .
it is a scene which has enchanted winter visitors to the uplands of our national parks for generations .
however , it is not the timeless vision it appears to be .
one hundred years ago many of these same scenes would have been far more varied in their colours .
bracken now takes up far more space than ever before .
the reason is because of the changes in the way we use the moorland according to rhodri thomas , environmental manager of the peak district national park .
" bracken is an invasive fern that spreads underground through its roots , " he tells the politics show for yorkshire and lincolnshire .
" in the past cattle and horses would tread it down and break up the roots .
" today it is mostly sheep grazing up here and they have no effect on controlling the spread of bracken . "
sheep grazing does not stop the spread of bracken once it takes hold bracken kills off other species which can not compete for the same space .
the biggest worry is heather .
" three quarters of all the upland flowering heather in europe grows on the uk 's moorlands so we have to be careful that the bracken does not push it out , " says rhodri thomas .
" we can control it through chemicals dropped from the air by helicopter but it is a costly process . "
liberal democrat peer lord tony greaves , who lives in the south pennines himself , is concerned about the growth of bracken .

progress on the complex near bridgend halted last july amid problems over sewerage plans , and bad weather means work will not resume fully until march .
but lord attenborough said companies were keen to cut costs in wales .
he said : " people are coming to me saying ' when , when , when ? " ' .
lord attenborough , the 83-year-old oscar-winning actor and director , was at the pop factory media complex in porth , rhondda , on friday night to re-launch the rhondda cynon taf business club .
he told the invited audience how the dragon scheme , dubbed valleywood , would " build studios that have not been seen for decades throughout the world " .
if you say to somebody , come here to south wales , you can have all these open spaces , you can breathe clean air , it 's very seductive lord attenborough the development began construction in earnest last july after five years of planning .
organisers say the 12 state-of-the art sound stages and tv studios will make south wales a centre of the uk film industry .
but within days of lord attenborough posing for the cameras as the bulldozers moved on to the site of a former opencast mine , work ground to halt while the necessary permits for sewerage work were gained .
' agony of london ' on friday , he and business partner stuart villard explained that the delay had taken until last october to resolve , by which time the building work was hit by bad weather .
they said work would not start again entirely until march , with completion of the first two film studios set for the late summer .
the 12-studio complex will offer filmmakers a new location lord attenborough said film production companies continued to find the idea of moving their projects out of london to south wales " very seductive " .
he said : " working within the m25 is really costly now .
" the costs in london are horrendous .
the costs -lsb- in wales -rsb- are much lower .
" but it 's not only the costs -lsb- of london -rsb- , it 's the conditions , the agony of moving around , the misery of getting anywhere .
" if you say to somebody , come here to south wales , you can have all these open spaces , you can breathe clean air , it 's very seductive . "
dormice mr villard said the first two studios to be finished would be 20,000 sq ft and 10,000 sq ft .
he added : " we could let 10 stages right now , and that 's no exaggeration . "
the project 's website claims film makers can save up to 25 % on their multi-million-pound budgets by switching their operation from london to south wales .
the valleywood complex aims to bring 12 studios , including one of 30,000 sq ft and two of 20,000 sq ft to provide facilities for recording anything from a quiz show to a big screen blockbuster .
a new motorway junction is included to provide access from the m4 .
construction work had previously been held up for four months while investigations ensured the development would not harm any of the dormice population .

progress on the complex near bridgend halted last july amid problems over sewerage plans , and bad weather means work will not resume fully until march .
but lord attenborough said companies were keen to cut costs in wales .
he said : " people are coming to me saying ' when , when , when ? " ' .
lord attenborough , the 83-year-old oscar-winning actor and director , was at the pop factory media complex in porth , rhondda , on friday night to re-launch the rhondda cynon taf business club .
he told the invited audience how the dragon scheme , dubbed valleywood , would " build studios that have not been seen for decades throughout the world " .
if you say to somebody , come here to south wales , you can have all these open spaces , you can breathe clean air , it 's very seductive lord attenborough the development began construction in earnest last july after five years of planning .
organisers say the 12 state-of-the art sound stages and tv studios will make south wales a centre of the uk film industry .
but within days of lord attenborough posing for the cameras as the bulldozers moved on to the site of a former opencast mine , work ground to halt while the necessary permits for sewerage work were gained .
' agony of london ' on friday , he and business partner stuart villard explained that the delay had taken until last october to resolve , by which time the building work was hit by bad weather .
they said work would not start again entirely until march , with completion of the first two film studios set for the late summer .
the 12-studio complex will offer filmmakers a new location lord attenborough said film production companies continued to find the idea of moving their projects out of london to south wales " very seductive " .
he said : " working within the m25 is really costly now .
" the costs in london are horrendous .
the costs -lsb- in wales -rsb- are much lower .
" but it 's not only the costs -lsb- of london -rsb- , it 's the conditions , the agony of moving around , the misery of getting anywhere .
" if you say to somebody , come here to south wales , you can have all these open spaces , you can breathe clean air , it 's very seductive . "
dormice mr villard said the first two studios to be finished would be 20,000 sq ft and 10,000 sq ft .
he added : " we could let 10 stages right now , and that 's no exaggeration . "
the project 's website claims film makers can save up to 25 % on their multi-million-pound budgets by switching their operation from london to south wales .
the valleywood complex aims to bring 12 studios , including one of 30,000 sq ft and two of 20,000 sq ft to provide facilities for recording anything from a quiz show to a big screen blockbuster .
a new motorway junction is included to provide access from the m4 .
construction work had previously been held up for four months while investigations ensured the development would not harm any of the dormice population .
