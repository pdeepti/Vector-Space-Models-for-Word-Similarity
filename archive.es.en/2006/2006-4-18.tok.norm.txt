many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks to justify a crackdown on immigrants .
" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .
in this respect , we must move away from the catch-all policy where everyone is a threat to one of selective opening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world . " allowing in only ' useful ' immigrants helps no one human rights activists and development agencies believe this view to be outdated .
" we must prevent the ' brain drain ' from these developing nations , " said günter bonnet of germany ’ s economic development ministry .
" if we don ’ t stop the elite from leaving these countries , they will become a wasteland and will not be able to save themselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .
" we live in the time of globalization and the liberalization of markets and it is quite normal that people move around , not just from poorer nations . " " europeans have to learn to see immigrants not as a menace but as a chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer .

other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .
" this is for me an isolated incident , unlike anything i have seen before in all the years i have been on the job . " attack has changed potsdam 's atmosphere according to potsdam 's mayor jan jakobs , the " despicable " attack has changed the city .

he is married to a german woman and has two children .
he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver . " when the taxi driver saw the victim hit the ground , he approached the scene and got out of his taxi , then moved towards the apparent assailants , who then fled the scene of the crime , " welfens said .
" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.04.2006 eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boat is full according to many eu politicians , but migration experts beg to differ rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good . more than 64 million people from poorer countries have found a new home in the eu .
many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks to justify a crackdown on immigrants .
" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .
in this respect , we must move away from the catch-all policy where everyone is a threat to one of selective opening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world . " allowing in only ' useful ' immigrants helps no one human rights activists and development agencies believe this view to be outdated .
" we must prevent the ' brain drain ' from these developing nations , " said günter bonnet of germany ’ s economic development ministry .
" if we don ’ t stop the elite from leaving these countries , they will become a wasteland and will not be able to save themselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .
" we live in the time of globalization and the liberalization of markets and it is quite normal that people move around , not just from poorer nations . " " europeans have to learn to see immigrants not as a menace but as a chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2006 women 's challenging climb to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are a career and a family compatible ?
women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks to justify a crackdown on immigrants .
" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .
in this respect , we must move away from the catch-all policy where everyone is a threat to one of selective opening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world . " allowing in only ' useful ' immigrants helps no one human rights activists and development agencies believe this view to be outdated .
" we must prevent the ' brain drain ' from these developing nations , " said günter bonnet of germany ’ s economic development ministry .
" if we don ’ t stop the elite from leaving these countries , they will become a wasteland and will not be able to save themselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .
" we live in the time of globalization and the liberalization of markets and it is quite normal that people move around , not just from poorer nations . " " europeans have to learn to see immigrants not as a menace but as a chance .

just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .

" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries .

" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .

the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german man close to death after racist attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brutal atttack took place at this tram stop in potsdam a german man of east african origin is fighting for his life after being brutally beaten up .
but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .
" this is for me an isolated incident , unlike anything i have seen before in all the years i have been on the job . " attack has changed potsdam 's atmosphere according to potsdam 's mayor jan jakobs , the " despicable " attack has changed the city . " something like this ca n't help but change the atmosphere of a city , " jakobs said .
" until now , people had the feeling they could walk freely on the streets , and i know from lots of people who have come here from other countries that they enjoy living here .
what happened today could make finding that feeling a bit more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm wants to see the assailants punished he said he was " highly unsettled " by the attack 's brutality . brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm said there would be strong penalties for the crime . " in this country we do not tolerate that extremists chase , beat up or even murder people because of their skin color , religion or political positions , " schönbohm said at a press conference on monday . courageous taxi driver saved victim the victim was born in addis ababa , but has had german citizenship for several years .
he is married to a german woman and has two children .
he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver . " when the taxi driver saw the victim hit the ground , he approached the scene and got out of his taxi , then moved towards the apparent assailants , who then fled the scene of the crime , " welfens said .
" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .
one wore a black bomber jacket with a white logo , and one of them may have been a woman - a theory that prosecutors also share , after hearing the high pitch of one of the voices on the recording . potsdamers show their solidarity the victim is in the hospital , with severe injuries to his skull and ribs .
doctors have placed him in an artificial coma to relieve swelling on the brain .
his condition is being described as stable , but critical . prosecutors in potsdam have offered a 5,000-euro -lrb- $ 6,113 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers . on monday night , protesters took to the streets in a show of solidarity with the victim - and to demonstrate that racist violence will not be tolerated . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2006 women 's challenging climb to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are a career and a family compatible ?
women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .

equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2006 women 's challenging climb to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are a career and a family compatible ?
women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .

it may be international women 's day , but how far have women come in the battle for equality of the sexes ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children were particularly hit by the high levels of radioactivity in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries .

in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .

the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured .

" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children were particularly hit by the high levels of radioactivity in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .

although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .

although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .

in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .

health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .

in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .

he is married to a german woman and has two children .
he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver .

" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .
" this is for me an isolated incident , unlike anything i have seen before in all the years i have been on the job .

he is married to a german woman and has two children .
he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver .

" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.04.2006 eu must change its immigration policy , experts warn großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boat is full according to many eu politicians , but migration experts beg to differ rather than building the walls around " fortress europe " higher , as many eu politicians favor , migration experts say the eu needs a new progressive policy on immigration - for its own good . more than 64 million people from poorer countries have found a new home in the eu .
many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks to justify a crackdown on immigrants .
" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .
in this respect , we must move away from the catch-all policy where everyone is a threat to one of selective opening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world . " allowing in only ' useful ' immigrants helps no one human rights activists and development agencies believe this view to be outdated .
" we must prevent the ' brain drain ' from these developing nations , " said günter bonnet of germany ’ s economic development ministry .
" if we don ’ t stop the elite from leaving these countries , they will become a wasteland and will not be able to save themselves . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .
" we live in the time of globalization and the liberalization of markets and it is quite normal that people move around , not just from poorer nations . " " europeans have to learn to see immigrants not as a menace but as a chance .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2006 women 's challenging climb to the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are a career and a family compatible ?
women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .
even if there 's still a long way to go until women have reached a quota in top management in germany where one could talk of equality . ulrike hummel -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general has people wondering if things are changing for women .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : women on top ?
it may be international women 's day , but how far have women come in the battle for equality of the sexes ?

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .

" no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .

" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?

the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .
the connection to radiation in individual cases could not be proven , but the figures suggested this suspicion . greenpeace called for a worldwide phasing out of nuclear energy . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks to justify a crackdown on immigrants .
" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .
in this respect , we must move away from the catch-all policy where everyone is a threat to one of selective opening . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .
it does not orientate itself primarily on economic demands . pagel said people often forget that diversity - also an employee 's sex - can have business-related effects , as clients are just as diverse . " for this reason , one should develop products , processes and measures to serve these clients ' demands , " pagel said .
yet companies still had quite a bit of awareness raising ahead of them . many successful and mainly multinational companies have increasingly put the question of sex and diversity on their agenda in the past few years .
last but not least because there is a lack of qualified specialists and managers in many sectors . but also given demographic developments , which will lead to a labor shortage in the medium-term : women are considered the " intelligence reserve " without whom nothing will work in the future .
that gives hope .

women in europe are generally better educated than men , but hold fewer top positions .
germany is no exception .
just why is the fairer sex excluded from the echelons of power ? men are virtually on their own in germany 's executive offices .
according to a current study by the eu statistics office eurostat , women only hold 10.4 percent of the top positions in the german business world . the share of women in leading management has more than doubled in the past decade .
yet that glass ceiling - which invisibly but effectively hinders women 's rise to the top - continues to be present . telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , for example , has increased its share of women in overall leading positions to 17.5 percent .
but women are significantly underrepresented in top management , said maud pagel , deutsche telekom 's representative for equal opportunities and diversity .
on that level , the quota of women is only four percent . of the german companies listed on the stock market index dax , not one has a female management board member . " the obstacle is the myth " there are various reasons for this development .
in germany , in particular , it is consistently argued that a career and a family do n't go well together .
often , however , the argument is itself the reason . " the obstacle is the myth , which says that both areas are not compatible , " said andrea löther from bonn 's center of excellence women and science .
this means that when senior staff believes that a career and a family do n't mix , then they will support women less than men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many men would also like to change their role as breadwinner in the course of the political correctness movement , it has been repeatedly stressed how important women in leading positions are in the business world .
in practice , though , the traditional thought patterns often still prevail , although studies have shown that young men also want to get away from this role of being the breadwinner , pagel said . " women maybe have to learn something , too : to have more guts to say that they want top positions , " pagel said . diversity is the key professional expertise and determination alone are not enough to increase the number of women in top positions , though .
in the 1990s , measures to promote women focused on the compatibility of career and family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom wants more diversity among its staff today , companies are waging more on qualification and personnel development .
equal opportunity here is also essential for deutsche telekom , pagel said .
diversity is the key in personnel strategies : differences in sex , age , religion , lifestyle and social class are considered the factors for success - economically , too . today , work-life balance and diversity are the key topics in personnel policies for many companies .
in the united states , studies have shown that those companies which employ women in top positions , thus fulfilling the diversity aspect , are more profitable . eu favors gender management the model favored by the european union for equal opportunity personnel policies is gender management .
it is mainly aimed at equal opportunities for women and men as a societal task .

many eu politicians have said enough is enough and are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep any more immigrants crossing the borders into europe . however , while many continue to risk their lives to get into the eu and as the borders of " fortress europe " become increasingly difficult to scale , some experts are proposing a " selective opening " approach to dealing with the influx of immigrants . migration is currently seen as a security problem by most governments , according to thomas faist , a migration expert at the university of bielefeld .
he says that for a change in approach to be successful , that perception has to change .
" migration is a sociopolitical problem ; and it is an economic problem , " faist said . he has criticized those eu politicians who have used the sept .

" the terrorists of 9/11 were well integrated , mobile people not typical migrants .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those perceived as useful are let in how would such a policy work and how would progressive migration experts convince the heads of state to at least consider it ?
most eu leaders follow the same thinking as the french interior minister nicolas sarkozy who says : " we don ’ t want any destitute immigrants , but only those who are especially equipped to contribute in significant and lasting ways to the development of france in the world . " allowing in only ' useful ' immigrants helps no one human rights activists and development agencies believe this view to be outdated .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans fear an influx of immigrants besides , a small hand-picked group of highly qualified immigrants can not solve one of the biggest problems in the eu - namely that the population of europe is rapidly ageing . by 2015 , a third of the people in europe will be older than 50 .
the future of europe depends on immigration .
migration experts already warn about future competition within the eu for immigrants if policies are not changed now . nevertheless , many europeans are afraid that migrants will take work away from them .
these fears are valid and should be taken seriously , says ulla mikota of the federation for third world aid policy of german non-governmental organizations . europe should see the benefits if migration , say experts however , she said , the eu should be realistic .
" the threat is not about workplaces because many illegal immigrants are unable to get work , " she said .
" there are many more illegal immigrants living on benefits than on earnings from work . " mikota demands that eu politicians create more possibilities for people from other continents to immigrate legally into the eu .
" we live in the time of globalization and the liberalization of markets and it is quite normal that people move around , not just from poorer nations .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .

he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .

he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver . " when the taxi driver saw the victim hit the ground , he approached the scene and got out of his taxi , then moved towards the apparent assailants , who then fled the scene of the crime , " welfens said .
" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .
one wore a black bomber jacket with a white logo , and one of them may have been a woman - a theory that prosecutors also share , after hearing the high pitch of one of the voices on the recording . potsdamers show their solidarity the victim is in the hospital , with severe injuries to his skull and ribs .
doctors have placed him in an artificial coma to relieve swelling on the brain .
his condition is being described as stable , but critical . prosecutors in potsdam have offered a 5,000-euro -lrb- $ 6,113 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers . on monday night , protesters took to the streets in a show of solidarity with the victim - and to demonstrate that racist violence will not be tolerated . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .

but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .

but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer . " whoever claims that there were 4,000 victims is denying the gravity of this disaster and ignoring the suffering of countless people , " breuer said . official figures painted too harmless a picture in a report greenpeace released in berlin , kiev and amsterdam on tuesday , the organization did not disclose casualty figures , which it said was not possible , as the health consequences would not be able to be assessed for a long time yet .
however , greenpeace said the figures cited by the chernobyl forum painted too harmless a picture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extent of the chernobyl accident only became clear days later the greenpeace report integrates many studies not considered in the west , including ones from the russian-speaking world .
the report shows that the radiation exposure from the catastrophe on april 26 , 1986 caused a very wide spectrum of illnesses . according to greenpeace , there is a lot of information on the frequency of illnesses , in particular cancer .
the iaea figures represented the lower end of these estimations , the group said . the latest studies by the russian academy of sciences on the countries belarus , ukraine and russia estimate 270,000 additional cases of cancer , of which 93,000 are likely to end in death .
other studies assumed even worse consequences . the figures " do n't add up " greenpeace is not alone in doubting the official figures .
radiobiologist edmund lengfelder from the university of munich estimated the number of dead " liquidators " - technicians and rescue workers , who cleaned up and safeguarded the area after the explosion - at 50,000 to 100,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chernobyl 's liquidators were the hardest hit " the figures declared by world authorities do n't add up from start to finish , " lengfelder said .
the organization international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war also estimates casualty figures of this magnitude . " even the iaea assumes in its estimates more deaths than it publicly states , " said greenpeace 's breuer .
" you just have to read the fine print in its study .
what the authority does there is consciously playing down the worst nuclear accident ever . " this provided the nuclear industry with figures more suited to their sector and the over 440 nuclear power plants worldwide , breuer said . radiation sparked other illnesses , too for illnesses besides cancer , the greenpeace study showed a rise in cases in affected areas in comparison to other regions . it was assumed the radioactivity attacked people 's immune systems and also changed their genetic make-up , the group said .

the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said . the health consequences of the chernobyl reactor catastrophe 20 years ago are much more extensive than initially assumed , according to environmental group greenpeace . " no can say for certain how many people will die as a result of chernobyl , " said greenpeace 's nuclear expert thomas breuer .
" the effects of the radioactivity are too manifold and the data is insufficient . " the chernobyl forum - a group of specialists , including representatives of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- - last september presented a report on the health effects of the chernobyl accident which concluded that 4,000 - 9,000 people died , or will die , from radiogenic cancer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on health german bio boom shows organic shopping no flash in the pan germany still lighting up study shows germans getting heavier striking german doctors shed light on system ills germany -pipe- 18.04.2006 german health system not quite in intensive care großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite financial stresses on the system , the quality of german medical care remains high going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture . in a 2000 report conducted by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- on global health care , germany ranked 25th out of 191 countries based on a cost-effectiveness ratio , coming in before the usa -lrb- 37 -rrb- and canada -lrb- 30 -rrb- .
in another study , carried out by the frank beske institute for health system research in 2005 , germany came in first among 14 industrial countries regarding health-care services available to the insured . part of the reason for that is the dense network of doctors , dentists , hospitals and private practices around the country .
according to who statistics , germany has around 358 doctors per 100,000 inhabitants , well ahead of the us , with 279 and canada , with 229 .
health-care coverage , while not universal , comes close . but ask germans about their own system and they are usually quick to judge it wanting .
one survey conducted by the commonwealth fund , an american health care foundation , found that 55 percent of germans thought the system needed fundamental reform . americans on the other hand , 15 percent of whom are uninsured and who have a health-care system widely seen as both inefficient and expensive , rate the system better .
more than 50 percent of americans rate the us health-care system as " excellent " ; only 35 percent of germans would give their own system such high marks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospital consultation with doctors in hamburg " we complain a lot about a very good system of health care , " said volker bahr of the fritz beske institute for health system research , whose institute put together the comparative report on health care in 14 western countries . " if i had a fantastic insurance plan and economic means in the us , then i would have fantastic treatment , " he added .
" but when it comes to the average joe , he 's often better taken care of in germany . " the institute 's report found that " as demonstrated in international comparisons , germany has a comprehensive , inexpensive system with an above-average efficiency rating . " others take a slightly less rosy view , pointing to the fact that germany 's system is costly .
in a global comparison , the country spends more on health care than any other country besides the united states and switzerland . " the quality in germany is not bad at all , even though in looking at the costs , it might be better , " said boris augurzky , head of the health care department at the rhineland-westphalia institute for economic research .
" still , germans almost never have to put up with long waiting times for treatment like they do in england or scandinavia . " but media reports often paint a different picture , depicting a system that is ailing , past its prime and teetering toward collapse .
health-care reforms enacted over the past several years , which introduced a nominal co-pay for doctor 's office visits and made some changes to drugs covered by public health plans , have unleashed widespread anger among the populace and only deepened public dissatisfaction with a system that statistics and health-care professionals say is still one of the best . weak points that is not to say that the country 's health-care system does not have its problems , particularly when it comes to long-term financing .
right now , the system is supported for by contributions from workers , who generally pay around 14 percent of their wages for health care .
but germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rates have meant less money is going into the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a higher concentration of hospitals and doctors than other countries on monday , the president of one of germany 's leading doctors ' organizations , the bundesärztekammer , warned that germany could be on its way to emulating the united states when it comes to medical care for the poor .
the number of people without medical insurance in germany has risen above the 200,000 mark , with some suggesting that number could reach as high as 250,000 . " ' american-style conditions ' are used by many people to paint a horror scenario about health care here , " said dr. hans-jürgen marcus , spokesperson for the national conference on poverty in germany , especially given the fact that some 45 million in the united states are uninsured . " no one can seriously say we have a bad system , but we 're seeing more holes developing in the net , that 's for sure , " he said .
" we have to watch out for that . " worrywarts ? germany 's federal government has made health-care reform one of its priorities and is now working on hammering out a strategy to increase competition and efficiency , cut costs , and ensure the system 's long-term financial stability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal heath minister ulla schmidt has been handed the tricky task of health care reform but the word " reform " tends to make germans nervous since it is perceived as meaning that something one previously had is about to be taken away .
in some respects , that will likely be the case , according to jeannette arenz , head of the health care department at the paritätischer wohlfahrtsverband , a leading umbrella group for german charitable organizations . she does n't worry about an overall degradation of basic health care , which she , like other experts , categorizes as good .
but she does see a tendency towards higher co-payments and more services that will not be covered by insurance plans in the future . she does agree that more people are falling through the cracks of the system these days , and the numbers of uninsured are rising .
but on a trip to brussels last week , she came across a study which found that among europeans , germans are the most dissatisfied with their own system , although many studies show it to be among the best in europe . " i think it 's because germans want to feel 100 percent secure when it comes to health care , " she said .
" and that 's just not possible anymore .

but authorities say that while racial tensions have been rising in potsdam , the attack is not part of a trend . police have no new leads in a brutal easter morning attack on a german citizen of ethiopian descent in potsdam , in the state of brandenburg , near berlin .
the victim , a 37-year-old engineer , is fighting for his life after being repeatedly kicked in the head by at least two people . authorities said , however , that they have several clues , including a recording of a telephone call the victim made as he was arguing with his assailants .
although the message is difficult to decipher , certain parts come through clearly .
specifically , the words " dirty nigger " and the victim 's own voice , asking his attackers to behave , can be heard .
he had made the call to his wife , but she was asleep , and did n't get the message on her voice mail until the next morning . the city 's public prosecutor 's office is treating the crime as an attempted murder of a xenophobic nature .
spokesman benedikt welfens said that while racial tensions had been rising in potsdam , the attack was not part of a trend . " as far as i can tell , there are an increasing number of minor attacks , insults , provocations , and , of course , foreigners will sometimes be insulted or bodily attacked , but never before in this dimension , " welfens said .
" this is for me an isolated incident , unlike anything i have seen before in all the years i have been on the job . " attack has changed potsdam 's atmosphere according to potsdam 's mayor jan jakobs , the " despicable " attack has changed the city . " something like this ca n't help but change the atmosphere of a city , " jakobs said .
" until now , people had the feeling they could walk freely on the streets , and i know from lots of people who have come here from other countries that they enjoy living here .
what happened today could make finding that feeling a bit more difficult . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg schönbohm wants to see the assailants punished he said he was " highly unsettled " by the attack 's brutality . brandenburg interior minister jörg schönbohm said there would be strong penalties for the crime . " in this country we do not tolerate that extremists chase , beat up or even murder people because of their skin color , religion or political positions , " schönbohm said at a press conference on monday . courageous taxi driver saved victim the victim was born in addis ababa , but has had german citizenship for several years .
he is married to a german woman and has two children .
he was waiting at a streetcar stop early easter sunday morning in a quiet residential neighborhood near the famous sanssouci palace , when two strangers began to insult him .
he answered back and was then hit with a bottle , thrown to the ground and beaten up .
the assailants stole less than 200 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- and his keys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing party dvu is represented in brandenburg 's state government welfens said the fact that he 's still alive can be attributed to a courageous taxi driver . " when the taxi driver saw the victim hit the ground , he approached the scene and got out of his taxi , then moved towards the apparent assailants , who then fled the scene of the crime , " welfens said .
" as far as we can tell , the taxi driver saved this man 's life . " the taxi driver followed the thugs , but lost them in the dark .
he described them as two caucasians , between 180 and 190 centimeters -lrb- around six feet -rrb- tall , with short hair - possibly shaved heads .
one wore a black bomber jacket with a white logo , and one of them may have been a woman - a theory that prosecutors also share , after hearing the high pitch of one of the voices on the recording . potsdamers show their solidarity the victim is in the hospital , with severe injuries to his skull and ribs .
doctors have placed him in an artificial coma to relieve swelling on the brain .
his condition is being described as stable , but critical . prosecutors in potsdam have offered a 5,000-euro -lrb- $ 6,113 -rrb- reward for information leading to the arrest of the attackers . on monday night , protesters took to the streets in a show of solidarity with the victim - and to demonstrate that racist violence will not be tolerated . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-racism groups slam german ads racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

in june 2004 , the first minister tasked the scottish law commission -lrb- slc -rrb- with reviewing definitions of crimes , levels of proof required and consent issues .
the slc has asked people to give views via its website at scotlaw.gov.uk.
jack mcconnell called for the review by the independent body after high-profile court cases in 2004 .
one of these involved german tourist bayram cinci , who was alleged to have forced a swedish backpacker to have sex with him in a shower at a hostel in oban .
cinci , who had denied rape , was jailed for five years in 2002 but was freed on appeal when judges decided there was insufficient evidence to prove that the woman did not consent to having sex .
there may be many different views of what ' consent ' is , or of what sort of behaviour can be evidence of ' consent ' fiona southward , slc key issue of consent in an accompanying article for the bbc scotland news website , fiona southward of the slc said the review has set out to end ambiguity about what constitutes consent .
it has offered two suggestions of " free agreement " and " positive co-operation " which could be defined in statute , while the slc still remains open to other proposals .
she said : " there may be many different views of what ' consent ' is , or of what sort of behaviour can be evidence of ' consent ' .
" if there is no definition , then the door is open to prejudices about the way women dress , drink and behave .
male rape " it also means there is nothing in legislation to say how the law expects a person to behave and how people are to understand the behaviour of others . "
the slc has suggested drawing up a list of possible scenarios which would assist jurors in establishing when consent has not been given .
the main proposals also covered by the consultation are the redefinition of rape - to include male rape , protection of those vulnerable to sexual exploitation , application of the law equally to men and women and a review of rules of evidence .
once the consultation period has been completed , the commission intends to publish a final report and draft legislation for consideration by ministers and the scottish parliament next year .

the slc is still seeking people 's views on this and other issues as it continues its review and you can contribute via its website at scotlaw.gov.uk.
ambiguity about consent " can lead to prejudice towards women " we all agree that where a person has not consented to sex then for someone to proceed to have sex with that person is criminal .
but if lack of consent is crucial , what is ' consent ' ?
in scotland a jury must decide for itself what ' consent ' means and the scottish law commission has recently pointed out that this can lead to ambiguity .
there may be many different views of what ' consent ' is , or of what sort of behaviour can be evidence of ' consent ' .
if there is no definition , then the door is open to prejudice about the way women dress , drink and behave .
it also means there is nothing in legislation to say how the law expects a person to behave and how people are to understand the behaviour of others .
the commission has suggested that consent could be defined in statute .
it offers two definitions , though is open to suggestions on other options .
the commission has suggested that the definition should be accompanied by a list of certain situations which indicate that consent is not present the first is " free agreement " .
the second is " positive co-operation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will ; involving persons acting freely and voluntarily and with knowledge of the nature of the act in question " .
as potential jurors would we find these definitions helpful in determining the existence of consent in what can often be very complicated situations surrounding sexual matters ?
in order to assist jurors further in determining the existence of consent the commission has also suggested that the definition should be accompanied by a list of certain situations which indicate that consent is not present .
the list would include situations where violence or threats are used against the victim , or against a third person ; where the victim is unconscious or asleep ; where the victim is held prisoner ; and where consent has been given not by the person but by a third party .
' take advantage ' the list should also include where a person has taken or been given alcohol or other substances and as a result lacked the capacity to consent .
should all these situations be included ?
should they be refined ?
are there any other situations that should be added to the list , for example , where a person is blackmailed ?
sex involving very drunk people is a particularly difficult issue .
it is clear that no criminal liability can be attached to someone who has sex with a person who as the result of alcohol has decided to enter into a sexual encounter with them , a decision they would not have made if they were sober .
however , it seems equally clear that it is criminal to take advantage of someone who is so drunk that they are clearly incapable of making a decision .
would the commission 's approach assist a jury in determining what types of drunken sexual activity should be criminal and what types not ?
would a jury require more information about what the law understands about consent and the ability to give it ?

the slc is still seeking people 's views on this and other issues as it continues its review and you can contribute via its website at scotlaw.gov.uk.
ambiguity about consent " can lead to prejudice towards women " we all agree that where a person has not consented to sex then for someone to proceed to have sex with that person is criminal .
but if lack of consent is crucial , what is ' consent ' ?
in scotland a jury must decide for itself what ' consent ' means and the scottish law commission has recently pointed out that this can lead to ambiguity .
there may be many different views of what ' consent ' is , or of what sort of behaviour can be evidence of ' consent ' .
if there is no definition , then the door is open to prejudice about the way women dress , drink and behave .
it also means there is nothing in legislation to say how the law expects a person to behave and how people are to understand the behaviour of others .
the commission has suggested that consent could be defined in statute .
it offers two definitions , though is open to suggestions on other options .
the commission has suggested that the definition should be accompanied by a list of certain situations which indicate that consent is not present the first is " free agreement " .
the second is " positive co-operation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will ; involving persons acting freely and voluntarily and with knowledge of the nature of the act in question " .
as potential jurors would we find these definitions helpful in determining the existence of consent in what can often be very complicated situations surrounding sexual matters ?
in order to assist jurors further in determining the existence of consent the commission has also suggested that the definition should be accompanied by a list of certain situations which indicate that consent is not present .
the list would include situations where violence or threats are used against the victim , or against a third person ; where the victim is unconscious or asleep ; where the victim is held prisoner ; and where consent has been given not by the person but by a third party .
' take advantage ' the list should also include where a person has taken or been given alcohol or other substances and as a result lacked the capacity to consent .
should all these situations be included ?
should they be refined ?
are there any other situations that should be added to the list , for example , where a person is blackmailed ?
sex involving very drunk people is a particularly difficult issue .
it is clear that no criminal liability can be attached to someone who has sex with a person who as the result of alcohol has decided to enter into a sexual encounter with them , a decision they would not have made if they were sober .
however , it seems equally clear that it is criminal to take advantage of someone who is so drunk that they are clearly incapable of making a decision .
would the commission 's approach assist a jury in determining what types of drunken sexual activity should be criminal and what types not ?
would a jury require more information about what the law understands about consent and the ability to give it ?

gp wages have risen by up to 25 % since the contracts were introduced in 2004 , according to specialist accounts .
the figures come from an annual survey by the association of independent specialist medical accountants due out later this month .
experts have said the contract was ill devised and is partly responsible for current nhs deficits .
there are thousands of people who are alive and well today as a direct result of this new contract health secretary patricia hewitt q & a : gp pay do gps earn their crust ?
the results of the survey of earnings suggest the average annual income for gps could rise to £ 120,000 before tax .
but the figures also give evidence that some gps are earning up to £ 250,000 .
gps , however , say only a tiny minority earn that much .
they argue their income had to be boosted , as it had fallen below that of other comparable professionals .
overspends one accountancy firm in the north-east of england said it has just under 10 gps earning between £ 200,000 and £ 250,000 a year .
the survey is the first of its kind since the gp contract came into effect between april and december 2004 .
it does not look like a terribly good deal at the moment for the taxpayer and the patient niall dickson , king 's fund policy experts have said the government miscalculated its sums when it negotiated the deal .
the department of health has confirmed the current overspend on gps is £ 300m .
dr prit buttar , a gp in abingdon in oxfordshire , told the bbc radio 4 's today programme that the new contract was proving to be very lucrative .
the partners in his 10,000-patient practice now earn in excess of £ 100,000 a year after expenses - a rise of around 20 % .
he said , for instance , his practice now received funds for monitoring cholesterol and blood pressure levels of patients with heart disease .
" it is something that we were doing already .
there are elements of it where it is frankly bean-counting for its own sake - and i do n't think anybody would pretend otherwise . "
complex businesses however , dr hamish meldrum , lead gp negotiator for the british medical association , told the bbc average gp earnings were a bit below £ 100,000 a year .
he said the new contract was needed because gps ' earnings had fallen below those of other comparable professionals .
have your say gps provide a service that can not be provided by any other profession lewis , milton keynes send us your comments dr meldrum said some gps were earning more money because they were now running a complex business .
he said : " the government has been encouraging gps to expand to run super surgeries to grow bigger .
" there will be a few gps who are at the top of these and primarily they are getting that sort of money for actually running quite a complex business rather than necessarily providing health care . "
tony blair defended big pay rises for gps and nurses .
he said : " when people say why have you spent so much on nurses and doctors ' pay , i say because it 's right we make our gps the best paid in europe , and boost nurses ' pay and conditions , which is why the number of doctors in training is up over 68 % , and nurses by 67 % . "
patricia hewitt , the health secretary , said gp pay was now tied to the work they actually did , rather than the size of their patient list .
" there are thousands of people who are alive and well today as a direct result of this new contract .
" this is an enormous improvement in health care , and it is the kind of preventive health care that the public want . "
but she said : " i would be very surprised if there were a lot of gps earning £ 250,000 purely from the nhs . "
productivity niall dickson , from the independent health think tank the king 's fund , said patients were unlikely to support huge pay increases for gps .
" all the suggestions are that gps are being paid more money , but overall we have not seen a big increase in productivity , indeed we may have seen a down in productivity because of shut surgeries on saturday mornings , and no responsibility for 24 hour cover .
" it does not look like a terribly good deal at the moment for the taxpayer and the patient . "
joyce robins , of the pressure group patient concern , said the bma had struck a splendid deal for its members .
" gps are now paid piece-meal , a few thousand for reaching this target , a few thousand for that .
it has created an atmosphere where it seems that every time a gp picks up a pen or looks at a computer , it must have a price tag . "

gp wages have risen by up to 25 % since the contracts were introduced in 2004 , according to specialist accounts .
the figures come from an annual survey by the association of independent specialist medical accountants due out later this month .
experts have said the contract was ill devised and is partly responsible for current nhs deficits .
there are thousands of people who are alive and well today as a direct result of this new contract health secretary patricia hewitt q & a : gp pay do gps earn their crust ?
the results of the survey of earnings suggest the average annual income for gps could rise to £ 120,000 before tax .
but the figures also give evidence that some gps are earning up to £ 250,000 .
gps , however , say only a tiny minority earn that much .
they argue their income had to be boosted , as it had fallen below that of other comparable professionals .
overspends one accountancy firm in the north-east of england said it has just under 10 gps earning between £ 200,000 and £ 250,000 a year .
the survey is the first of its kind since the gp contract came into effect between april and december 2004 .
it does not look like a terribly good deal at the moment for the taxpayer and the patient niall dickson , king 's fund policy experts have said the government miscalculated its sums when it negotiated the deal .
the department of health has confirmed the current overspend on gps is £ 300m .
dr prit buttar , a gp in abingdon in oxfordshire , told the bbc radio 4 's today programme that the new contract was proving to be very lucrative .
the partners in his 10,000-patient practice now earn in excess of £ 100,000 a year after expenses - a rise of around 20 % .
he said , for instance , his practice now received funds for monitoring cholesterol and blood pressure levels of patients with heart disease .
" it is something that we were doing already .
there are elements of it where it is frankly bean-counting for its own sake - and i do n't think anybody would pretend otherwise . "
complex businesses however , dr hamish meldrum , lead gp negotiator for the british medical association , told the bbc average gp earnings were a bit below £ 100,000 a year .
he said the new contract was needed because gps ' earnings had fallen below those of other comparable professionals .
have your say gps provide a service that can not be provided by any other profession lewis , milton keynes send us your comments dr meldrum said some gps were earning more money because they were now running a complex business .
he said : " the government has been encouraging gps to expand to run super surgeries to grow bigger .
" there will be a few gps who are at the top of these and primarily they are getting that sort of money for actually running quite a complex business rather than necessarily providing health care . "
tony blair defended big pay rises for gps and nurses .
he said : " when people say why have you spent so much on nurses and doctors ' pay , i say because it 's right we make our gps the best paid in europe , and boost nurses ' pay and conditions , which is why the number of doctors in training is up over 68 % , and nurses by 67 % . "
patricia hewitt , the health secretary , said gp pay was now tied to the work they actually did , rather than the size of their patient list .
" there are thousands of people who are alive and well today as a direct result of this new contract .
" this is an enormous improvement in health care , and it is the kind of preventive health care that the public want . "
but she said : " i would be very surprised if there were a lot of gps earning £ 250,000 purely from the nhs . "
productivity niall dickson , from the independent health think tank the king 's fund , said patients were unlikely to support huge pay increases for gps .
" all the suggestions are that gps are being paid more money , but overall we have not seen a big increase in productivity , indeed we may have seen a down in productivity because of shut surgeries on saturday mornings , and no responsibility for 24 hour cover .
" it does not look like a terribly good deal at the moment for the taxpayer and the patient . "
joyce robins , of the pressure group patient concern , said the bma had struck a splendid deal for its members .
" gps are now paid piece-meal , a few thousand for reaching this target , a few thousand for that .
it has created an atmosphere where it seems that every time a gp picks up a pen or looks at a computer , it must have a price tag . "

the glasgow centre for population health 's let glasgow flourish report found the city had become more affluent in the past 20 years .
but despite a reduction in smoking and unemployment , glasgow 's death rate continued to outstrip the birth rate .
highlighting obesity and alcohol abuse , gcph director carol tannahill said the " legacy of poor health " remained .
the report , produced by a team led by professor phil hanlon of glasgow university , found the average life expectancy for men was 69 and 76 for women .
the city 's death rate exceeds the birth rate , which could seriously affect population numbers in the future , the report stated . "
health inequalities are stark and are increasing on a whole range of dimensions " carol tannahill gcph director dr tannahill said : " although glasgow as a city has changed physically , socially and economically over recent decades , its legacy of poor health remains .
" health inequalities are stark and are increasing on a whole range of dimensions .
" growing health problems such as obesity and alcohol-related harm are not so clearly linked to poverty but are problems that affect the population as a whole . "
prof hanlon said : " it is evident that we will need to widen the range of approaches being implemented to improve health .
' complex problems ' " there will be no simple solutions to the problems faced by glasgow .
certainly , there will be no single initiative that will turn round such a complex set of problems with such deep roots in history . "
sir john arbuthnott , chairman of nhs greater glasgow and clyde , said the " intractable problem " of health inequalities remained despite " remarkable " changes in recent decades .

baa has confirmed that it received and rejected an 870 pence-per-share bid from a consortium led by goldman sachs .
" the board of baa rejected this approach because it clearly fails to reflect the true value of the company , " baa said in a statement .
baa runs seven uk airports , including heathrow , gatwick and stansted .

baa airports heathrow gatwick stansted southampton glasgow edinburgh aberdeen see baa 's share price the newspaper said hank paulson , goldman sachs ' chief executive , had ordered the bank to stop making hostile bids using its own money following a " backlash against its role in a string of uk offers " .
the bid for baa from the goldman sachs-led consortium came after a consortium led by spanish construction group ferrovial had seen their hostile bid of 810p per share rejected .
at the time baa said that the ferrovial offer undervalued the company and was " not beginning to reflect the true value of baa 's unique portfolio of strategic airport assets " .
baa is the largest airports operator in the uk , and has also been looking to expand abroad .
it recently trumped other rivals when it paid the hungarian government $ 2.2bn -lrb- £ 1.24bn -rrb- for control of budapest airport .

snyder rini , the former deputy prime minister , pledged to work towards peace and reconciliation as well as economic recovery in the south pacific nation .
his appointment sparked protests from backers of a rival candidate , who said he would not provide a fresh start .
former leader allan kemakeza decided to step down after only narrowly retaining his seat in a 5 april general election .
mr kemakeza 's people 's alliance party suffered losses in the polls following allegations of corruption among several ministers .
the elections were the first since an australian-led force arrived to restore peace in the country in 2003 , after violence stirred up by local warlords left hundreds dead and 20,000 displaced .
retaining security speaking after his election , the 56-year-old mr rini said he would continue to work closely with the peacekeepers , adding that they would leave " only when security is in place " .
mr rini beat off two main rivals , the former prime minister manasseh sogavare and job dudley tausinga , the leader of the new rural advancement party .
some 500 supporters of mr tausinga - who had led in the first round of voting - gathered around the parliament building in the capital honiara following the announcement .
the mps were kept inside as police in riot gear moved in to disperse the crowd amid reports of stone-throwing and looting .
