archaeologists found the fundaments of a preceding roman building beneath it .
enthusiasts of roman history and architecture will find this very interesting . the church should also be of interest to others as it was restored in baroque style in order to fit with the whole town 's general atmosphere .
part of the restoration was the huge barrel-vault which spans the nave and is the most powerful in franconia . there might be a lot of further churches and sights in herzogenaurach , but that 's not all : herzogenaurachers are a joyful community who love to celebrate .
from june 16 until june 18 , the annual old town festival , the altstadtfest , is celebrated .
during these days there is a stage at the palace garden where local music bands play folk music . on july 29 and july 30 , people dress up in medieval-style clothes in line with the theme of the actual festival , the medieval spectacle -lrb- mittelalterspectaculum -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracking down soccer 's superstars germany will be flooded with soccer stars this summer , but as world cup tickets start selling out , lurking outside the hotel could be the best way to catch the game 's biggest names .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2006 right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic conservative kaczynski has swung poland to the right after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration . jacek purski was shocked to discover his photograph on the internet page of poland 's right-wing extremist group " blood & honor . "
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .

it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .
they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2006 right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic conservative kaczynski has swung poland to the right after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration . jacek purski was shocked to discover his photograph on the internet page of poland 's right-wing extremist group " blood & honor . "
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .
the last time the world cup was held on german soil in 1974 west germany beat the netherlands in the final . an example of science overcoming reason ?

four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .

still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .

" the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .
club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid .
-lrb- oct .
30 , 2005 -rrb- ballack told by bayern : " sign or go " it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

the answer could come within days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.03.2006 ballack and chelsea : a marriage of ambition and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern golden boy ballack may be getting the blues this summer although far from confirmed , it looks increasingly likely that english champions chelsea will sign michael ballack this summer .
it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .

" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2006 germany 's deutsche mark lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of these are still hidden in german pockets it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .
still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .

but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.03.2006 ballack and chelsea : a marriage of ambition and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern golden boy ballack may be getting the blues this summer although far from confirmed , it looks increasingly likely that english champions chelsea will sign michael ballack this summer .
it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2006 germany 's deutsche mark lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of these are still hidden in german pockets it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .
still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 04.03.2006 ballack and chelsea : a marriage of ambition and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern golden boy ballack may be getting the blues this summer although far from confirmed , it looks increasingly likely that english champions chelsea will sign michael ballack this summer .
it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .

bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2006 germany 's deutsche mark lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billions of these are still hidden in german pockets it 's been four years since the euro was introduced and the deutsche mark became history .
still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .
but some others , like poland 's zloty , hungary 's forint and the czech crown , could be around longer .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

he added that recent allegations that members of germany 's intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- supplied us officials with saddam hussein 's defense plans only added to an already existing list of questions about germany 's involvement in the invasion of iraq and the role it has played in the war on terror . an inquiry can only happen if at least one quarter of parliamentarians supports it .
that means that all three opposition parties - the fdp , the greens and the left party - must back the proposal .
the latter two have already said that they would vote in favor of an inquiry . on monday , the secret parliamentary control committee , which oversees germany 's secret intelligence services , will be hearing testimony from a former intelligence agent in baghdad about allegations of a german role in getting hussein 's defense plans to the americans . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany asks us for details on secret iraq plan germany has asked the us for more information about an alleged secret plan by saddam hussein to defend baghdad before the war after a us paper reported its spies had passed it on to american forces .

"
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .

they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .

" homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

its historical background routes far beyond the establishment of the adidas and puma headquarters .
even the argentinean national team has chosen to stay at a hotel in herzogenaurach during this year 's soccer world cup due to the town 's characteristics and originalities . historical origi n s a n d sights during the 13th centurym , a castle was built in herzogenaurach .
it was destroyed during the thirty years ' war -lrb- 1618 - 1648 -rrb- .
in 1720 however , bishop lothar franz had the castle rebuilt in baroque style .
it is now accessible for tourists . from the castle , it 's an easy walk to the market place .
the fountain in the middle of it guarantees a medieval atmosphere without the absence of modern day surroundings such as shops or restaurants . not far from there is the main road that 's lined with two towers .
once part of the inner-city walls they are now the town 's landmark .
over the centuries , the eastern tower was used for multiple purposes , such as to store the city 's money or as the town 's prison .
until world war ii it was used as the town 's museum . today the museum is only a few meters away from the eastern tower .
during the 1990s the building was completely restored as it used to be a nursing home .
it is now a popular place which is constantly visited by tourists and locals . churches a n d celebratio n s probably the most exciting sight in herzogenaurach is the st. maria magdalena parish church .
archaeologists found the fundaments of a preceding roman building beneath it .
enthusiasts of roman history and architecture will find this very interesting . the church should also be of interest to others as it was restored in baroque style in order to fit with the whole town 's general atmosphere .
part of the restoration was the huge barrel-vault which spans the nave and is the most powerful in franconia . there might be a lot of further churches and sights in herzogenaurach , but that 's not all : herzogenaurachers are a joyful community who love to celebrate .
from june 16 until june 18 , the annual old town festival , the altstadtfest , is celebrated .
during these days there is a stage at the palace garden where local music bands play folk music . on july 29 and july 30 , people dress up in medieval-style clothes in line with the theme of the actual festival , the medieval spectacle -lrb- mittelalterspectaculum -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ha -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tracking down soccer 's superstars germany will be flooded with soccer stars this summer , but as world cup tickets start selling out , lurking outside the hotel could be the best way to catch the game 's biggest names .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july .

bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .

" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2006 right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic conservative kaczynski has swung poland to the right after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration . jacek purski was shocked to discover his photograph on the internet page of poland 's right-wing extremist group " blood & honor . "
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky . madleine kunkel has got a busy day ahead of her .
the 29-year-old hairdresser started work at 7 a.m. in the morning and she 's not going to leave the hairdresser 's salon where she 's employed before 6 p.m. in the evening . in spite of working long hours though , she said she 's hardly able to make ends meet at her current wages of just under five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- an hour . " it 's really very little , " kunkel said .
" without the income of my husband i would n't be able to live just on what i earn .
so a minimum wage of six or seven euros an hour would of course be great for me . " below-average wages cause for co n cer n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages in various sectors have been dipping wages in germany have been sliding in recent years thus inflating the ranks of the so-called working poor - people like kunkel who have full-time jobs but are earning below-average wages . economists have suggested that minimum wage levels of around six euros an hour would be enough for people to live on but at the same time would prevent major job losses . germany 's powerful trade unions believe though that the minimum should be 7.50 euros .
since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .
he 's called on chancellor angela merkel to act .
frank bsirske , head of the giant services union verdi agrees . " i welcome mr platzeck 's move in favor of a minimum wage , " he said .
" we must eventually catch up with other western european countries such as ireland , great britain or belgium where minimum wages of between seven and eight euros have been introduced .
it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .
they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .
" after all it would mean a violation of german laws governing collective bargaining for wages .
i can only warn the government against taking this step . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has promised a public debate on the issue german chancellor angela merkel , however , seems determined to do something for germany 's working poor .
she said she 's open for a public debate which , however , should also include the possibility of government subsidies for those earning low wages . later this year , after the summer break , her coalition government of conservatives and social democrats intends to have appropriate legislation ready . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany serious about minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .
dfb and beckenbauer back klinsmann bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer has backed klinsmann 's leadership immediately after the florence fiasco the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- backed klinsmann to get it right at the world cup with dfb president theo zwanziger pointing out that there had been setbacks in the build-up to previous world cups . " in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals . " a managerial discussion months before the world cup would be the worst thing that could happen to us , " beckenbauer told bild .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .

they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .

still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : through thick and thin , germans were strangely attached to their currency " there 's surely quite a bit abroad , " said deichert .
" in the days of the d-mark there was an estimate that around a quarter of the d-mark supply was in circulation abroad .
but we do n't know how much . " a sizable stock of marks is likely to be found in eastern europe , particularly in the countries that used it as a parallel or even as an official currency , such as in the balkans .
lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home of unreturned marks ? germans still have opportunities to spend their marks too .
ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .
perhaps that gives the mark 's fans some consolation : though they have euros in their wallets , they may just be paying with a bit of deutsche mark , too . insa wrede -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german phones to take old d-mark coins german phone company deutsche telekom has switched over some 50,000 public telephone booths to take old deutsche mark coins .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.03.2006 germany divided over minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of jobs in germany pay below-average wages the german government is giving some serious thought to introducing a minimum wage to counter dipping salaries .
but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky . madleine kunkel has got a busy day ahead of her .
the 29-year-old hairdresser started work at 7 a.m. in the morning and she 's not going to leave the hairdresser 's salon where she 's employed before 6 p.m. in the evening . in spite of working long hours though , she said she 's hardly able to make ends meet at her current wages of just under five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- an hour . " it 's really very little , " kunkel said .
" without the income of my husband i would n't be able to live just on what i earn .
so a minimum wage of six or seven euros an hour would of course be great for me . " below-average wages cause for co n cer n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages in various sectors have been dipping wages in germany have been sliding in recent years thus inflating the ranks of the so-called working poor - people like kunkel who have full-time jobs but are earning below-average wages . economists have suggested that minimum wage levels of around six euros an hour would be enough for people to live on but at the same time would prevent major job losses . germany 's powerful trade unions believe though that the minimum should be 7.50 euros .
since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .
he 's called on chancellor angela merkel to act .
frank bsirske , head of the giant services union verdi agrees . " i welcome mr platzeck 's move in favor of a minimum wage , " he said .
" we must eventually catch up with other western european countries such as ireland , great britain or belgium where minimum wages of between seven and eight euros have been introduced .
it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .

factors such as the crowd , the surroundings and the expectation could not only give germany a twelfth man on the pitch but could also add up to added impetus to get through the qualifying rounds . home crowd , familiarity and preparation valuable assets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the home crowd could carry germany through " the reasons for success at home are legion : euphoric fans , familiar environment , meticulous preparation , " the institute report states , adding that the home team had won a third of all world cups since the inaugural tournament in 1930 .
" in addition , the host nation qualifies and goes into the draw for the finals automatically .
that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2006 right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic conservative kaczynski has swung poland to the right after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration . jacek purski was shocked to discover his photograph on the internet page of poland 's right-wing extremist group " blood & honor . "
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .
dfb and beckenbauer back klinsmann bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer has backed klinsmann 's leadership immediately after the florence fiasco the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- backed klinsmann to get it right at the world cup with dfb president theo zwanziger pointing out that there had been setbacks in the build-up to previous world cups . " in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals . " a managerial discussion months before the world cup would be the worst thing that could happen to us , " beckenbauer told bild .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

"
klinsmann 's tactics are of concern to parliamentarians having the tabloids on your back when your team lose is part of being a soccer coach but jürgen klinsmann is feeling new heat after politicians called for him to attend a parliamentary session to explain his methods . being lambasted by the national press rarely concerns germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann but the prospect of being summoned before a parliamentary committee to explain his training methods before the world cup should surely ruffle the usually calm klinsi 's feathers . according to bild tabloid on saturday , several members of parliament from the ruling christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have called on klinsmann to explain why germany were so outplayed in the 4-1 defeat by italy on wednesday and why his players looked as though they were chasing shadows for much of the game . government 's sports body getting world cup jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's favored practice of telepathy is not getting results " it would be good if herr klinsmann would come before the sport committee and explain what his concept is and how germany can win the world cup , " said norbert barthle , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's cdu .
" the match against italy was gruesome and we wonder that can be fixed by the summer .
the federal government is the biggest sponsor of the world cup .
in light of that , i 'd like to get a few answers from him . " reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .
dfb and beckenbauer back klinsmann bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer has backed klinsmann 's leadership immediately after the florence fiasco the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- backed klinsmann to get it right at the world cup with dfb president theo zwanziger pointing out that there had been setbacks in the build-up to previous world cups . " in 1954 , 1974 and 1990 there were bad results prior to the tournaments and heated discussions , " zwanziger said .
" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals . " a managerial discussion months before the world cup would be the worst thing that could happen to us , " beckenbauer told bild .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .

" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .
club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid .
-lrb- oct .
30 , 2005 -rrb- ballack told by bayern : " sign or go " it was a marriage made in heaven : germany 's one true superstar and the bundesliga 's only real superpower .

that means -lrb- as a seeded nation -rrb- they often face easy opponents in the group phase . " while germany were being picked off by a confident italian side in florence , their group a opponents were not fairing well either .
costa rica went down 3-2 away to iran , poland lost 1-0 to the united states in kaiserslautern and ecuador were defeated by the same score away to the netherlands .
none , however , fared as badly as germany did . this should not be a problem come june and july , according to the iw institute .
of the world cups germany has taken part in , the team on average has the quarter- or semi-finals .
factoring into this an average boost of 2.5 rounds from hosting the tournament compared with playing away and the statisticians can see michael ballack holding the trophy aloft on july 9 before a rapturous german public . playing at home can boost average performance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france won the cup at home in 1998 while this takes a small suspension of belief at the moment , there are precedents on which this calculation is based .
in 1998 , france advanced 4.5 rounds further than their average performance when they rode the wave of home support to beat brazil in the final in the stade de france . other winners at home like england and uruguay also went 4.5 rounds further than the average when they won the world cup at home , in 1930 and 1966 respectively . and then there is the small matter of german history .
the last time the world cup was held on german soil in 1974 west germany beat the netherlands in the final . an example of science overcoming reason ?

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .

" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .

while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .

" reinhold hemker , a spd deputy on the sport committee , also had questions about the team 's fitness for the world cup and the future of soccer in germany under klinsmann 's leadership . ministers calling for clarity as tournament approaches bildunterschrift : the uncertainty in the squad could undermine performance " i 'd like to hear from jürgen klinsmann how he plans to create a secure foundation for the team , " hemker said .
" klinsmann has good players but there are too many uncertainties .
he should start saying clearly who he is counting on . " miriam gruss , a member of the opposition liberal free democrats on the panel , also demanded answers . " the world cup is of national interest , " she said .
" he should stop experimenting and inform the sport committee of his plans .
it 's not just a question of whether a team plays poorly .
it 's the larger question : how is the team presenting itself ? " but an appearance by klinsmann before the committee is unlikely as the latter 's chairman , peter danckert -lrb- spd -rrb- , rejected the " crazy idea " in an interview with netzeitung .
greens parliamentary leader fritz kuhn also said he was opposed to the plan .
" anyone who wants to drag klinsi before the committee , is n't quite clear in the head , " he said , adding that in that case , members of parliament might as well decide on who gets to play in the german team .

" but we ended up being crowned world champions . " franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee , also backed klinsmann , saying it would be folly to discuss his future just months before the finals .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .
" the trend is in this direction -lrb- to move to chelsea -rrb- .
michael had initially been very keen on real madrid .
but the leadership changes there in the last few months mean we do n't know what 's happening . " the fact that madrid have also failed to collect any silverware in the past two seasons may also have something to do with it while chelsea are reigning premiership champions and , barring a sensational end of season collapse , will win the english league again this season . potential suitors discarded as title aspirations evaporate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite big signings , real madrid have failed to live up to the hype other suitors mentioned in becker 's regular dispatches over the past six months have also apparently fallen by the wayside as their potential title-winning pedigrees have slipped from view . manchester united would have presented ballack with a paltry league cup winners medal for all his efforts had he joined in the january transfer window , with chelsea disappearing over the horizon in the championship race and the champions league a distant memory after failing to advance from the group stage . barcelona , once mentioned in one breathy statement , have a wealth of midfield talent and have bigger fish at the end of their hook . and while an italian newspaper claimed on thursday that ballack ’ s representatives had held talks with inter milan , becker scotched such nonsense by reaffirming his client 's public desire to win the european cup , something inter , he believes , are some way from achieving . ballack 's desire to be a european champion endures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack has an overwhelming desire to lift the european cup " michael will continue his career with a side that will win the champions league .
he definitely will not go to inter milan , " becker stressed .
" he would only move to a club where he has a better chance of winning the champions league than at bayern .
inter are currently third in serie a , whereas bayern are top in the german league . " so why leave at all ?
bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .
while bundesliga medals may in time force him to invest in sturdier furniture , could he really consider himself a world class player at the end of his career if he had not played abroad and captured the biggest prizes ? chelsea 's financial power borders on monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea spent 38m euros on lyon 's michael essien while ballack could be excused for being seduced by chelsea 's promise of silverware - and an alleged 175,000 euro -lrb- $ 210,778 -rrb- weekly pay packet – the london club 's willingness and ability to sign the world 's best players on a whim is causing increasing concern around europe 's leagues . money is no object for chelsea – although ballack would be able to move as a free agent in the summer as his contract expires .
clubs are finding it hard to hang onto players chelsea covet , even harder to say no to the money they offer and harder still to compete in a transfer market in which chelsea dominate . the move would be a good one for ballack and possibly the step-up he needs to become a really great player but it would also spell further bad news for europe 's other teams .
michael ballack in the blue of chelsea would signify that , in this day and age , no club has the financial influence to match the pulling power of stamford bridge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ballack gets transfer tips from the kaiser the future of bayern munich midfield star michael ballack remains uncertain .
club president franz beckenbauer said however , if he were ballack , then he would go to spanish team real madrid .

lost to wishes in foundations the bundesbank expected that a lot of the marks would n't come back to them , at least when it came to coins , deichert said . " there were estimates that around 40 percent of the coins would n't come back , " he explained .
" that 's on the basis of other monetary reforms , such as in britain .
the coins may have disappeared into fountains , become part of collections .
we always assumed the majority of notes would come back .
we certainly did n't expect that it would take place over such a long amount of time . "

ngos , like the red cross , and schools collect them for charitable causes .
stores put on events in which customers can pay with whatever marks they still have .
but the supply is continually shrinking , for when they 're turned in to the bundesbank , their days are numbered . " the notes are immediately shredded , " deichert said .
the coins are first deformed and later melted down , and the raw materials are then used for other metallic bonds . " the silver coins , say , can be used in glasses frames and sparkplugs as well as for one and two euro coins .

but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky . madleine kunkel has got a busy day ahead of her .
the 29-year-old hairdresser started work at 7 a.m. in the morning and she 's not going to leave the hairdresser 's salon where she 's employed before 6 p.m. in the evening . in spite of working long hours though , she said she 's hardly able to make ends meet at her current wages of just under five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- an hour . " it 's really very little , " kunkel said .
" without the income of my husband i would n't be able to live just on what i earn .
so a minimum wage of six or seven euros an hour would of course be great for me . " below-average wages cause for co n cer n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages in various sectors have been dipping wages in germany have been sliding in recent years thus inflating the ranks of the so-called working poor - people like kunkel who have full-time jobs but are earning below-average wages . economists have suggested that minimum wage levels of around six euros an hour would be enough for people to live on but at the same time would prevent major job losses . germany 's powerful trade unions believe though that the minimum should be 7.50 euros .
since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .
he 's called on chancellor angela merkel to act .
frank bsirske , head of the giant services union verdi agrees . " i welcome mr platzeck 's move in favor of a minimum wage , " he said .
" we must eventually catch up with other western european countries such as ireland , great britain or belgium where minimum wages of between seven and eight euros have been introduced .
it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .
they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .
" after all it would mean a violation of german laws governing collective bargaining for wages .
i can only warn the government against taking this step . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has promised a public debate on the issue german chancellor angela merkel , however , seems determined to do something for germany 's working poor .
she said she 's open for a public debate which , however , should also include the possibility of government subsidies for those earning low wages . later this year , after the summer break , her coalition government of conservatives and social democrats intends to have appropriate legislation ready . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany serious about minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .

still , 15 billion of the former german currency is still out there . a trusted friend who helped them transform their country from postwar devastation to an economic powerhouse , the germans found it hard to part with the deutsche mark .
four years after saying good-bye , many of them still calculate euro prices back into the mark to get a feeling for how cheap or expensive something is . around 15 billion d-marks - half notes and half coins - were in circulation by the end of 2005 , said uwe deichert , a spokesman for the bundesbank , germany 's central bank .
that 's about 7.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " one couple brought us 10,000 marks , the money they had received as a wedding present .
they had wanted to pay for their honeymoon with it , but they misplaced the money and the trip had to be cancelled .
after 11 years , they found it while moving and were able to go on a honeymoon after all . " thus the marks make their way back to their origin , the bundesbank , where they 're now exchanged into euros free of charge and for an unlimited time .
on average , 2,000 people exchange 560 marks at the bank 's branches every day , deichert said .
but germans are n't the only ones who 've stashed deutsche marks .

it could be a good move for ballack but an ominous one for european soccer in general . it would be the marriage of ambition and money if it were to go through .
michael ballack , germany 's one true superstar player and national captain , and chelsea , english premiership champions and soccer shopaholics , could be tying the knot sometime this summer if you read between the lines of soccer 's most quoted agent michael becker 's latest statement . becker , who seems to be generating as many column inches these days as his main client , issued the latest of his almost daily updates on the situation regarding ballack 's future earlier this week and fuelled the already blazing speculation that the midfielder will be heading to london as soon as the dust settles on germany ’ s 2006 world cup campaign in july . " nothing has been signed , but there will be ongoing contact with chelsea .
there is strong interest from both sides , " becker said thursday .

bayern ’ s dominance of the bundesliga would give ballack an annual crack at european soccer 's biggest prize and , unless the likes of werder bremen , hamburg or schalke rein them in , the law of averages suggests that bayern would win the bundesliga enough times to give ballack at least one champions league success before he hangs up his boots . as a professional , however , ballack understandably wants to be at the top of the game and win the major titles not just once but consistently .

but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky . madleine kunkel has got a busy day ahead of her .
the 29-year-old hairdresser started work at 7 a.m. in the morning and she 's not going to leave the hairdresser 's salon where she 's employed before 6 p.m. in the evening . in spite of working long hours though , she said she 's hardly able to make ends meet at her current wages of just under five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- an hour . " it 's really very little , " kunkel said .
" without the income of my husband i would n't be able to live just on what i earn .
so a minimum wage of six or seven euros an hour would of course be great for me . " below-average wages cause for co n cer n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages in various sectors have been dipping wages in germany have been sliding in recent years thus inflating the ranks of the so-called working poor - people like kunkel who have full-time jobs but are earning below-average wages . economists have suggested that minimum wage levels of around six euros an hour would be enough for people to live on but at the same time would prevent major job losses . germany 's powerful trade unions believe though that the minimum should be 7.50 euros .
since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .
he 's called on chancellor angela merkel to act .
frank bsirske , head of the giant services union verdi agrees . " i welcome mr platzeck 's move in favor of a minimum wage , " he said .
" we must eventually catch up with other western european countries such as ireland , great britain or belgium where minimum wages of between seven and eight euros have been introduced .
it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .
they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .
" after all it would mean a violation of german laws governing collective bargaining for wages .
i can only warn the government against taking this step . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has promised a public debate on the issue german chancellor angela merkel , however , seems determined to do something for germany 's working poor .
she said she 's open for a public debate which , however , should also include the possibility of government subsidies for those earning low wages . later this year , after the summer break , her coalition government of conservatives and social democrats intends to have appropriate legislation ready . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany serious about minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .

during the 1990s the building was completely restored as it used to be a nursing home .

archaeologists found the fundaments of a preceding roman building beneath it .
enthusiasts of roman history and architecture will find this very interesting . the church should also be of interest to others as it was restored in baroque style in order to fit with the whole town 's general atmosphere .
part of the restoration was the huge barrel-vault which spans the nave and is the most powerful in franconia . there might be a lot of further churches and sights in herzogenaurach , but that 's not all : herzogenaurachers are a joyful community who love to celebrate .
from june 16 until june 18 , the annual old town festival , the altstadtfest , is celebrated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.03.2006 right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic conservative kaczynski has swung poland to the right after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration . jacek purski was shocked to discover his photograph on the internet page of poland 's right-wing extremist group " blood & honor . "
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .
" if we just consider the fact that members of this organization who today sit in the polish parliament have saluted with ' heil hitler , ' then we have to realize that we 're dealing with a very dangerous phenomenon . " homophobia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lech kaczynski supporters the election victory of the polish national conservatives has also provided fresh impetus for the right-wing extremist groups .
recently , the police turned a blind eye when a gang of thugs belonging to the " all polish youth " set upon a demonstration of gays and lesbians in the city of poznan . in warsaw , meanwhile , the right-wing demonstrators disrupting a christopher street day parade were known to have close ties with then mayor and current state president lech kaczynski . in such a social climate , the polish right-wing extremists ' black list is probably just the tip of an iceberg .
apparently , the arch-conservative catholic radio maryja , which - contrary to all ecclesiastical norms intervened on behalf of the kaczynski twins in the election campaign - also intends to publish a list of left-wing and liberal enemies of the government . tadeusz rydzkyk , who founded radio maryja in 1991 , is no stranger to this form of witch-hunt . ten years ago , rydzyk 's associates were believed to have issued a blacklist of polish jews . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new polish president sends worrying signals lech kaczynski , winner of poland 's presidential poll , has taken a tough foreign-policy line toward neighboring germany .

"
purski works for the polish civil rights organization " nigdy wecej , " and while examining the web sites of neo-fascist organizations , he hit on a " list of enemies " of polish right-wing radicals . " i 'm on the list , because our organization 's work is apparently very effective and has been ruffling racist feathers , " he said .
" of course i 'm not pleased to be on the list because those are my data and that 's my photo , and naturally it concerns me .
but it does n't scare me - even though that 's exactly what they want . " a serious threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skinheads polish neo-fascists are primarily youths aged between 20 and 30 .
they 're well-organized and violent , and headed-up by intellectuals who publish their right-wing extremist theories in insider magazines or on relevant websites . according to polish writer and journalist adam szostkiewicz , black lists like the one published by " blood and honor " should certainly not be taken lightly . " by denouncing someone , they are encouraging people to fight , and that 's an act of substitute aggression , " he said .
" today it 's no longer acceptable to directly attack people physically so they provide a pretext for it . " moreover , polish right-wing extremists can exert - at least through the back door - more and more political influence .
militant organizations such as " blood & honor " and " combat 18 " cooperate with right-wing extremist parties like the " national rebirth of poland " and the " polish national party . " " all polish youth , " a junior organization of the arch-conservative party " league of polish families , " which tolerates the minority cabinet of prime minister marcinkiewicz in the polish parliament , appears meanwhile to be just as dangerous . " this organization is generally referred to as chauvinistic and one that spreads hate , " purski said .

but agreeing on the amount is proving tricky . madleine kunkel has got a busy day ahead of her .
the 29-year-old hairdresser started work at 7 a.m. in the morning and she 's not going to leave the hairdresser 's salon where she 's employed before 6 p.m. in the evening . in spite of working long hours though , she said she 's hardly able to make ends meet at her current wages of just under five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- an hour . " it 's really very little , " kunkel said .
" without the income of my husband i would n't be able to live just on what i earn .
so a minimum wage of six or seven euros an hour would of course be great for me . " below-average wages cause for co n cer n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wages in various sectors have been dipping wages in germany have been sliding in recent years thus inflating the ranks of the so-called working poor - people like kunkel who have full-time jobs but are earning below-average wages . economists have suggested that minimum wage levels of around six euros an hour would be enough for people to live on but at the same time would prevent major job losses . germany 's powerful trade unions believe though that the minimum should be 7.50 euros .
since european union enlargement towards eastern europe they 've been forced to accept ever lower wages especially for low and unskilled workers in the service sector of the economy . according to a recent study of the about 20 million germans working full-time , a staggering 17 percent earn wages below the subsistence level . social democratic party leader matthias platzeck said that the government must no longer stand by in view of wage developments .
he 's called on chancellor angela merkel to act .
frank bsirske , head of the giant services union verdi agrees . " i welcome mr platzeck 's move in favor of a minimum wage , " he said .
" we must eventually catch up with other western european countries such as ireland , great britain or belgium where minimum wages of between seven and eight euros have been introduced .
it 's about time that we protect german labor here too . " germa n employers n ot co n vi n ced german employers , however , are vehemently opposed to the introduction of minimum wages .
they warn that thousands of jobs would be lost . " there are so many jobs in germany which are paying less than seven euros that a minimum wage at that level would cost an extremely high number of jobs , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce .
" after all it would mean a violation of german laws governing collective bargaining for wages .
i can only warn the government against taking this step . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has promised a public debate on the issue german chancellor angela merkel , however , seems determined to do something for germany 's working poor .
she said she 's open for a public debate which , however , should also include the possibility of government subsidies for those earning low wages . later this year , after the summer break , her coalition government of conservatives and social democrats intends to have appropriate legislation ready . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany serious about minimum wage worried that globalization will give german companies the incentive to sink wages , some politicians are getting loud about a minimum wage .

the two british animators of wallace and gromit : curse of the were-rabbit are in santa monica ready to enjoy the oscar experience , having chosen the bbc for their only pre-awards interview .
or rather , they would be enjoying it a lot more if they had not brought the british rain and snow with them and park 's luggage had not gone astray at the airport .
" my tux was in the suitcase , " he reveals .
" i 've only got the clothes i 'm standing up in - well sitting in , anyway . "
the pair do have their " good luck " bow ties , which designer paul smith made specially for them to wear at the awards .
" if i win , i could always just go up in my bow tie , " park adds , prompting various quips from box about where to hold the oscar .
park , the winner of three previous oscars -lrb- two for wallace and gromit short films , and one for creature comforts -rrb- is back after 10 years with his fifth nomination .
it is box 's first nomination .
' just ridiculous ' while they are careful not to talk as if they will win , the figures are impressive .
were-rabbit has taken roughly £ 115m -lrb- $ 200m -rrb- worldwide and has 26 wins out of 27 nominations , including the alexander korda award for outstanding british film at the baftas . "
the ceremony is absolutely amazing - it 's like being in madame tussauds but they 're all animated " nick park " at the baftas we really did n't think we would win because a lot of the films were worthy and meaningful and deep and our film is just ridiculous , " said box , as park chips in : " i think brokeback mountain could have had more gags . "
park is genuine in his tribute to their two rivals for the academy award - tim burton -lrb- corpse bride -rrb- and japanese animation legend hayao miyazaki -lrb- howl 's moving castle -rrb- , calling him " the most respected animator in the world , let alone japan " .
whether they win or lose , they are looking forward to the ceremony .
" the ceremony is absolutely amazing , " says oscar veteran park .
" you are sat there and you see famous faces walking down .
" it 's like being in madame tussauds but they 're all animated .
" and if you are lucky enough to have an oscar in your hand all these celebrities come up to you and shake your hand .
" we 're animators , we 're not used to getting out of our dark studio and meeting real people , let alone glamorous and attractive ones . "
warehouse fire box the newcomer admits to expecting a severe bout of nerves on the night .
" you might have to get up in front of a billion people . "
park agrees .
" you have got to be ready to not win - and rehearsing wallace 's cheesy smile in case .
but we are determined to try and enjoy it . "
box reveals he " started to panic " when he watched the academy video in which tom hanks advises nominees how to make an impression with their acceptance speech .
they are now working on what they should say if they get their podium moment .
one set of people who will be delighted to see the pair on stage , whatever they say , is the aardman team of animators in bristol .
" we will be setting up a screen and there will be a party going on til 2-3am , so i hope we do n't disappoint them , " reveals park .
the company has got over the fire at a warehouse in october which destroyed millions of pounds worth of old sets and props .
the latest project for aardman is its first full-length computer-generated animation flushed away , being produced by dreamworks and due out in the uk in december .
it is not the first time aardman has used computer generated imagery - in fact the rabbits floating in the bun-vac in were-rabbit are animated that way .
" we just adore model animation , and we 'll be doing it all our lives , but flushed away involves working with water , and plasticine and water do n't mix , " says park .
the only wallace they also say that wallace and gromit are firmly alive and kicking .
" we are always talking about new wallace and gromit ideas , " insists park .
and they refuse to accept any other wallace but peter sallis , now 85 and in hollywood with them , almost as much a talisman as the two plasticine figures set up today for the cameras .
sallis arrives later for his own interview , admitting he is delighted to be going to the oscars .
he is clearly treated with great affection by his colleagues .
park calls him " irreplaceable " .
so if they do win on sunday , will it change their lives ?
" finally i 'll be ' oscar-winner steve box ' , " muses box .
park would be pleased to have another oscar " so i can throw its weight around at meetings with producers " .
they are playing it down to the last - but while japan is backing miyazaki , the british will be shouting for the quietly spoken lads from the west country .

the two british animators of wallace and gromit : curse of the were-rabbit are in santa monica ready to enjoy the oscar experience , having chosen the bbc for their only pre-awards interview .
box and park have been working on speeches in the event of a win or rather , they would be enjoying it a lot more if they had not brought the british rain and snow with them and park 's luggage had not gone astray at the airport .
" my tux was in the suitcase , " he reveals .
" i 've only got the clothes i 'm standing up in - well sitting in , anyway . "
the pair do have their " good luck " bow ties , which designer paul smith made specially for them to wear at the awards .
" if i win , i could always just go up in my bow tie , " park adds , prompting various quips from box about where to hold the oscar .
park , the winner of three previous oscars -lrb- two for wallace and gromit short films , and one for creature comforts -rrb- is back after 10 years with his fifth nomination .
it is box 's first nomination .
' just ridiculous ' while they are careful not to talk as if they will win , the figures are impressive .
were-rabbit has taken roughly £ 115m -lrb- $ 200m -rrb- worldwide and has 26 wins out of 27 nominations , including the alexander korda award for outstanding british film at the baftas .
the ceremony is absolutely amazing - it 's like being in madame tussauds but they 're all animated nick park " at the baftas we really did n't think we would win because a lot of the films were worthy and meaningful and deep and our film is just ridiculous , " said box , as park chips in : " i think brokeback mountain could have had more gags . "
park is genuine in his tribute to their two rivals for the academy award - tim burton -lrb- corpse bride -rrb- and japanese animation legend hayao miyazaki -lrb- howl 's moving castle -rrb- , calling him " the most respected animator in the world , let alone japan " .
whether they win or lose , they are looking forward to the ceremony .
" the ceremony is absolutely amazing , " says oscar veteran park .
" you are sat there and you see famous faces walking down .
" it 's like being in madame tussauds but they 're all animated .
" and if you are lucky enough to have an oscar in your hand all these celebrities come up to you and shake your hand .
" we 're animators , we 're not used to getting out of our dark studio and meeting real people , let alone glamorous and attractive ones . "
warehouse fire box the newcomer admits to expecting a severe bout of nerves on the night .
" you might have to get up in front of a billion people . "
the two are always coming up with new wallace and gromit ideas park agrees .
" you have got to be ready to not win - and rehearsing wallace 's cheesy smile in case .
but we are determined to try and enjoy it . "
box reveals he " started to panic " when he watched the academy video in which tom hanks advises nominees how to make an impression with their acceptance speech .
they are now working on what they should say if they get their podium moment .
one set of people who will be delighted to see the pair on stage , whatever they say , is the aardman team of animators in bristol .
" we will be setting up a screen and there will be a party going on til 2-3am , so i hope we do n't disappoint them , " reveals park .
the company has got over the fire at a warehouse in october which destroyed millions of pounds worth of old sets and props .
the latest project for aardman is its first full-length computer-generated animation flushed away , being produced by dreamworks and due out in the uk in december .
it is not the first time aardman has used computer generated imagery - in fact the rabbits floating in the bun-vac in were-rabbit are animated that way .
" we just adore model animation , and we 'll be doing it all our lives , but flushed away involves working with water , and plasticine and water do n't mix , " says park .
the only wallace they also say that wallace and gromit are firmly alive and kicking .
" we are always talking about new wallace and gromit ideas , " insists park .
peter sallis is described by the animators as " irreplaceable " and they refuse to accept any other wallace but peter sallis , now 85 and in hollywood with them , almost as much a talisman as the two plasticine figures set up today for the cameras .
sallis arrives later for his own interview , admitting he is delighted to be going to the oscars .
he is clearly treated with great affection by his colleagues .
park calls him " irreplaceable " .
so if they do win on sunday , will it change their lives ?
" finally i 'll be ' oscar-winner steve box ' , " muses box .
park would be pleased to have another oscar " so i can throw its weight around at meetings with producers " .
they are playing it down to the last - but while japan is backing miyazaki , the british will be shouting for the quietly spoken lads from the west country .

" we just adore model animation , and we 'll be doing it all our lives , but flushed away involves working with water , and plasticine and water do n't mix , " says park .
the only wallace they also say that wallace and gromit are firmly alive and kicking .
" we are always talking about new wallace and gromit ideas , " insists park .
peter sallis is described by the animators as " irreplaceable " and they refuse to accept any other wallace but peter sallis , now 85 and in hollywood with them , almost as much a talisman as the two plasticine figures set up today for the cameras .
sallis arrives later for his own interview , admitting he is delighted to be going to the oscars .
he is clearly treated with great affection by his colleagues .
park calls him " irreplaceable " .
so if they do win on sunday , will it change their lives ?
" finally i 'll be ' oscar-winner steve box ' , " muses box .
park would be pleased to have another oscar " so i can throw its weight around at meetings with producers " .
they are playing it down to the last - but while japan is backing miyazaki , the british will be shouting for the quietly spoken lads from the west country .

what is the furore all about ?
what did tony blair say ?
the prime minister said ms jowell had not breached the ministerial code , as her husband had not informed her of a £ 344,000 gift he had received .
how did the whole controversy start ?
ms jowell 's husband david mills is a corporate lawyer who is being investigated by italian prosecutors over claims he was given £ 344,000 in return for helpful testimony in a corruption probe into italian premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi in 1997 .
british police raided mr mills ' office and the home he shares with ms jowell on 10 february on the request of italian prosecutors .
the prosecutors have now passed their information on to a judge in italy who is considering whether there is any case to answer .
mr mills denies absolutely doing anything wrong and denies that the money came from anyone connected with mr berlusconi , but that it came from another client .
why was ms jowell drawn into the controversy ?
it emerged that a loan secured on a house the couple jointly own was paid off with the italian money .
ms jowell and her husband jointly signed the mortgage loan application form which raised £ 408,000 .
ms jowell has categorically denied it was paid off with money from mr berlusconi .
it has also emerged that mr mills believed the italian money was a gift - and there are rules covering gifts to ministers or their spouses in the ministerial code .
what does the ministers ' code say ?
the ministers ' code of conduct says ministers " are advised to provide their permanent secretary with a full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict .
the list should cover not only the minister 's personal interests but those of a spouse or partner ... the same rules apply to the acceptance of gifts " .
did ms jowell follow the rules ?
cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell says in his report on the matter that ms jowell did not become aware until august 2004 that her husband had received the money " he had reasonable grounds to believe was a gift " in september 2000 .
he adds : " she fully accepts that mr mills should have informed her , and if he had , she would of course have reported it to her permanent secretary " .
did the cabinet secretary clear her ?
the cabinet secretary makes clear in his report that it is the prime minister who is the " right and proper person to take a view on matters arising based on the ministerial code " .
so tony blair cleared her ?
yes .
he issued a statement saying : " she is not in breach of her obligations under the ministerial code ...
i have full confidence in her . "
what has been the impact on the couple ?
on saturday they announced they were going to separate , with mr mills ' lawyer saying their marriage had been put under " strain " by the controversy over their finances .
the statement says mr mills " fully accepts responsibility for these pressures and for the situation into which he put his wife , who he knows is entirely blameless in all of this " .
it adds he is " mortified " by the " embarrassment " he has caused her , and the couple hoped their relationship could be restored .
is ms jowell 's job now safe ?
that remains to be seen .
the prime minister 's comments are unlikely to stop the media attention - especially with a decision due soon in italy on whether to prosecute mr mills .
ms jowell will be hoping the announcement that the couple are to separate , with mr mills saying in a statement saying he is " fully responsible " for the pressure currently on his wife , will take the heat out of the story but questions are likely to continue about how much she knew about his business dealings .
relentless press attention can undermine any minister , irrespective of the substance of the claims .
how have politicians reacted ?
conservative mp nigel evans , a member of the culture media and sport select committee , told the bbc he was " absolutely staggered " by the report issued by sir gus o 'donnell and called it " a whitewash " .
he said the ministerial code was " in tatters " unless ms jowell resigned .
labour mp peter kilfoyle , himself a former minister , said these matters were the " very kind of things that we excoriated the tories for in the 1990s .
and i think it damages government and it damages politics . "
but health minister rosie winterton said : " i think tessa is a minister of the highest integrity , a very effective minister .
and i hope that it will be the end of the matter . "
what are the implications for the future ?
it seems pressure to update the ministerial code is growing .
chairman of the committee on standards in public life sir alistair graham said the cabinet secretary was not the right person to investigate ms jowell 's conduct .
he said the situation showed that the current regulations were " pretty bankrupt " .

what is the furore all about ?
what did tony blair say ?
the prime minister said ms jowell had not breached the ministerial code , as her husband had not informed her of a £ 344,000 gift he had received .
how did the whole controversy start ?
ms jowell 's husband david mills is a corporate lawyer who is being investigated by italian prosecutors over claims he was given £ 344,000 in return for helpful testimony in a corruption probe into italian premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi in 1997 .
british police raided mr mills ' office and the home he shares with ms jowell on 10 february on the request of italian prosecutors .
the prosecutors have now passed their information on to a judge in italy who is considering whether there is any case to answer .
mr mills denies absolutely doing anything wrong and denies that the money came from anyone connected with mr berlusconi , but that it came from another client .
why was ms jowell drawn into the controversy ?
it emerged that a loan secured on a house the couple jointly own was paid off with the italian money .
ms jowell and her husband jointly signed the mortgage loan application form which raised £ 408,000 .
ms jowell has categorically denied it was paid off with money from mr berlusconi .
it has also emerged that mr mills believed the italian money was a gift - and there are rules covering gifts to ministers or their spouses in the ministerial code .
what does the ministers ' code say ?
the ministers ' code of conduct says ministers " are advised to provide their permanent secretary with a full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict .
the list should cover not only the minister 's personal interests but those of a spouse or partner ... the same rules apply to the acceptance of gifts " .
did ms jowell follow the rules ?
cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell says in his report on the matter that ms jowell did not become aware until august 2004 that her husband had received the money " he had reasonable grounds to believe was a gift " in september 2000 .
he adds : " she fully accepts that mr mills should have informed her , and if he had , she would of course have reported it to her permanent secretary " .
did the cabinet secretary clear her ?
the cabinet secretary makes clear in his report that it is the prime minister who is the " right and proper person to take a view on matters arising based on the ministerial code " .
so tony blair cleared her ?
yes .
he issued a statement saying : " she is not in breach of her obligations under the ministerial code ...
i have full confidence in her . "
what has been the impact on the couple ?
on saturday they announced they were going to separate , with mr mills ' lawyer saying their marriage had been put under " strain " by the controversy over their finances .
the statement says mr mills " fully accepts responsibility for these pressures and for the situation into which he put his wife , who he knows is entirely blameless in all of this " .
it adds he is " mortified " by the " embarrassment " he has caused her , and the couple hoped their relationship could be restored .
is ms jowell 's job now safe ?
that remains to be seen .
the prime minister 's comments are unlikely to stop the media attention - especially with a decision due soon in italy on whether to prosecute mr mills .
ms jowell will be hoping the announcement that the couple are to separate , with mr mills saying in a statement saying he is " fully responsible " for the pressure currently on his wife , will take the heat out of the story but questions are likely to continue about how much she knew about his business dealings .
relentless press attention can undermine any minister , irrespective of the substance of the claims .
how have politicians reacted ?
conservative mp nigel evans , a member of the culture media and sport select committee , told the bbc he was " absolutely staggered " by the report issued by sir gus o 'donnell and called it " a whitewash " .
he said the ministerial code was " in tatters " unless ms jowell resigned .
labour mp peter kilfoyle , himself a former minister , said these matters were the " very kind of things that we excoriated the tories for in the 1990s .
and i think it damages government and it damages politics . "
but health minister rosie winterton said : " i think tessa is a minister of the highest integrity , a very effective minister .
and i hope that it will be the end of the matter . "
what are the implications for the future ?
it seems pressure to update the ministerial code is growing .
chairman of the committee on standards in public life sir alistair graham said the cabinet secretary was not the right person to investigate ms jowell 's conduct .
he said the situation showed that the current regulations were " pretty bankrupt " .

what is the furore all about ?
what did tony blair say ?
the prime minister said ms jowell had not breached the ministerial code , as her husband had not informed her of a £ 344,000 gift he had received .
how did the whole controversy start ?
ms jowell 's husband david mills is a corporate lawyer who is being investigated by italian prosecutors over claims he was given £ 344,000 in return for helpful testimony in a corruption probe into italian premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi in 1997 .
british police raided mr mills ' office and the home he shares with ms jowell on 10 february on the request of italian prosecutors .
the prosecutors have now passed their information on to a judge in italy who is considering whether there is any case to answer .
mr mills denies absolutely doing anything wrong and denies that the money came from anyone connected with mr berlusconi , but that it came from another client .
why was ms jowell drawn into the controversy ?
it emerged that a loan secured on a house the couple jointly own was paid off with the italian money .
ms jowell and her husband jointly signed the mortgage loan application form which raised £ 408,000 .
ms jowell has categorically denied it was paid off with money from mr berlusconi .
it has also emerged that mr mills believed the italian money was a gift - and there are rules covering gifts to ministers or their spouses in the ministerial code .
what does the ministers ' code say ?
the ministers ' code of conduct says ministers " are advised to provide their permanent secretary with a full list in writing of all interests which might be thought to give rise to a conflict .
the list should cover not only the minister 's personal interests but those of a spouse or partner ... the same rules apply to the acceptance of gifts " .
did ms jowell follow the rules ?
cabinet secretary sir gus o 'donnell says in his report on the matter that ms jowell did not become aware until august 2004 that her husband had received the money " he had reasonable grounds to believe was a gift " in september 2000 .
he adds : " she fully accepts that mr mills should have informed her , and if he had , she would of course have reported it to her permanent secretary " .
did the cabinet secretary clear her ?
the cabinet secretary makes clear in his report that it is the prime minister who is the " right and proper person to take a view on matters arising based on the ministerial code " .
so tony blair cleared her ?
yes .
he issued a statement saying : " she is not in breach of her obligations under the ministerial code ...
i have full confidence in her . "
what has been the impact on the couple ?
on saturday they announced they were going to separate , with mr mills ' lawyer saying their marriage had been put under " strain " by the controversy over their finances .
the statement says mr mills " fully accepts responsibility for these pressures and for the situation into which he put his wife , who he knows is entirely blameless in all of this " .
it adds he is " mortified " by the " embarrassment " he has caused her , and the couple hoped their relationship could be restored .
is ms jowell 's job now safe ?
that remains to be seen .
the prime minister 's comments are unlikely to stop the media attention - especially with a decision due soon in italy on whether to prosecute mr mills .
ms jowell will be hoping the announcement that the couple are to separate , with mr mills saying in a statement saying he is " fully responsible " for the pressure currently on his wife , will take the heat out of the story but questions are likely to continue about how much she knew about his business dealings .
relentless press attention can undermine any minister , irrespective of the substance of the claims .
how have politicians reacted ?
conservative mp nigel evans , a member of the culture media and sport select committee , told the bbc he was " absolutely staggered " by the report issued by sir gus o 'donnell and called it " a whitewash " .
he said the ministerial code was " in tatters " unless ms jowell resigned .
labour mp peter kilfoyle , himself a former minister , said these matters were the " very kind of things that we excoriated the tories for in the 1990s .
and i think it damages government and it damages politics . "
but health minister rosie winterton said : " i think tessa is a minister of the highest integrity , a very effective minister .
and i hope that it will be the end of the matter . "
what are the implications for the future ?
it seems pressure to update the ministerial code is growing .
chairman of the committee on standards in public life sir alistair graham said the cabinet secretary was not the right person to investigate ms jowell 's conduct .
he said the situation showed that the current regulations were " pretty bankrupt " .

in a commons statement , mr clarke gave chief constables , police authorities and councils until july to object .
he said many of england and wales ' 43 forces should merge by april 2007 .
north wales police authority expressed disappointment .
the gwent authority said it now accepted mr clarke had the ability to deliver the reorganisation .
merger deadline the merger of wales ' four forces - south wales , dyfed-powys , north wales and gwent - have been mooted since the publication of a hm inspectorate of constabulary -lrb- hmic -rrb- report in september 2005 .
the report proposed sweeping changes to the make-up of police forces in wales and england stating that the current structure was " no longer fit for purpose " .
neighbourhood policing would inevitably suffer under an all-wales police force ian roberts , north wales police authority earlier this year , mr clarke announced that the uk government planned the merge wales ' four forces and gave police chiefs until 24 february to agree .
the deadline passed with all four police welsh authorities opposing the plans over issues such as funding and community policing .
but in his statement on friday , mr clarke said : " the current 43 force structure in england and wales has been in place for some 30 years .
" much has changed in society since then and it is my responsibility as home secretary to ensure that the arrangements for policing are such that the current challenges can be tackled effectively .
wales will now have a single force by april next year " for cheshire and merseyside and the forces in the north east , west midlands and wales , i am satisfied ... that it would be in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of policing for the forces in each of these areas to merge . "
he gave police authorities , local authorities and chief constables until 2 july to submit objections .
following the announcement , north wales police authority accused the uk government of waging a " cynical misinformation " campaign over the merger plans .
ian roberts , chair of the authority , said : " we are extremely disappointed that charles clarke has decided to ignore the wishes of the people of north wales .
" they have still failed to answer fundamentally important questions about many crucial issues including funding and accountability .
however , geraint price thomas , chairman of gwent police authority and spokesman for police authorities wales , who has previously voiced opposition to the merger , said he now accepted it would happen eventually .
" we 're realistic , we have to accept that charles clarke has the ability to deliver this , and at the end of the day what is important is a better and effective police service for the welsh people " .
but he said the merger process to date had been " flawed " .
" we believe that we do now have to get in there and explain to the home office the practicalities as to what is actually needed to deliver an effective reorganisation . "

he is only the fourth us leader to visit pakistan , and president pervez musharraf has been in office to receive two of them .
but mr bush 's partner in the four-year-old " war on terror " is embattled on several fronts .
the entire political opposition is up in arms , refusing to participate in the state banquet planned for mr bush on 4 march .
not only that , but opposition leaders seem determined to turn the anti-cartoon protests into some kind of a public movement against general musharraf .
' relentless pressure ' there is seething anger in large parts of pakistan 's northern province of nwfp over the ongoing military operation against foreign and local militants in the tribal belt along pakistan 's border with afghanistan .
he must be hoping that mr bush chooses his words carefully when he raises the issue of tackling extremism there is relentless pressure from across the border as well , with the afghan government openly accusing pakistan of harbouring insurgents in its border areas .
even gen musharraf 's repeated claim that pakistan had broken al-qaeda 's back was violently challenged as a us diplomat was killed in a highly organised bomb attack in karachi a day before mr bush 's arrival .
to top it all off , us officials said in unambiguous terms that there was no possibility of the us extending civil nuclear co-operation to pakistan to match a similar deal signed with india .
the backdrop has led many analysts to wonder what pakistan - and gen musharraf in particular - hopes to gain from this visit .
gen musharraf would no doubt like something more than the expected pat on the back from his us counterpart .
' cash injection ' some of his expectations were voiced in a recent interview with the bbc in which he urged mr bush to throw his weight behind the faltering peace process over kashmir .
clashes between troops and militants have sparked domestic opposition " i expect ... his weight , his voice , pressurising all three groups - me , the indians and kashmiris - to resolve the dispute , " he told the bbc .
similarly , he must be hoping that mr bush chooses his words carefully when he raises the issue of tackling extremism in pakistan 's tribal belt .
but leading defence analyst hasan askar rizvi says that while these political issues are no doubt important , the real benefits pakistan has reaped from its alliance with the us are on the economic front .
financial analysts say more than 75 % of the money fuelling the current unprecedented bull run in pakistani stock markets is from us investors .
in the run up to mr bush 's visit , pakistani papers were full of columns wondering if the visit could mean a massive cash injection in the pakistan economy .
how likely , then , that mr bush will live up to these expectations ?
us backing barring kashmir , where america 's new strategic partnership with india is likely to make mr bush tread very carefully , analysts agree that gen musharraf may get pretty much what he is hoping for .
according to mr rizvi , the us may be keen to demonstrate that its policies are geared towards helping the common pakistani and not just propping up the military .
this could well mean a cash injection into social sectors such as health and education to give some concrete meaning to mr bush 's visit .
this , of course , is not to say that a mere pat on the back will not be deemed sufficient by the pakistani ruler .
the opposition 's decision to stay away from saturday 's state banquet was based on mr bush 's recent remarks that he agreed with gen musharraf 's vision for democracy .
the importance of the us leadership 's goodwill for pakistani politicians can hardly be overstated that involves a continuing of the dominant role of the army in which gen musharraf holds onto his military role as head of the army .
a declaration of continued us support for his policies could go a long way in helping gen musharraf deal with a resurgent opposition .
mr bush is to remain in office till 2008 , a year after gen musharraf is required to seek a fresh vote from the parliament .
the importance of the us leadership 's goodwill for pakistani politicians can hardly be overstated - the latest evidence being the opposition 's decision not to hold any demonstrations on 4 march , the day he spends in pakistan .
in fact , even as they stay away from the state banquet in mr bush 's honour , many among the opposition will be hoping that he understands their political compulsions in doing so .
