" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .
with schröder everything was much more pompous .
i think germans like this sort of modesty , " he said . economic upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first woman chancellor was sworn into office on nov .
22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .
rubbing blood over skin results in a similar metallic smell based on the same scent molecules , as blood also contains iron atoms . " that humans can ' smell ' iron can be interpreted as a sense for the smell of blood , " glindemann said .
" early humans were thus probably able to track down wounded prey or tribe members . " based on this new knowledge , medical researchers should be able to further develop iron tests for skin , blood and tissues to identify specific " fingerprints " of volatile scent molecules as markers for individual body odor , oxidative stress and diseases . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists concerned about rise in creationist belief after recent comments by a state education minister , some german biologists have expressed concern over an increase in the influence of creationists in the country .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .

" in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 19.11.2006 germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's staatsgalerie museum was asked to hand over franz marc 's " little blue horses " the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .
museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

eu officials said that enhanced governance , poverty reduction , policy coherence and establishing a business framework for eu member states to aspire to , all form part of their core strategy on africa . world donors on wednesday pledged not to impose their ideas on governance and reform on poor african countries but to help them make their own visions come true . " change from the inside " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desmond tutu is an anglican archbishop in south africa " it is for them to lead and for us to support , not for any outsiders to impose , " united nations deputy general secretary mark malloch brown told the eu-africa conference in brussels . his stance was echoed by world bank president paul wolfowitz , who said that " ultimate change can only come from the inside . " european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel was keen to stress that not all the news from africa is bad . " the growth rate for 2006 will be around 6 percent for the african continent , so it just goes to show africa is moving .
africans want to take stock of their governance , " he said . eu pledge to double support by 2010 european union commission president jose manuel barroso called on the bloc 's member states to deliver on their pledges to double eu aid to africa by 2010 .
the continent currently receives 15 billion euros per year from the european union , which is around 60 percent of overall eu development assistance . barroso said that the eu would reduce import quotas and tariffs for african countries by 2009 . " the current downward trend in our trade is unacceptable , " he added .
" we are partners now .

" we do have to present a united front and work together in order to break this vicious inhuman circle .
we have to do more , we have to do what we do better , and we have to act more quickly , " said european development commissioner louis michel . the european commission argued that development requires an integrated , cross-disciplinary approach . concerns about china dismissed as for china , the eu is was not afraid of its increasing influence in africa , said michel .
beijing last weekend signed trade deals worth some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- with african nations without linking them to democratic reforms and human rights , prompting european fears that the eu could lose its influence in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have to do more , " said eu commissioner louis michel of belgium meanwhile , international aid groups participating in the conference said the eu was ignoring the role big business was playing in corruption in africa . they also slammed the world bank and the international monetary fund for a failure to fight worldwide poverty and create sustainable development . cultural backdrop brussels was also host to a series of events focused on africa , all designed to highlight africa 's achievements .
the so-called european development days include an african comic strip exhibition , african film festival , a development village , a fashion show and a media debate involving african and european journalists . the commissioner hopes the event will become annual , and said that raising public awareness is key to turning africa around . " it 's only by making sure that everyone becomes more aware of these problems that we can move forward and turn africa into a forward looking and promising continent , " michel said . with un secretary general kofi annan in the final weeks of his tenure , officials in brussels are concerned africa will drop off the global agenda . this week 's africa summit 's focus is a concerted effort to try and make sure that does n't happen . nina maria potts -lrb- sj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier clinches debt repayment deal on north africa tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's tour of north africa is aimed at preparing germany for its presidency of the eu and the group of eight industrialized countries in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 19.11.2006 germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's staatsgalerie museum was asked to hand over franz marc 's " little blue horses " the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .
museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

" we have set our target to stay near the top going into the winter break and this win helps us , " said bayern captain oliver kahn .
" as long as we are up there - and we are only three points off the top - we can think about retaining our title . " bremen , who face chelsea in the champions league on wednesday , made it just one point out of six with a disappointing 2-2 draw at alemannia aachen . stuttgart loss puts schalke out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich captain oliver kahn has his sights on the title the loss for stuttgart means schalke 04 become the seventh different team to lead the 18-strong bundesliga this season following a 4-2 win over energie cottbus on saturday . " we had a two-goal lead and then stopped playing .
we let their long balls put us under pressure , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .

the young star needed just eight minutes to produce a clinical finish past oliver kahn . stuttgart had been dreaming of their first win in munich since september 1999 , but bayern had other ideas and equalized in the 27th minute through a roy makaay header .
peruvian international claudio pizarro then put bayern ahead ten minutes later tapping in from close range after a great cross from marc van bommel . bayern held on and introduced german international midfielder sebastian deisler in the final minute for his first appearance since march when a cruciate ligament injury ended his season . " you could see that stuttgart deserve to be up at the top .
we went behind but the good thing was that the goal was so early on , " magath explained .

" we wanted the three points but aachen were too strong for that , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" it was a great game that had everything for the neutral . " goals from hamit altintop and former german international kevin kuranyi put schalke two goals up after 15 minutes against cottbus but sergiu radu scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 28 , 31 -rrb- to peg them back . christian pander put schalke back in front and levan kobiaschvili scored another as they moved to the summit . pointless hamburg playing for pride bildunterschrift : neither hamburg nor mainz managed to score in saturday 's game elsewhere , hamburg boss thomas doll is still searching for some relief after a 0-0 draw with bottom side mainz .

" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .
with schröder everything was much more pompous .
i think germans like this sort of modesty , " he said . economic upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first woman chancellor was sworn into office on nov .
22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

rich germans are swelling swiss coffers with their hoarded millions wealthy german citizens hold more than 800 billion swiss francs -lrb- 516 billion euros , $ 645 billion -rrb- in bank accounts in neighboring switzerland mainly to avoid taxation , a swiss business weekly reported this week . the magazine cash said its figures were based on the latest banking data released by the swiss central bank . new deposits during the third quarter amounted to 41.9 billion swiss francs at the country 's largest bank , ubs , and 31 billion swiss francs at credit suisse .
one-third of those amounts came from germany , it added . about one-quarter of the deposits managed by banks in switzerland come from german company sell-offs or management bonuses paid out in germany , cash estimated . swiss banking preferred by rich germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria is so last year ; germans prefer switzerland now the weekly publication cited data from german tax authorities which indicated that small savers tend to prefer offshore banking in austria or luxembourg , while wealthy germans turned to switzerland . since july last year , switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - levies a withholding tax on interest earned by eu residents on their swiss accounts .
the revenue is mainly paid back to eu governments . the agreement between the eu , including germany , and switzerland was part of a broader attempt to discourage tax evasion as capital flows more freely between european nations . swiss banking secrecy laws forbid the release of transaction details to authorities , unless it is part of a criminal investigation .

" we had a two-goal lead and then stopped playing .
we let their long balls put us under pressure , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" fortunately we scored another two goals and are delighted to be top of the table , although there is a long way to go yet .

the young star needed just eight minutes to produce a clinical finish past oliver kahn . stuttgart had been dreaming of their first win in munich since september 1999 , but bayern had other ideas and equalized in the 27th minute through a roy makaay header .
peruvian international claudio pizarro then put bayern ahead ten minutes later tapping in from close range after a great cross from marc van bommel . bayern held on and introduced german international midfielder sebastian deisler in the final minute for his first appearance since march when a cruciate ligament injury ended his season . " you could see that stuttgart deserve to be up at the top .
we went behind but the good thing was that the goal was so early on , " magath explained .
" the team then took the game by the scruff of the neck and deserved to win 2-1 .

" we wanted the three points but aachen were too strong for that , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" it was a great game that had everything for the neutral .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

eu officials said that enhanced governance , poverty reduction , policy coherence and establishing a business framework for eu member states to aspire to , all form part of their core strategy on africa . world donors on wednesday pledged not to impose their ideas on governance and reform on poor african countries but to help them make their own visions come true . " change from the inside " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desmond tutu is an anglican archbishop in south africa " it is for them to lead and for us to support , not for any outsiders to impose , " united nations deputy general secretary mark malloch brown told the eu-africa conference in brussels . his stance was echoed by world bank president paul wolfowitz , who said that " ultimate change can only come from the inside . " european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel was keen to stress that not all the news from africa is bad . " the growth rate for 2006 will be around 6 percent for the african continent , so it just goes to show africa is moving .
africans want to take stock of their governance , " he said . eu pledge to double support by 2010 european union commission president jose manuel barroso called on the bloc 's member states to deliver on their pledges to double eu aid to africa by 2010 .
the continent currently receives 15 billion euros per year from the european union , which is around 60 percent of overall eu development assistance . barroso said that the eu would reduce import quotas and tariffs for african countries by 2009 . " the current downward trend in our trade is unacceptable , " he added .
" we are partners now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu still wants to maintain influence in africa in 2007 , an eu-africa summit will be held in lisbon to foster existing ties . a boost for business relations the first eu-africa business forum provided an opportunity to boost private sector development and encourage european investors to consider opportunities in africa . " we do have to present a united front and work together in order to break this vicious inhuman circle .
we have to do more , we have to do what we do better , and we have to act more quickly , " said european development commissioner louis michel . the european commission argued that development requires an integrated , cross-disciplinary approach . concerns about china dismissed as for china , the eu is was not afraid of its increasing influence in africa , said michel .
beijing last weekend signed trade deals worth some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- with african nations without linking them to democratic reforms and human rights , prompting european fears that the eu could lose its influence in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have to do more , " said eu commissioner louis michel of belgium meanwhile , international aid groups participating in the conference said the eu was ignoring the role big business was playing in corruption in africa . they also slammed the world bank and the international monetary fund for a failure to fight worldwide poverty and create sustainable development . cultural backdrop brussels was also host to a series of events focused on africa , all designed to highlight africa 's achievements .
the so-called european development days include an african comic strip exhibition , african film festival , a development village , a fashion show and a media debate involving african and european journalists . the commissioner hopes the event will become annual , and said that raising public awareness is key to turning africa around . " it 's only by making sure that everyone becomes more aware of these problems that we can move forward and turn africa into a forward looking and promising continent , " michel said . with un secretary general kofi annan in the final weeks of his tenure , officials in brussels are concerned africa will drop off the global agenda . this week 's africa summit 's focus is a concerted effort to try and make sure that does n't happen . nina maria potts -lrb- sj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier clinches debt repayment deal on north africa tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's tour of north africa is aimed at preparing germany for its presidency of the eu and the group of eight industrialized countries in january .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .

two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 .

statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted .

in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .

" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .
with schröder everything was much more pompous .
i think germans like this sort of modesty , " he said . economic upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first woman chancellor was sworn into office on nov .
22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .
with schröder everything was much more pompous .
i think germans like this sort of modesty , " he said . economic upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first woman chancellor was sworn into office on nov .
22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

" we have set our target to stay near the top going into the winter break and this win helps us , " said bayern captain oliver kahn .
" as long as we are up there - and we are only three points off the top - we can think about retaining our title . " bremen , who face chelsea in the champions league on wednesday , made it just one point out of six with a disappointing 2-2 draw at alemannia aachen . stuttgart loss puts schalke out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich captain oliver kahn has his sights on the title the loss for stuttgart means schalke 04 become the seventh different team to lead the 18-strong bundesliga this season following a 4-2 win over energie cottbus on saturday . " we had a two-goal lead and then stopped playing .
we let their long balls put us under pressure , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .

peruvian international claudio pizarro then put bayern ahead ten minutes later tapping in from close range after a great cross from marc van bommel . bayern held on and introduced german international midfielder sebastian deisler in the final minute for his first appearance since march when a cruciate ligament injury ended his season .

" we wanted the three points but aachen were too strong for that , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" it was a great game that had everything for the neutral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 19.11.2006 germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's staatsgalerie museum was asked to hand over franz marc 's " little blue horses " the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .
museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

" we have set our target to stay near the top going into the winter break and this win helps us , " said bayern captain oliver kahn .
" as long as we are up there - and we are only three points off the top - we can think about retaining our title . " bremen , who face chelsea in the champions league on wednesday , made it just one point out of six with a disappointing 2-2 draw at alemannia aachen . stuttgart loss puts schalke out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich captain oliver kahn has his sights on the title the loss for stuttgart means schalke 04 become the seventh different team to lead the 18-strong bundesliga this season following a 4-2 win over energie cottbus on saturday . " we had a two-goal lead and then stopped playing .
we let their long balls put us under pressure , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" fortunately we scored another two goals and are delighted to be top of the table , although there is a long way to go yet . " schalke , out of the uefa cup and domestic cup , are three points ahead of bayern after three successive wins . gomez shines early bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian pander scored one of four goals for schalke before the top of the table clash , bayern president franz beckenbauer had singled out stuttgart 's german under-21 international forward mario gomez as a talent for the future .
the young star needed just eight minutes to produce a clinical finish past oliver kahn . stuttgart had been dreaming of their first win in munich since september 1999 , but bayern had other ideas and equalized in the 27th minute through a roy makaay header .
peruvian international claudio pizarro then put bayern ahead ten minutes later tapping in from close range after a great cross from marc van bommel . bayern held on and introduced german international midfielder sebastian deisler in the final minute for his first appearance since march when a cruciate ligament injury ended his season . " you could see that stuttgart deserve to be up at the top .
we went behind but the good thing was that the goal was so early on , " magath explained .
" the team then took the game by the scruff of the neck and deserved to win 2-1 .
we can go into the weekend very happy with ourselves . " bremen settle for final-quarter tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose tied up the game in the 79th minute after losing 3-1 to borussia dortmund last weekend bremen were keen to bounce back but had to settle for a point against aachen with miroslav klose salvaging a 2-2 tie with a 79th minute equalizer . it was hardly a confidence booster ahead of wednesday 's crucial champions league match with chelsea and they slip to third , two points behind schalke . " we wanted the three points but aachen were too strong for that , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" it was a great game that had everything for the neutral . " goals from hamit altintop and former german international kevin kuranyi put schalke two goals up after 15 minutes against cottbus but sergiu radu scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 28 , 31 -rrb- to peg them back . christian pander put schalke back in front and levan kobiaschvili scored another as they moved to the summit . pointless hamburg playing for pride bildunterschrift : neither hamburg nor mainz managed to score in saturday 's game elsewhere , hamburg boss thomas doll is still searching for some relief after a 0-0 draw with bottom side mainz .
hamburg are third from bottom of the table and their champions league tie against arsenal on tuesday is an unwanted distraction . hamburg have yet to collect a point in europe 's flagship competition and are playing for pride as they can not even qualify for the consolation uefa cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bundesliga leaders vfb stuttgart travel to champions bayern munich saturday looking for a fifth straight win in the top match this weekend .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .
rubbing blood over skin results in a similar metallic smell based on the same scent molecules , as blood also contains iron atoms . " that humans can ' smell ' iron can be interpreted as a sense for the smell of blood , " glindemann said .
" early humans were thus probably able to track down wounded prey or tribe members . " based on this new knowledge , medical researchers should be able to further develop iron tests for skin , blood and tissues to identify specific " fingerprints " of volatile scent molecules as markers for individual body odor , oxidative stress and diseases . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists concerned about rise in creationist belief after recent comments by a state education minister , some german biologists have expressed concern over an increase in the influence of creationists in the country .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .
rubbing blood over skin results in a similar metallic smell based on the same scent molecules , as blood also contains iron atoms . " that humans can ' smell ' iron can be interpreted as a sense for the smell of blood , " glindemann said .
" early humans were thus probably able to track down wounded prey or tribe members . " based on this new knowledge , medical researchers should be able to further develop iron tests for skin , blood and tissues to identify specific " fingerprints " of volatile scent molecules as markers for individual body odor , oxidative stress and diseases . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists concerned about rise in creationist belief after recent comments by a state education minister , some german biologists have expressed concern over an increase in the influence of creationists in the country .

eu officials said that enhanced governance , poverty reduction , policy coherence and establishing a business framework for eu member states to aspire to , all form part of their core strategy on africa . world donors on wednesday pledged not to impose their ideas on governance and reform on poor african countries but to help them make their own visions come true . " change from the inside " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desmond tutu is an anglican archbishop in south africa " it is for them to lead and for us to support , not for any outsiders to impose , " united nations deputy general secretary mark malloch brown told the eu-africa conference in brussels . his stance was echoed by world bank president paul wolfowitz , who said that " ultimate change can only come from the inside . " european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel was keen to stress that not all the news from africa is bad . " the growth rate for 2006 will be around 6 percent for the african continent , so it just goes to show africa is moving .
africans want to take stock of their governance , " he said . eu pledge to double support by 2010 european union commission president jose manuel barroso called on the bloc 's member states to deliver on their pledges to double eu aid to africa by 2010 .
the continent currently receives 15 billion euros per year from the european union , which is around 60 percent of overall eu development assistance . barroso said that the eu would reduce import quotas and tariffs for african countries by 2009 . " the current downward trend in our trade is unacceptable , " he added .
" we are partners now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu still wants to maintain influence in africa in 2007 , an eu-africa summit will be held in lisbon to foster existing ties . a boost for business relations the first eu-africa business forum provided an opportunity to boost private sector development and encourage european investors to consider opportunities in africa . " we do have to present a united front and work together in order to break this vicious inhuman circle .
we have to do more , we have to do what we do better , and we have to act more quickly , " said european development commissioner louis michel . the european commission argued that development requires an integrated , cross-disciplinary approach . concerns about china dismissed as for china , the eu is was not afraid of its increasing influence in africa , said michel .
beijing last weekend signed trade deals worth some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- with african nations without linking them to democratic reforms and human rights , prompting european fears that the eu could lose its influence in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have to do more , " said eu commissioner louis michel of belgium meanwhile , international aid groups participating in the conference said the eu was ignoring the role big business was playing in corruption in africa . they also slammed the world bank and the international monetary fund for a failure to fight worldwide poverty and create sustainable development . cultural backdrop brussels was also host to a series of events focused on africa , all designed to highlight africa 's achievements .
the so-called european development days include an african comic strip exhibition , african film festival , a development village , a fashion show and a media debate involving african and european journalists . the commissioner hopes the event will become annual , and said that raising public awareness is key to turning africa around . " it 's only by making sure that everyone becomes more aware of these problems that we can move forward and turn africa into a forward looking and promising continent , " michel said . with un secretary general kofi annan in the final weeks of his tenure , officials in brussels are concerned africa will drop off the global agenda . this week 's africa summit 's focus is a concerted effort to try and make sure that does n't happen . nina maria potts -lrb- sj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier clinches debt repayment deal on north africa tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's tour of north africa is aimed at preparing germany for its presidency of the eu and the group of eight industrialized countries in january .

eu officials said that enhanced governance , poverty reduction , policy coherence and establishing a business framework for eu member states to aspire to , all form part of their core strategy on africa . world donors on wednesday pledged not to impose their ideas on governance and reform on poor african countries but to help them make their own visions come true . " change from the inside " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : desmond tutu is an anglican archbishop in south africa " it is for them to lead and for us to support , not for any outsiders to impose , " united nations deputy general secretary mark malloch brown told the eu-africa conference in brussels . his stance was echoed by world bank president paul wolfowitz , who said that " ultimate change can only come from the inside . " european commissioner for development and humanitarian aid louis michel was keen to stress that not all the news from africa is bad . " the growth rate for 2006 will be around 6 percent for the african continent , so it just goes to show africa is moving .
africans want to take stock of their governance , " he said . eu pledge to double support by 2010 european union commission president jose manuel barroso called on the bloc 's member states to deliver on their pledges to double eu aid to africa by 2010 .
the continent currently receives 15 billion euros per year from the european union , which is around 60 percent of overall eu development assistance . barroso said that the eu would reduce import quotas and tariffs for african countries by 2009 . " the current downward trend in our trade is unacceptable , " he added .
" we are partners now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu still wants to maintain influence in africa in 2007 , an eu-africa summit will be held in lisbon to foster existing ties . a boost for business relations the first eu-africa business forum provided an opportunity to boost private sector development and encourage european investors to consider opportunities in africa . " we do have to present a united front and work together in order to break this vicious inhuman circle .
we have to do more , we have to do what we do better , and we have to act more quickly , " said european development commissioner louis michel . the european commission argued that development requires an integrated , cross-disciplinary approach . concerns about china dismissed as for china , the eu is was not afraid of its increasing influence in africa , said michel .
beijing last weekend signed trade deals worth some 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- with african nations without linking them to democratic reforms and human rights , prompting european fears that the eu could lose its influence in africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have to do more , " said eu commissioner louis michel of belgium meanwhile , international aid groups participating in the conference said the eu was ignoring the role big business was playing in corruption in africa . they also slammed the world bank and the international monetary fund for a failure to fight worldwide poverty and create sustainable development . cultural backdrop brussels was also host to a series of events focused on africa , all designed to highlight africa 's achievements .
the so-called european development days include an african comic strip exhibition , african film festival , a development village , a fashion show and a media debate involving african and european journalists . the commissioner hopes the event will become annual , and said that raising public awareness is key to turning africa around . " it 's only by making sure that everyone becomes more aware of these problems that we can move forward and turn africa into a forward looking and promising continent , " michel said . with un secretary general kofi annan in the final weeks of his tenure , officials in brussels are concerned africa will drop off the global agenda . this week 's africa summit 's focus is a concerted effort to try and make sure that does n't happen . nina maria potts -lrb- sj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier clinches debt repayment deal on north africa tour german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's tour of north africa is aimed at preparing germany for its presidency of the eu and the group of eight industrialized countries in january .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .
rubbing blood over skin results in a similar metallic smell based on the same scent molecules , as blood also contains iron atoms . " that humans can ' smell ' iron can be interpreted as a sense for the smell of blood , " glindemann said .
" early humans were thus probably able to track down wounded prey or tribe members . " based on this new knowledge , medical researchers should be able to further develop iron tests for skin , blood and tissues to identify specific " fingerprints " of volatile scent molecules as markers for individual body odor , oxidative stress and diseases . dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientists concerned about rise in creationist belief after recent comments by a state education minister , some german biologists have expressed concern over an increase in the influence of creationists in the country .

a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .
rubbing blood over skin results in a similar metallic smell based on the same scent molecules , as blood also contains iron atoms . " that humans can ' smell ' iron can be interpreted as a sense for the smell of blood , " glindemann said .

rich germans are swelling swiss coffers with their hoarded millions wealthy german citizens hold more than 800 billion swiss francs -lrb- 516 billion euros , $ 645 billion -rrb- in bank accounts in neighboring switzerland mainly to avoid taxation , a swiss business weekly reported this week . the magazine cash said its figures were based on the latest banking data released by the swiss central bank . new deposits during the third quarter amounted to 41.9 billion swiss francs at the country 's largest bank , ubs , and 31 billion swiss francs at credit suisse .
one-third of those amounts came from germany , it added . about one-quarter of the deposits managed by banks in switzerland come from german company sell-offs or management bonuses paid out in germany , cash estimated . swiss banking preferred by rich germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria is so last year ; germans prefer switzerland now the weekly publication cited data from german tax authorities which indicated that small savers tend to prefer offshore banking in austria or luxembourg , while wealthy germans turned to switzerland . since july last year , switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - levies a withholding tax on interest earned by eu residents on their swiss accounts .

" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .

22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 19.11.2006 germany aims for better restitution process for nazi-looted art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's staatsgalerie museum was asked to hand over franz marc 's " little blue horses " the german government has invited museum directors and legal experts to berlin on monday to discuss claims for art bought or seized by the nazis .
museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

" we have set our target to stay near the top going into the winter break and this win helps us , " said bayern captain oliver kahn .
" as long as we are up there - and we are only three points off the top - we can think about retaining our title . " bremen , who face chelsea in the champions league on wednesday , made it just one point out of six with a disappointing 2-2 draw at alemannia aachen . stuttgart loss puts schalke out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich captain oliver kahn has his sights on the title the loss for stuttgart means schalke 04 become the seventh different team to lead the 18-strong bundesliga this season following a 4-2 win over energie cottbus on saturday . " we had a two-goal lead and then stopped playing .
we let their long balls put us under pressure , " said schalke coach mirko slomka .
" fortunately we scored another two goals and are delighted to be top of the table , although there is a long way to go yet . " schalke , out of the uefa cup and domestic cup , are three points ahead of bayern after three successive wins . gomez shines early bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian pander scored one of four goals for schalke before the top of the table clash , bayern president franz beckenbauer had singled out stuttgart 's german under-21 international forward mario gomez as a talent for the future .
the young star needed just eight minutes to produce a clinical finish past oliver kahn . stuttgart had been dreaming of their first win in munich since september 1999 , but bayern had other ideas and equalized in the 27th minute through a roy makaay header .
peruvian international claudio pizarro then put bayern ahead ten minutes later tapping in from close range after a great cross from marc van bommel . bayern held on and introduced german international midfielder sebastian deisler in the final minute for his first appearance since march when a cruciate ligament injury ended his season . " you could see that stuttgart deserve to be up at the top .
we went behind but the good thing was that the goal was so early on , " magath explained .
" the team then took the game by the scruff of the neck and deserved to win 2-1 .
we can go into the weekend very happy with ourselves . " bremen settle for final-quarter tie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose tied up the game in the 79th minute after losing 3-1 to borussia dortmund last weekend bremen were keen to bounce back but had to settle for a point against aachen with miroslav klose salvaging a 2-2 tie with a 79th minute equalizer . it was hardly a confidence booster ahead of wednesday 's crucial champions league match with chelsea and they slip to third , two points behind schalke . " we wanted the three points but aachen were too strong for that , " said bremen coach thomas schaaf .
" it was a great game that had everything for the neutral . " goals from hamit altintop and former german international kevin kuranyi put schalke two goals up after 15 minutes against cottbus but sergiu radu scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 28 , 31 -rrb- to peg them back . christian pander put schalke back in front and levan kobiaschvili scored another as they moved to the summit . pointless hamburg playing for pride bildunterschrift : neither hamburg nor mainz managed to score in saturday 's game elsewhere , hamburg boss thomas doll is still searching for some relief after a 0-0 draw with bottom side mainz .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

museums hope to play a more active role in the restitution process . germany 's culture minister bernd neumann has invited leading museum representatives and legal experts to the berlin chancellery on monday .
a government spokesman said neumann wanted to get an idea of the situation facing german museums for artwork unfairly bought or confiscated by the nazis before and during world war two . museum directors have said they are going into the meeting with no demands , but rather suggestions on the major problems at hand concerning restitution .
a top item on their list is so-called " provenance " research , which traces the origins of a piece of art . " we believe more funds need to be invested into this kind of research , " said mechtild kronenberg , director of the german museum association - a sentiment shared by the jewish claims conference .
it said that provenance research was a key factor to help come to terms with the consequences of the nazi 's art theft . " but german institutions in particular should not lag behind internationally established standards , " the conference said in a position paper , such as those of us and british museums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst kirchner 's " berlin street scene " from 1913 however , there is only one researcher working full-time on provenance , ute haug at the hamburg kunsthalle .
two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

two other museums , the dresden state art collections and the städel museum in frankfurt , have art historians investigating their collections , but in part-time or temporary positions .
it is a small contribution to this kind of research considering germany is home to several thousand museums . promises are n't footing the bill haug said she hoped the berlin meeting would make the situation more transparent for neumann , as the problem itself is nothing new .
already in 1998 , the " washington conference on holocaust-era assets " took place , which addressed issues surrounding the restitution of assets confiscated between 1933 and 1945 . " for eight years , these difficulties have been known , for eight years there has been no money for provenance research , and for eight years there have been restitutions which could have gone better , " haug said . for decades , german museums kept the history of their holdings under lock and key - or simply ignored any irregularities .
statutes introduced after world war two stipulated that restitution claims had to be made by december 31 , 1948 .
art collectors or their heirs could make no legal claims thereafter - and that was the end of the discussion for german museums .
the washington conference changed this . one of the 11 principles in the conference declaration , which germany also signed , was : " resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the nazis and not subsequently restituted . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburger kunsthalle is returning a work owned by a nazi in 1999 , the german government , states and municipal organizations issued a joint statement promising to help people find looted artwork despite a legal deadline that had expired more than half a century ago . but promises do n't foot the bill .
in germany , there has been practically no public money for provenance research . disputed restitution case reignites debate culture minister neumann issued his invitation for monday following strong criticism of a recent restitution case in berlin .
the berlin senate returned the expressionist painting " berlin street scene " by ernst ludwig kirchner from 1913 to the granddaughter of jewish art collector alfred hess .
the work , in turn , was sold to cosmetics heir ronald lauder at an auction in new york last week for $ 38 million . " cases such as this are problematic , because the burden of proof lies with the owner , in this case the museum , " kronenberg said .
" but many documents do n't exist anymore . " although there was evidence that the painting was not a case of looted art , including written correspondence indicating it had been sold willingly , berlin 's brücke museum had no official receipt for the work . critics said germany 's restitution law needed an overhaul , as the country 's museums were losing significant works as a result .
hans-joachim otto from the opposition free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said the concept of restitution should not be discredited by the art market . however , restitution rules for artwork in public collections were " in some details " too rigid and needed adjustment , said otto , a member of the fdp and head of the parliamentary committee for culture .
he also expressed support for more research funding . " in the same way restitution practices should be put to the test , efforts for provenance research should be significantly intensified and supported by the federal and state governments , " otto said . many experts have observed that art historians specializing in provenance research are not being hired by museums , but rather by law firms specializing in restitution claims .
this led to what the museums association president michael eissenhauer called " big business " with restitution pieces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauder bought gustav klimt 's " adele bloch-bauer i " for $ 135 million in june 2006 " it 's worth it to go out and look for prey , to see which works can bring new blood to the art market , " eissenhauer told news agency ddp . but german museums are by no means backing down from their responsibilities , its association said . " if there is a justified restitution claim , there is no question whatsoever that a work will be returned , " kronenberg said . the hamburg kunsthalle , for example , is returning a 17th-century piece , which haug traced back to the private collection of the jewish art dealer jacques goudstikker .
it had been acquired by nazi leader hermann göring . germany should rethink its cultural priorities in the 1930s , the nazi regime began confiscating the property of jewish art dealers .
it forced many private collectors to simply hand over their artworks .
german museums were ordered to turn over cultural objects on loan from private jewish collections . the nazis looted this art partly for adolf hitler 's planned " führermuseum " in linz , a body intended to achieve world-class recognition .
hundreds of works also flowed into göring 's private collection . during the second world war , many german and dutch art dealers made a fortune off buying art below value from distraught jewish families trying to get money to leave the country .
these paintings were then sold or given back to german museums , where they may even have hung just years before . experts estimate there are between 100 and 150 pieces of art in question for restitution .
but without more research , germany 's public collections can not be thoroughly analyzed .
there have been suggestions that a central office for provenance research be established .
haug said this would be a good option . " it would have synergy effects , and help develop a network among art historians working in this area , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de artworks looted by nazis contribute to record-breaking auction it was a night of record-breaking prices , restituted nazi-looted artworks and controversial removals at auction house christie 's fall sale of impressionist and modern art in new york on wednesday night .

" her style is totally different from gerhard schröder and that is something she has kept .
where he made a big show of things , her style is to do the opposite , " her biographer gerd langguth told news agency afp . " she just comes into the room and speaks .
with schröder everything was much more pompous .
i think germans like this sort of modesty , " he said . economic upswing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first woman chancellor was sworn into office on nov .
22 , 2005 as germany 's first woman leader , merkel has led the so-called " grand coalition " to major policy decisions , reforming the funding of the healthcare system and raising the retirement age while tinkering with the tax system . unemployment , which bubbled ominously around the five-million mark before the election , fell in october to its lowest level in four years at around four million - and debt is down too . but a panel of company bosses polled by the allensbach research institute found that 55 percent of them believed the economic recovery had nothing to do with the work of the government . " after five lean years , germany is for once enjoying the sweet side of the business cycle .
it wo n't last forever , " said bank of america analyst holger schmieding . worse , he suggested , is that " the cyclical upswing has sapped the appetite in berlin for tackling the really unpopular issues . " foreign policy forte bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's pm presented merkel with the " vision for europe " prize last week while the infighting between right and left within her government has restricted her room to manoeuvre at home , merkel has been able to express herself in the field of foreign policy . " on the domestic scene , she is a bit confined by her role as a mediator , which makes international politics more attractive for her , " said josef janning of the bertelsmann foundation . the us-german relationship was severely strained by schröder 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war , but merkel has made it work again and she was instrumental in ensuring germany leads the naval component of the peacekeeping force after the lebanon-israel war . her surprisingly high profile abroad saw the chancellor - a pastor 's daughter from former east germany - voted the world 's most powerful woman by forbes magazine . yet merkel has enjoyed a year of two halves - riding a wave of popularity in the first six months , almost drowning in the cross-party bickering over the healthcare reforms in the second . surveys now show only a third of the country supports her conservatives , their lowest score since 2000 . and with germany set to take over the presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations and the european union in january , merkel will find dangers lurking around every corner . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .

it sounds romantic , but actually it stinks !
a german scientist can tell us why iron - which is also found in blood - smells when touched . an expert in germany believes he has discovered why iron smells when it comes in contact with skin .
he says the odor we can smell is not from the iron itself , but from a chemical reaction with our own skin oils . this is the same reaction that occurs when blood touches our skin , as blood contains iron . " the smell of iron upon contact with skin is , ironically , a type of human body odor , " dietmar glindemann said .
" it is an illusion that we are smelling the metal itself is . " scent for survival he believes this " blood scent " was useful to early humans in tracking down prey or other humans . glindemann has done some hunting himself , tracking down the responsible scent molecules , working in conjunction with a team of researchers from the virginia polytechnic institute and state university in the united states , the university of leipzig and the leipzig environmental research center in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early humans relied on their sense of smell to track prey or relatives , said glindemann in the scientific study , seven test subjects immediately recognized the musty , metallic odor when their hands came into contact with metallic iron or a solution containing iron ions with a two-fold positive charge . analysis of gas samples from the skin of the people involved in the test showed that a range of different organic compounds seemed to be characteristic of the metallic smell .
the key component is called 1-octen-2-one , which smells fungal-metallic even when highly diluted . blood has same effect and more intriguing is why iron apparently smells like blood .

the treasury select committee estimates that eight million people are excluded from financial services .
labour mp john mcfall criticised banks for giving basic account applicants " short shrift " and urged them to do more to include low-income customers .
the banks say they have created millions more basic accounts and made it easier for people to use services .
in its report - banking the unbanked - the committee urged banks to get rid of " unreasonable " penalty charges and introduce a £ 10 penalty-free buffer zone to help those on low incomes to manage their finances . "
a basic bank account is often an essential stepping stone to full financial inclusion for many people in society " labour mp john mcfall but it did not go so far as to call for new legislation to force all banks to open their doors to basic bank account holders .
during the last three years , around 1.97 million basic bank accounts have been opened in the uk .
the accounts are designed to encourage people who would not qualify for a standard bank account to enter the banking system .
basic account holders can use direct debit services as well as access atms .
however , there are systems in place to prevent them getting overdrawn .
' progress made ' but a recent investigation found that some banks did not provide prospective customers with sufficient literature or advice , or made it difficult for them to open basic accounts at high street branches .
the treasury committee said progress had been made towards a target of halving the number of people who do not have access to a bank account .
but it urged banks to " redouble their efforts " to encourage more people to open accounts .
' short shrift ' mr mcfall , committee chairman , said it was important to give low-income households access to financial services so they do not fall into a situation where they are at the mercy of loan sharks .
he said : " a basic bank account is often an essential stepping stone to full financial inclusion for many people in society .
" it helps them to gain legitimate employment , manage any debt they have and become accustomed to financial products . "
but he added : " some basic bank account applicants receive short shrift at bank branch counters .
" treating basic bank account holders like second class citizens by denying access to branch counters causes exclusion and reduces the opportunities for holders to become further integrated with the financial services sector . "
action urged he called on the banking code standards board to take action against any financial institution which was discovered to be dissuading people from opening bank accounts .
a spokesman for the british bankers ' association said bank customers were not regarded as second class citizens and its members were committed to doing more to encourage people to open accounts .
" there has been recognition that banks have done a great deal to get people into banking services , " he said .
the report also found that the post office had " enormous potential " as a gateway to banking and financial services .
a government spokesman said it would be studying the findings , but added that " steady progress " had already been made to halve the number of people without access to a bank account .

the treasury select committee estimates that eight million people are excluded from financial services .
labour mp john mcfall criticised banks for giving basic account applicants " short shrift " and urged them to do more to include low-income customers .
the banks say they have created millions more basic accounts and made it easier for people to use services .
in its report - banking the unbanked - the committee urged banks to get rid of " unreasonable " penalty charges and introduce a £ 10 penalty-free buffer zone to help those on low incomes to manage their finances .
a basic bank account is often an essential stepping stone to full financial inclusion for many people in society labour mp john mcfall but it did not go so far as to call for new legislation to force all banks to open their doors to basic bank account holders .
during the last three years , around 1.97 million basic bank accounts have been opened in the uk .
the accounts are designed to encourage people who would not qualify for a standard bank account to enter the banking system .
basic account holders can use direct debit services as well as access atms .
however , there are systems in place to prevent them getting overdrawn .
' progress made ' but a recent investigation found that some banks did not provide prospective customers with sufficient literature or advice , or made it difficult for them to open basic accounts at high street branches .
the treasury committee said progress had been made towards a target of halving the number of people who do not have access to a bank account .
but it urged banks to " redouble their efforts " to encourage more people to open accounts .
' short shrift ' mr mcfall , committee chairman , said it was important to give low-income households access to financial services so they do not fall into a situation where they are at the mercy of loan sharks .
he said : " a basic bank account is often an essential stepping stone to full financial inclusion for many people in society .
" it helps them to gain legitimate employment , manage any debt they have and become accustomed to financial products . "
but he added : " some basic bank account applicants receive short shrift at bank branch counters .
" treating basic bank account holders like second class citizens by denying access to branch counters causes exclusion and reduces the opportunities for holders to become further integrated with the financial services sector . "
action urged he called on the banking code standards board to take action against any financial institution which was discovered to be dissuading people from opening bank accounts .
a spokesman for the british bankers ' association said bank customers were not regarded as second class citizens and its members were committed to doing more to encourage people to open accounts .
" there has been recognition that banks have done a great deal to get people into banking services , " he said .
the report also found that the post office had " enormous potential " as a gateway to banking and financial services .

thousands of fans , some of whom had camped for several days , queued outside shops in new york and hollywood .
the japanese firm dominates the handheld gaming space , selling more than 200m ds and gameboys globally .
but its last home console , the gamecube , faltered as titles for the machine from third-party developers dried up .
the first buyer , isaiah " triforce " johnson , had been queuing outside the new york shop for more than a week .
" i had to get it first , " said the 29-year-old , who shook hands with nintendo of america president reggie fils-aime after buying the console .
' brave ' design nintendo hopes the wii , designed to be more accessible than rival machines , will boost its fortunes .
nintendo has decided to opt-out of the " arms race " of the current round of consoles , that has seen microsoft and sony play a game of brinkmanship with their xbox 360 and playstation 3 machines .
both firms have positioned their consoles as home entertainment hubs , offering high definition gaming and film playback , along with digital downloads and high-specification graphics and central processor chips .
instead , nintendo has attempted to re-design the gaming experience , opting for a controller which looks like a remote control but is motion sensitive , offering gamers a potentially simpler but at the same time more immersive experience .
wii explored gamers ' excitement factfile : nintendo wii the games for the machine have also been designed to be more accessible , with a focus on casual and family gaming .
analysts and experts are divided over whether nintendo will be able to break down the barriers between gamers and non-gamers but the firm has a track record of innovation .
third-party developers are embracing nintendo machines , with ubisoft , for example , offering seven titles at launch including red steel , far cry vengence and splinter cell : double agent .
electronic arts , the world 's biggest games publisher , has also backed the wii , admitting that the success nintendo had made of its ds handheld console had forced them to re-think their plans .
hiroshi kamide , director of research at kbc securities japan , believes wii will not only convert new gamers but also win over playstation and microsoft xbox fans , who may buy wii in addition to playstation 3 .
" the wii will expand the market pie and grow in that sense , but also actually be the second console of choice for all the core gamers , " he said , adding that wii 's success will depend on how well it does on both counts .
" it will be very interesting to see how much the market pie grows because of the wii .
but it is still a game console at the end of the day . "
wii has a pricing advantage at $ 250 -lrb- £ 132 -rrb- , half the price of the playstation 3 cheapest model .
the xbox 360 , which launched last year , sells for $ 300 -lrb- £ 158 -rrb- to $ 400 -lrb- £ 212 -rrb- .
nintendo spokesman yasuhiro minagawa has said nearly 400,000 wiis will be available for the japan launch date on 2 december , and likely more for the us launch on sunday .
the uk gets hold of the wii console on 8 december for £ 179 .

the committee concluded some people on low incomes had problems opening and operating basic bank accounts .
in particular , bank staff asking for excessive amounts of identification from applicants was seen as a problem .
but the committee ruled out laws to force banks to allow poorer consumers to open basic bank accounts as a right .
banking problems some basic bank account applicants receive short shrift at bank branch counters john mcfall , treasury select committee chairman basic bank accounts - which allow direct debits and cheque clearance but do not come with overdraft facilities - are designed to offer current account services to people on low incomes .
some low earners have traditionally either shunned banks or been turned down for banking services because they have a poor credit history .
since the creation of basic bank accounts , there had been " steady progress " in the target of halving the number of people without banking services , the committee noted .
however , bank staff still needed to raise their game , said committee chairman john mcfall mp .
" some basic bank account applicants receive short shrift at bank branch counters , " he said .
" treating basic bank account holders like second-class citizens , by denying access to branch counters , causes exclusion and reduces the opportunities for holders to become further integrated with the financial services sector . "
the committee also called on banks to introduce a £ 10 " buffer zone " , so that basic bank account customers who went a little into the red would not be hit with high penalty charges .
on thursday , the committee released a report which said poor consumers paid the most for credit and faced financial exclusion .

fireworks lit up the 15th century odescalchi castle following the evening ceremony .
katie holmes arrived in the rain , carrying her daughter and with her mother in tow .
photographers lined up outside the castle , hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple and guests .
about 150 relatives and friends gathered for the vows , cruise 's publicist said .
roberta armani , whose uncle giorgio designed the gown worn by holmes and cruise 's tuxedo , was the first to arrive .
holmes was spotted looking out from a window before the ceremony , which was celebrated by a scientology minister .
cruise waved to onlookers as he was driven through the town of bracciano to join his 27-year-old bride .
will smith and his wife jada pinkett smith were among the many stars invited to italy for the event .
