but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in kinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2006 eu leaders meet with protectionism row rumbling on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the power is not just in his hands as manuel barroso will find out this week eu leaders will meet thursday to create a common energy policy and agree on economic reforms to boost growth and jobs .
but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2006 tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees now seek out spain 's canary islands with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .
help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .

" while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .

right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .

" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2006 eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was asked by the un to provide peacekeeping support the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in kinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in kinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .

" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .
moving again the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .

eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said .

he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections . " we are taking a medium to longer term view rather than pulling out immediately after the elections , " annan said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- germany expects to lead eu peacekeeping force in congo talks between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and president joseph kabila in kinshasa this weekend resulted in a spoken agreement over a peacekeeping force that will be led by germany if the bundestag agrees .
-lrb- march 20 , 2006 -rrb- merkel prepared to send troops to congo , reports say according to german newspaper reports , chancellor angela merkel is willing to send troops to the democratic republic of congo to help with planned elections in the war-ravaged country .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .

the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .

" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin .

" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .

" as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2006 eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu was asked by the un to provide peacekeeping support the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .

but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2006 tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african refugees now seek out spain 's canary islands with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .
help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections .

" we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

but the present undercurrent of animosity and self-interest may prove to be a stumbling block . a brewing row over resurgent protectionism is threatening to cloud the summit in brussels that is - in theory - aimed at accelerating free-market reform in europe 's long-flagging economy . eu leaders will gather for their traditional two-day spring economic summit focused on promoting growth and jobs in the 25-nation bloc , which fears being overtaken by growing giants such as china and india . but on the eve of the gathering , plans emerged for a joint letter , initiated by italy but which may be co-signed by other more pro-reform states , denouncing a new protectionist trend in some states .
eu leaders and some member countries have been dismayed at recent attempts by france and spain to stave off takeovers by foreign companies . france , long criticized for protecting state-run enterprises , voiced diplomatic displeasure at the plans .
" it 's not the best way to help calm preparations for the summit , " said a french source , while another diplomat added : " rumors seem to be flying across brussels about who is and who is n't signing . " while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with figures for last year putting economic expansion in the euro zone at a mere 1.3 percent . the eu , still reeling from a debilitating political crisis last year , has hoped to use the brussels summit to energize reforms efforts aimed at making jobs regulations more flexible and increasing cross-border competition . fear of greater protectionism but europhiles , already depressed by last year 's french and dutch rejections of the eu 's first-ever constitution , now lament that the bloc is drifting towards greater protectionism in national economic policymaking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french are fighting off the italians over suez a string of cases has underlined this in recent weeks , including spanish efforts to block a german energy giant 's hostile takeover bid and french machinations to protect suez from italian group enel .
france is also a key opponent of plans to shake-up europe 's vast services sector , amid fears that workers from the eu 's poorer ex-communist newcomer states will undercut their western european rivals . italy abandoned on wednesday an attempt to rally free-marketeers in the eu to sign a letter denouncing protectionism in cross-border mergers after failing to garner any support , diplomats said . an italian diplomatic source told reuters that rome would not present the open letter at the summit because many governments did not think the initiative was appropriate . even governments that sympathize with its open market principles were reluctant to back a move seen as largely driven by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's beleaguered campaign for re-election . sweden , finland , ireland and the netherlands had politely declined to sign a draft circulated by italian finance minister giulio tremonti and even britain , berlusconi 's closest political ally , held back while voicing sympathy . economic nationalism not welcome european commission chief jose manuel barroso echoed the protectionist warning ahead of the brussels summit .
" economic nationalism was never a solution , and it is even less a solution today , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he 's not talking ; he 's not listening several sources said the letter may be at least in part politically motivated , with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi facing elections next month , in which is his main rival is former eu commission chief romano prodi . there was no immediate word from rome about the letter - although berlusconi 's critics warned the gaffe-prone leader to avoid creating a new spectacle in brussels .
" i invite him to keep control of himself and to represent italy in a dignified way , " said emma bonino of italy 's radical party and also a former eu commissioner . common energy policy on the agenda if and when the back-biting and grandstanding ends , the eu leaders will be faced with endorsing a european commission discussion paper proposing a common energy policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping the pipes open from russia will be a main objective it is hoped that there will an agreement on the proposed policy , which includes developing a strategic energy partnership with russia , the creation of greater alignment of national energy regulators and the encouragement of investment in diversification of energy sources . by the time the summit ends on friday , the officials will also have debated a number of issues regarding jobs and growth in the bloc . job and growth issues among the topics to be debated are the creation of a european institute of technology modelled on the massachusetts institute of technology in the united states , channelling investment and connecting businesses with research and innovation centers , simplifying administrative procedures for starting up a company and resolving disagreements over legislation designed to open up services to cross-border competition . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

the proposal which is now to be scrutinized by national governments is intended to complement citizenship tests already existing in a number of eu countries . " we agree that experts from our countries must examine the option of presenting an integration contract to new immigrants , " the interior minister of host country germany , wolfgang schäuble , told a news conference . schäuble said the contract would inform new arrivals " of the rights and obligations relevant to the process of integration , " after the so-called g6 meeting with his counterparts from britain , france , italy , poland and spain . foreigner test should not be seen as a threat schaüble said that the widespread use of such a contract in europe should not be seen by foreigners as a " threat " but rather an attempt to show immigrants " that we are offering to integrate them " but that immigration must be a " reciprocal " process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the maligned test , currently a topic of debate in germany , may get a european roll-out the ministers also agreed to do more to improve relations with their countries ' muslim communities by comparing notes on " inter-cultural and inter-faith dialogue and cooperation with countries of origin " , they wrote in a communiqué at the end of the two-day meeting . the six countries also agreed to intensify cooperation to fight illegal immigration by stepping up coordination of security services .
" with the support of europol , joint investigative teams are to be deployed to combat smuggling and trafficking of human beings or related crimes , " the communiqué said . " at the core of the problem is the fact that organized crime is heavily involved in illegal human trafficking , " wolfgang schäuble told reporters .
" we agreed that illegal immigration must be fought like other criminal acts carried out by these groups . " spanish minister warns of growing illegal immigration the spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso suarez underlined that illegal immigration would eventually become a problem for the european union as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suarez , center , spoke of the tragedy of human trafficking although his country was one of those primarily affected by it , the effects of human trafficking would also have repercussions on other countries .
he said that there was a human tragedy going on in the mediterranean as thousands of africans were seeking illegal entry into the union which could result in scores of people dying along the way . on combating terrorism , they said they would share the task of analyzing internet use by extremist groups , build joint support teams to assist a country in case of attack and start information visits at national counter-terrorism centers . ministers pledge to set up anti-terror support teams the ministers added that they would systematically exchange information on suspects expelled from g6 countries for preaching racial or religious hatred . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble pledged coordination in the struggle against terrorism " on the proposal of our spanish colleague and against the background of the terrible attack his country had to endure , we decided to set up pan-european support teams that will be deployed in such events .
they will serve as liaison headquarters to coordinate relief efforts across the european union , " germany ’ s schäuble said . the six ministers also said their cooperation was intended to forge a common european interior and security policy .
this new level of collaboration would already become evident during this summer 's soccer world cup in germany . the interior ministers said they would make a joint effort to prevent any outburst of hooligan violence by sharing police data and information well in advance of the championships . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .
he also promised that un peacekeepers would not abandon congo following the elections .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security . following the recent flood of african refugees from mauritania trying to reach the canary islands , the issue of illegal immigration is once again at the top of the eu 's agenda .
eu interior ministers meeting at the german baltic sea resort of heiligendamm starting wednesday will be discussing it , and at the request of the spanish government , the topic has also been included in the upcoming spring summit of eu heads of state . a solution to the daily drama being played out at the gates to europe is unlikely to come from either meeting . " the eu does n't have an answer about how to stop the deaths occurring at its outermost borders , " said karl kopp of the human rights organization , proasyl .
" instead , the strict surveillance of the borders has meant that more people are choosing longer and more difficult routes , resulting in more deaths . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants at a holding facility in the spanish enclave of melilla for many years , illegal immigrants have tried to reach spain by crossing the straits of gibraltar in flimsy boats .
now , only few still attempt this route , as the spanish police have installed a high-tech surveillance system known as sive , funded with eu money .
night vision cameras and radar devices capable of detecting an object as small as a football floating up to 20 kilometers out at sea have been positioned at strategic spots along spain 's southern coast .
spain and the eu plan to invest a further 130 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- in the system over the next four years . rather than attempt a crossing at the straits , the majority of refugees are opting to try their luck via the spain 's north african enclaves , ceuta and melilla .
many africans have died attempting to get over the barbed wire fences there and pictures of failed attempts have gone around the world .
the border has since been reinforced .
the fence is now six meters high in places and a barrier is to be extended out into the sea . since the start of the year , the main route for refugees from mauritania has been over the open sea to the canary islands .
in total , 3,500 africans have already landed there in their boats .
but many did n't make it .
according to information from the spanish police , between 1,200 and 1,700 africans drowned off the spanish coast in november and december alone , though the number of undocumented deaths is likely much higher . less money for repressive measures the eu 's reaction to the refugee drama has now taken on aspects of a ritual , says proasyl 's kopp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers fix razor wire to a fence in melilla " everyone is always shocked about the corpses washing up on tourist beaches , " he said .
" delegations are then sent to mauritania , where they discuss upping border controls and creating more capacity to take on refugees . " the spanish government dispatched patrol boats and earmarked 7.5 million euros for emergency treatment .
spanish engineers are now also supposed to build a refugee center . eu parliamentarians such as social democrat wolfgang kreissl-dörfler criticize the eu for spending too much money on police and border security . " at the moment , everyone is far too fixated on repressive measures , " he said , adding that the eu should finally focus on passing a common policy on illegal immigration . " as long as conditions in the immigrants ' countries of origin do n't improve , the stream of refugees will not abate , " kreissl-dörfler said . ewa klamt of the european parliament 's conservative christian democrat faction agreed . " we are still investing too little in local aid , " she said .
" we should remember that every refugee that lands on our doorstep costs far more money than what we would invest in that person 's country of origin . " where 's the money going ? both parliamentarians agree however , on the need to continue providing financial support to transit countries such as morocco and libya .
but there needs to be some insurance that the money is put to good use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants outside a temporary immigration centre in melilla " immigration has become big business , and it 's an open secret that even high-level military personnel have gotten wrapped up in human trafficking , " said kreissl-dörfler , who like klamt , visited ceuta and melilla in december .
he had to concede however , that keeping track of how the money is used is difficult . " it 's the eu commission 's responsibility to look into this further , " he said . above all , the eu has to ensure that illegal immigrants are treated humanely , the mep said .
right now , that 's wishful thinking .
take morocco as an example : jose palazon from the spanish ngo prodein has been looking after illegal immigrants in melilla for years , and reports that moroccan security officials routinely use violence on the africans camping in the woods outside melilla . " they 've forbidden the local population from giving the migrants food and water , " palazon said .
" morocco 's not putting a single a cent towards the care of these migrants . " after the flood of migrants to the enclaves of ceuta and melilla , the eu promised morocco 40 million euros in aid , mostly for police and border security .
according to klamt , the money has not yet been transferred .
it seems the conditions for its use were not clear . " it 's important to be practical when dealing with morocco , " klamt said .
" if we can find a good way to provide help in morocco , then we have reason to hope that other countries such as algeria will follow this example .

now , anyone wanting to follow in their iconic footsteps can take a tour through three decades of rock history . with its aura of cold war angst and unique status as a divided city , berlin in the 1980s was an obvious hang-out for many a wild child of rock .
temporarily home to a host of musicians including the ramones , depeche mode and u2 , the city also inspired lou reed 's classic album " berlin , " which has been described as " one of the darkest albums ever made . " steeped in shabby glamour , berlin has played an influential role in rock mythology , spawning some of the greatest pop music of the 20th century .
thilo schmied decided to pay tribute by offering tours through three decades of berlin pop history for visitors who want to see the places where the bands lived , played and recorded . the baby blu n der the first stop is the luxury hotel adlon on the landmark unter den linden avenue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson 's notorious baby-dangling incident " the hotel is part of music history , " schmied said .
" it 's where michael jackson dangled his baby from the balcony and almost dropped it . " berlin 's association with michael jackson started out on a far more auspicious note .
originally from the former east berlin , schmied heard jackson play live in 1988 - albeit from the other side of the berlin wall . " there were 500 or 600 of us , " he said .
" i was 14 .
at first you could n't hear anything .
then at the end they turned the loudspeakers around .
' man in the mirror ' piped over , and people got restless .
they wanted to cross over and started chanting ' the wall must go . '
the border guards and the secret police who 'd showed up were n't happy about that at all .
then the situation exploded , there was fighting , and my buddy and i took off . " the pu n k prese n ce the next port of call is an unassuming apartment block in the former west berlin . " in the late 70s , david bowie lived there on the second floor , which is now a dentist 's office , " schmied said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david bowie led a reclusive life in berlin the schöneberg apartment was where bowie composed one of his best-known songs " heroes , " which featured on the album that formed the centerpiece of a berlin trilogy and became something of an anthem once the wall fell . " i think what was so enjoyable when i was living in berlin in the 1970s was the anonymity i was able to have , " bowie has said .
" people did n't bother me at all .
it was so easy to be a regular guy and move around the streets . " the ha n sa studios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u2 also recorded at the hansa studios the tour continues to the legendary hansa studios on potsdamer platz , where " heroes " was recorded .
other bands who 've worked here include iggy pop , depeche mode and u2 , whose 1990 album " achtung baby " was produced here by brian eno .
the studios are arguably germany 's version of abbey road . " depeche mode like to use field recording from berlin - the sounds in the subway , anything they could find , " schmied said .
" then they worked the sounds into the songs they recorded at hansa . " latter-day lege n ds the tour also takes in some institutions of berlin club culture , such as the long-standing punk hangout " so 36 " in the western berlin district of kreuzberg , and the former site of " tresor , " the fabled techno temple that headed the explosion of electronic dance music in the 1990s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local heroes seeed techno is still around , but today 's young people favor the reggae-style hip-hop of local heroes such as seeed , who tend to feature berlin heavily in their videos . " i 've been in the city for two months and knew most of the spots but this opened up a fully new perspective , " said one participant on schmied 's tour . he constantly revises the itinerary , and is currently developing special tours for specific genres .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain . provided no member states object to the mission , the eu 's austrian presidency will inform the united nations on thursday that an eu deployment of up to 1,450 troops will provide support to the un 's 17,000-strong force in the drc during elections in june . germany has been slated to lead the mission , though this remains subject to approval by the german parliament , the bundestag .
the vote is scheduled for early may .
despite opposition from a cross-section of german mps , the ministry of defense in berlin appears confident the mission will go ahead as planned . " the headquarters will be in potsdam but they are staffed multi-nationally , " a spokesman from the ministry told reuters . german doubts german chancellor angela merkel will meet with party leaders on monday to inform them about the controversial mission .
several german mps have expressed doubts about the efficacy of such a small deployment in a country the size of the drc , and are concerned about the possibility of european troops coming into conflict situations with child soldiers . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said she was in favor of the mission as long as an end date was clear from the outset and the deployment was limited to the capital , kinshasa , where child soldiers are generally not active . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung : four months is sufficient german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday that he considers a deployment of four months to be sufficient , and that the mission could also likely be completed in less than four months . a time limit of four months is one of the conditions being set by the opposition green party for its approval . un secretary general kofi annan welcomed the prospect of the eu military mission during a visit to kinshasa this week .

and more than 25,000 people in wales - almost 10,000 more than last year - took part in the annual survey .
but while numbers taking part were up , the results show a marked decline in some garden birds .
although the house sparrow retained top spot , its numbers were significantly down from the first birdwatch in 1979 .
birdwatchers across wales flocked to their gardens and local parks for the big garden birdwatch held on the last weekend of january and spent one hour counting the birdlife .
wendy johnson , rspb cymru 's big garden birdwatch co-ordinator , said they do not know why the numbers of the house sparrow are falling .
top species in wales average per garden sparrow : 5.2 blue tit : 3.8 chaffinch : 3.7 starling : 3.7 blackbird : 2.8 great tit : 1.9 greenfinch : 1.8 robin : 1.6 collared dove : 1.3 jackdaw : 1.3 " it has been declining ever since we started the survey in 1979 , " she said .
" numbers are almost 50 % down in wales although it is doing substantially better here than in the rest of the uk .
an average of just 5.2 sparrows were seen in each welsh garden this year , compared to an average of 10 in 1979 .
" it 's difficult to know why - it could be down to habitat .
" there are not always the roostings for the birds to nest .
that 's because modern houses do not have the nooks and crannies the older buildings used to .
" there has to be places for them -lsb- sparrows -rsb- to find comfort . "
colder winter she said climate change could also be a factor and part of the purpose of the rspb annual birdwatch was to monitor the decline .
numbers of starlings have also continued to drop during the period of the birdwatch - its numbers are down more than 70 % since 1979 .
it shares its place as the third most common visitor to welsh gardens with the chaffinch .
but many people who took part noted higher numbers of blackbirds and song thrushes in their gardens .
ms johnson said this was probably because of the colder winter this year .
the blackbird was also the most widespread species spotted in wales , recorded in 94 % of all gardens .

the audit commission probe has revealed serious errors in the way managers handled the doomed £ 1.2bn deal .

he says the future of the plan , which would have seen 3,000 council staff switch to a private company , will be reassessed once all other matters have been dealt with .

the study said the combination of still and video cameras on modern phones , and the advent of high speed data transfer , can inspire a generation of users .
bloggers , film-makers and clubbers all benefit from 3g phones , it said .
analysts future laboratory said the report was the first ethnographic survey of 3g use across the uk .
3g is the next generation of mobile phone technology , offering a wide range of high speed mobile services , including video calling and messaging , e-mail , games , photo messaging and information services .
free to use researchers studied the phone habits of 10 groups of friends between the ages of 16-35 over six weeks in a range of uk cities .
they identified a range of new behavioural patterns among those using 3g phones , which were free of charge for the duration of the study .
new technology on offer allowed a diverse range of personalities to express themselves creatively in different ways , the report said .
3g users social gatekeepers : fulcrum of a social network and use 3g mobiles to keep friends up to date piratopians : creative outsiders who use 3g phones to make short films and other broadcasts high street hedonists : use phones to show off new purchases , take pictures of items or asked for instant opinions from a dressing room alfred tong , one of the report 's authors , admitted that allowing free use of the phones encouraged heavy use , but said the study offered a glimpse into a 3g future .
" without the constraints of price , we hope these results illustrate how people will use 3g as the technology spreads , " he told the bbc news website .
the report 's authors dubbed the new generation of mobile phone users generation c , with c meaning content .
as well as offering bloggers the chance to post instantly to their own sites , researchers saw 3g phones used as a counterpoint to retailing , socialising , and as a tool for documenting their lives .
analyst ben wood said he welcomed the study , but said that most mobile phone users remain concerned about looks , cost and battery life above all else .
" it 's very hard to get people to discover these services and to use them , " he said .
3g operators were still seeking ways to maximise income from multimedia services without putting off customers , he added .
' andrew marr effect ' according to mobile network 3 which commissioned the study , almost two-thirds of current 3g users -lrb- 62 % -rrb- are men .
it set up the uk 's first 3g network and currently boasts 3.6 million customers . "
historically , if lots of people start to use mobile services they are very viral and will spread " ben wood research vice-president , gartner but the technology is most popular among the more affluent 25-34 age group , not the 18-24 age group often targeted by advertisers .
men used the technical capabilities of their phones more extensively than women , the report suggested , often adopting fictional personas to make amateur news reports , dubbed the " andrew marr effect " by researchers .
some women used their phones to take pictures of taxi drivers in an effort to guarantee personal safety .
the increasing use of camera and video capabilities has already opened up new opportunities for phone users to contribute to news coverage on tv and online .
and the time-honoured blind date could soon fall out of fashion , if the report 's conclusions are correct .
more and more people might use 3g phones to check out a potential date before meeting them , or use video calls as part of an interactive dating service .
some exceptionally tech-savvy young men , the report found , won the hearts of women simply by impressing them with the use of their hi-tech tool , labelled natching by the future laboratory .
that might appear one unlikely new development , but the pattern of mobile phone growth has always bucked the prevailing trends , analyst ben wood said .
" what we have seen happen historically is if people start to use new services , especially in some demographic groups , they are very viral and will spread .
" if you had sat in a focus group about text messaging 15 years ago and i told you that soon we would be sending billions of these each year you would have said i was mad . "

mr boni won almost 75 % of the vote in sunday 's run-off presidential election with adrien houngbedji , the country 's election commission said .
he will be sworn in on 6 april to replace long-time leader mathieu kerekou , whose age made him ineligible to stand again .
the election had some irregularities but international monitors pronounced them largely free and fair .
voters thanked mr boni said on wednesday he would build a government of " young , clean , just and new men " to tackle poverty and corruption , according to afp news agency .
the election commission said mr boni , a former development banker , won 1,969,308 votes on sunday compared to 673,763 for mr houngbedji , a former speaker of the national assembly .
turnout was 67 % , compared to 70 % for the first round on 5 march .
sylvain nouwatin , head of benin 's electoral commission , thanked voters for the ordered election process , saying : " democracy is the sole winner . "
sunday 's second round was a scramble for organisers because mr kerekou ignored a constitutional court ruling to postpone the run-off for three days .
mr boni is a newcomer to benin 's political scene and has spent a lot of time abroad .
he quit his job as president of the togo-based west african development bank -lrb- boad -rrb- , where he had worked since 1994 , to join the presidential race .
as an economist , his campaign focussed on the economy and in particular reform of the cotton sector , the country 's major export .
born in 1952 , into a northern muslim family , he later became an evangelical christian .
he is married with five children and comes from one of the country 's three influential ethnic groups , the nago .

sunday 's second round was a scramble for organisers because mr kerekou ignored a constitutional court ruling to postpone the run-off for three days .
mr boni is a newcomer to benin 's political scene and has spent a lot of time abroad .
he quit his job as president of the togo-based west african development bank -lrb- boad -rrb- , where he had worked since 1994 , to join the presidential race .

the 74-year-old joined the throngs to march against the war in london in the spring of 2003 .
but he decided that he would have to brave the well-reported dangers of iraq if he was to truly make a difference .
mr kember was on a christian peacemaker teams trip with american tom fox , 54 , and canadians james loney , 41 , and harmeet singh sooden , 32 , who were also captured .
before leaving on his two-week mission mr kember told premier christian radio that he felt he had only written and talked about peacemaking .
" i 've demonstrated , but i feel that 's what i 'd call cheap peacemaking . "
human rights asked in the interview if his expedition to iraq could prove more costly , he admitted : " it could be " .
the group met the iraqi authorities at electricity and oil plants to investigate the reasons for power shortages and held talks with local activists over human rights issues .
after margaret hassan , a dublin-born aid worker , was kidnapped and believed murdered , many agencies pulled out of iraq completely .
if a westerner who was an iraqi citizen , married to an iraqi and resident in the country for 30 years could fall victim to the kidnappers , then the risk to foreign workers with vastly inferior local knowledge was severe .
a total of 238 foreign nationals were kidnapped in iraq between may 2003 and 20 november 2005 , with about one in five killed , according to research by the brookings institution in washington .
thousands of iraqis have been kidnapped over the same period , with many held at any given time .
the cpt 's mission statement on its website is " committed to reducing violence by getting in the way " .
mr kember 's group is not thought to have had armed security with it , and the area they were kidnapped in is considered dangerous by the authorities in iraq .
terry waite , who was a hostage in beirut for four years , questioned the group 's approach , saying mr kember had endangered himself by travelling to such a polarised situation .
widespread appeals the militant group that captured mr kember and his colleagues , the previously unknown swords of truth brigade , demanded the release of all prisoners in us and iraqi detention .
they claimed the captives were spies , only masquerading as christian peace activists .
but the white-haired medical physicist from pinner seemed a particularly unlikely candidate for such a far-fetched allegation .
appeals for his release came from all directions .
moazzam begg led britain 's former guantanamo bay detainees , in appealing the kidnappers to acknowledge that the men were opponents of the war .
abu qatada , described as once having been al-qaeda 's " ambassador to europe " , and currently held at full sutton prison pending his deportation , volunteered his services .
he said the militants should free the men " in line with the principle of mercy of our religion " .
muslim envoy the main sunni party in iraq , the iraqi islamic party , said there was a danger that islam could be tarnished by the crime , and the world 's oldest islamic movement , egypt 's muslim brotherhood , has also joined the fray .
iraqi-born muslim association of britain anas altikriti went to iraq and jordan in an attempt to mediate in the efforts to release mr kember and his colleagues .
in the last video released by the kidnappers , the hostages seemed to be being treated differently .
mr kember and mr fox , were shown blindfolded in orange jumpsuits in a chilling echo of the treatment of beheaded engineer ken bigley .
some have contrasted this with the canadian captives , whose country opposed the war .
perhaps the most plaintive appeal came from mr kember himself .
his voice cracked , and obviously speaking under duress , he uttered a plea which seemed to square with his own views .
" i ask mr blair to take british troops out of iraq and leave the iraqi people to come to their own decisions on their government . "

the 74-year-old joined the throngs to march against the war in london in the spring of 2003 .
but he decided that he would have to brave the well-reported dangers of iraq if he was to truly make a difference .
mr kember was on a christian peacemaker teams trip with american tom fox , 54 , and canadians james loney , 41 , and harmeet singh sooden , 32 , who were also captured .
before leaving on his two-week mission mr kember told premier christian radio that he felt he had only written and talked about peacemaking .
" i 've demonstrated , but i feel that 's what i 'd call cheap peacemaking . "
human rights asked in the interview if his expedition to iraq could prove more costly , he admitted : " it could be " .
the group met the iraqi authorities at electricity and oil plants to investigate the reasons for power shortages and held talks with local activists over human rights issues .
after margaret hassan , a dublin-born aid worker , was kidnapped and believed murdered , many agencies pulled out of iraq completely .
moazzam begg was among those joining the appeals if a westerner who was an iraqi citizen , married to an iraqi and resident in the country for 30 years could fall victim to the kidnappers , then the risk to foreign workers with vastly inferior local knowledge was severe .
a total of 238 foreign nationals were kidnapped in iraq between may 2003 and 20 november 2005 , with about one in five killed , according to research by the brookings institution in washington .
thousands of iraqis have been kidnapped over the same period , with many held at any given time .
the cpt 's mission statement on its website is " committed to reducing violence by getting in the way " .
mr kember 's group is not thought to have had armed security with it , and the area they were kidnapped in is considered dangerous by the authorities in iraq .
terry waite , who was a hostage in beirut for four years , questioned the group 's approach , saying mr kember had endangered himself by travelling to such a polarised situation .
widespread appeals the militant group that captured mr kember and his colleagues , the previously unknown swords of truth brigade , demanded the release of all prisoners in us and iraqi detention .
they claimed the captives were spies , only masquerading as christian peace activists .
but the white-haired medical physicist from pinner seemed a particularly unlikely candidate for such a far-fetched allegation .
appeals for his release came from all directions .
moazzam begg led britain 's former guantanamo bay detainees , in appealing the kidnappers to acknowledge that the men were opponents of the war .
abu qatada , described as once having been al-qaeda 's " ambassador to europe " , and currently held at full sutton prison pending his deportation , volunteered his services .
he said the militants should free the men " in line with the principle of mercy of our religion " .
muslim envoy the main sunni party in iraq , the iraqi islamic party , said there was a danger that islam could be tarnished by the crime , and the world 's oldest islamic movement , egypt 's muslim brotherhood , has also joined the fray .
