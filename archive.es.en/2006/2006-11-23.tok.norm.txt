the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

" we want to make the mission in afghanistan a success , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on the first anniversary of her swearing-in as chancellor . " the german military is doing an important and dangerous job , " she said .
" but i see no military commitment beyond this mandate . " the german force of about 2,750 soldiers is based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . they are primarily involved in reconstruction projects and supply logistical support in the fight against opium production . increased fighting putting pressure on troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has spent 70 million euros on training afghan police although the german government voted last month to extend the troop 's mission for another year , the mandate limits the forces to activities around the northern cities of kabul , kunduz , and faizabad , although they are permitted to be deployed to the south in the case of an emergency . germany has been under repeated pressure to allow its combat troops to be sent to the south of afghanistan , where isaf forces have had increasing casualties in recent months in the face of unexpectedly fierce resistance from taliban fighters . in the wake of increased fighting nato 's supreme allied commander europe james jones repeated a call for additional troops to be sent to the region .
he said afghanistan needed a total of about 2,500 more troops , an increase of about 15 percent . " if we 're properly organized and we bring all elements of our efforts together in cohesion , we will win , " he said .
" if we do n't , it will be longer and it will be more difficult and it will be more costly . " nato wants more troops in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said troops in afghanistan 's south are stretched thin in a recent speech in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer emphasized that nato needed to be involved in " the full spectrum of operations , from combat to peacekeeping . " germany is expected to face further pressure at next week 's two-day nato summit in riga , latvia . berlin has ruled out contributing additional forces and merkel said re-deploying the troops now could undo what they had achieved . " the german army is carrying out a difficult and important role in the north and we do not want to put the success of this mission in jeopardy , " she said .
" i do n't see anyone who seriously wants to endanger the relative security that we have achieved in the north . " in a similar vein , the social democrats parliamentary leader and former defense minister , peter struck , said discussions about changing the mandate were incomprehensible . summit should be more than north-south debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at the highest level since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 " our responsibility is in the north , and that 's how it will stay , " he said in parliament on wednesday . he added that german soldiers would remain helping reconstruct afghanistan , and added that sending combat troops into a region was " not a way to win the population 's trust . " merkel also said that nato needed to use the summit in riga to do more than discuss where troops need to be stationed . " we need a new approach that intelligently unifies security and reconstruction , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us calls on germany for riskier afghanistan missions the us administration is increasing pressure on germany to lift restrictions on its afghanistan directive and help reinforce combat troops in the south to stop taliban insurgents .

" we want to make the mission in afghanistan a success , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on the first anniversary of her swearing-in as chancellor . " the german military is doing an important and dangerous job , " she said .
" but i see no military commitment beyond this mandate . " the german force of about 2,750 soldiers is based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . they are primarily involved in reconstruction projects and supply logistical support in the fight against opium production . increased fighting putting pressure on troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has spent 70 million euros on training afghan police although the german government voted last month to extend the troop 's mission for another year , the mandate limits the forces to activities around the northern cities of kabul , kunduz , and faizabad , although they are permitted to be deployed to the south in the case of an emergency . germany has been under repeated pressure to allow its combat troops to be sent to the south of afghanistan , where isaf forces have had increasing casualties in recent months in the face of unexpectedly fierce resistance from taliban fighters . in the wake of increased fighting nato 's supreme allied commander europe james jones repeated a call for additional troops to be sent to the region .
he said afghanistan needed a total of about 2,500 more troops , an increase of about 15 percent . " if we 're properly organized and we bring all elements of our efforts together in cohesion , we will win , " he said .
" if we do n't , it will be longer and it will be more difficult and it will be more costly . " nato wants more troops in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said troops in afghanistan 's south are stretched thin in a recent speech in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer emphasized that nato needed to be involved in " the full spectrum of operations , from combat to peacekeeping . " germany is expected to face further pressure at next week 's two-day nato summit in riga , latvia . berlin has ruled out contributing additional forces and merkel said re-deploying the troops now could undo what they had achieved . " the german army is carrying out a difficult and important role in the north and we do not want to put the success of this mission in jeopardy , " she said .
" i do n't see anyone who seriously wants to endanger the relative security that we have achieved in the north . " in a similar vein , the social democrats parliamentary leader and former defense minister , peter struck , said discussions about changing the mandate were incomprehensible . summit should be more than north-south debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at the highest level since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 " our responsibility is in the north , and that 's how it will stay , " he said in parliament on wednesday . he added that german soldiers would remain helping reconstruct afghanistan , and added that sending combat troops into a region was " not a way to win the population 's trust . " merkel also said that nato needed to use the summit in riga to do more than discuss where troops need to be stationed .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 23.11.2006 germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 18-year-old stormed his old high school , apparently with a weapon he 'd bought online germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .
but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .
since then , he has operated with a provisional exemption , which was issued until the legal battle was decided . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the ramadan fast in germany ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .

" you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops .

he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 23.11.2006 germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 18-year-old stormed his old high school , apparently with a weapon he 'd bought online germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .
but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .
" it 's the way we are that is the trouble .

the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .

" we want to make the mission in afghanistan a success , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on the first anniversary of her swearing-in as chancellor . " the german military is doing an important and dangerous job , " she said .
" but i see no military commitment beyond this mandate . " the german force of about 2,750 soldiers is based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . they are primarily involved in reconstruction projects and supply logistical support in the fight against opium production . increased fighting putting pressure on troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has spent 70 million euros on training afghan police although the german government voted last month to extend the troop 's mission for another year , the mandate limits the forces to activities around the northern cities of kabul , kunduz , and faizabad , although they are permitted to be deployed to the south in the case of an emergency . germany has been under repeated pressure to allow its combat troops to be sent to the south of afghanistan , where isaf forces have had increasing casualties in recent months in the face of unexpectedly fierce resistance from taliban fighters . in the wake of increased fighting nato 's supreme allied commander europe james jones repeated a call for additional troops to be sent to the region .
he said afghanistan needed a total of about 2,500 more troops , an increase of about 15 percent . " if we 're properly organized and we bring all elements of our efforts together in cohesion , we will win , " he said .
" if we do n't , it will be longer and it will be more difficult and it will be more costly . " nato wants more troops in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said troops in afghanistan 's south are stretched thin in a recent speech in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer emphasized that nato needed to be involved in " the full spectrum of operations , from combat to peacekeeping . " germany is expected to face further pressure at next week 's two-day nato summit in riga , latvia . berlin has ruled out contributing additional forces and merkel said re-deploying the troops now could undo what they had achieved . " the german army is carrying out a difficult and important role in the north and we do not want to put the success of this mission in jeopardy , " she said .
" i do n't see anyone who seriously wants to endanger the relative security that we have achieved in the north . " in a similar vein , the social democrats parliamentary leader and former defense minister , peter struck , said discussions about changing the mandate were incomprehensible . summit should be more than north-south debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at the highest level since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 " our responsibility is in the north , and that 's how it will stay , " he said in parliament on wednesday . he added that german soldiers would remain helping reconstruct afghanistan , and added that sending combat troops into a region was " not a way to win the population 's trust . " merkel also said that nato needed to use the summit in riga to do more than discuss where troops need to be stationed . " we need a new approach that intelligently unifies security and reconstruction , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us calls on germany for riskier afghanistan missions the us administration is increasing pressure on germany to lift restrictions on its afghanistan directive and help reinforce combat troops in the south to stop taliban insurgents .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 23.11.2006 germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 18-year-old stormed his old high school , apparently with a weapon he 'd bought online germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .
but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen . " the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .
wolfgang dicke , a federal police union weapons expert , agreed . " you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .
since then , he has operated with a provisional exemption , which was issued until the legal battle was decided . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the ramadan fast in germany ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .
since then , he has operated with a provisional exemption , which was issued until the legal battle was decided . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the ramadan fast in germany ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .
since then , he has operated with a provisional exemption , which was issued until the legal battle was decided . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the ramadan fast in germany ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops .

" the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .

" you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .
but the education system put teachers under too much pressure to react . for streitberger from forum waffenrecht , the laws are not the answer to keep teenagers like sebastian from acquiring weapons . " the weapons are not the problem , " streitberger said .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops .

" the instruments of the law are of little use when someone does not adhere to the law , " streitberger said .
he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .
buying and selling weapons in germany involves detailed documentation and proof of authorization . " but it 's easier to buy a weapon behind the train station than it is to legally do so , " streitberger said . in germany , the number of illegal weapons is at least double that of legal guns , he added .
legal weapons owners only account for 0.004 percent of all crimes committed with firearms in germany .
according to streitberger , stricter laws would not reduce crimes with guns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police found explosives on the teenager 's body and in his backpack " we 've always said to the government , ' do n't make the barriers too high or they will be disregarded , " ' streitberger said .

" you have to be careful that you do n't overshoot the mark with bans , " dicke told the daily süddeutsche zeitung . streitberger said germany was stuck between a rock and a hard place . " it is always a tightrope walk between protecting society and ensuring individual freedom , " streitberger said . perpetrator had a history of illegal weapons use the münster police said they had found three seemingly historical firearms with the teenager 's body .
two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem . " these weapons can be technically reversed , " he said . germany 's strict conditions for weapons sales did n't apply when an antique weapon was reconstructed and armed , hermani from the interior ministry said . is society to blame ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the gunman 's three firearms was this small caliber vintage weapon the shooting in emsdetten has brought back memories of germany 's worst high school massacre in 2002 in the eastern german city of erfurt .
an expelled former pupil , robert steinhäuser , went on a shooting spree , leaving 17 dead including himself .
the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .
he was supposed to appear before the youth court in nearby rheine on tuesday on charges of violating the weapons law . adolf gallwitz , a professor for psychology and sociology at the polytechnic university for police in villingen-schwenningen , said sebastian had probably behaved conspicuously in the past . " in the run-up to this , there were probably a multitude of distress signals , " gallwitz told the broadcaster ard 's web site tagesschau.de .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .
since then , he has operated with a provisional exemption , which was issued until the legal battle was decided . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the ramadan fast in germany ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .

he said the current discussion was " a pseudo-debate , " as germany had among the strictest weapons laws in the world .

two of the guns were so-called " percussion weapons . "
these are built according to antique constructions designed before 1870 and can be purchased without a permit .
the third , a small-bore rifle , required a gun license . sebastian b. had also affixed three homemade pipe bombs onto his body , the police said .
five further such devices were found in his backpack . brockert from the bka said cases involving replicas of guns or weapons made inoperative for decorative purposes were a problem .

the incident led german authorities to tighten weapons laws . but at the time there was also a lot of public debate as to whether parents , teachers and steinhäuser 's surroundings carried responsibility for his crime . in the current case , sebastian b. had previously had a run-in with the police for his use of firearms .

but a school shooting this week raises the question of whether the internet presents a loophole for illegally acquiring weapons . initial investigations of a school shooting in germany earlier this week indicated that the perpetrator purchased his weapons arsenal on the internet . sebastian b. was a former student of the geschwister scholl school in the north-western town of emsdetten .
the 18-year old ran amok there on monday , injuring 37 people before killing himself .
the police in münster investigating the shooting said the teenager had three guns and explosives on him . investigators looking into exactly how he acquired the weapons have been focusing their research on the internet portal egun , based in darmstadt , where sebastian b. is believed to have bought at least one gun .
the site declined to comment on the allegations . " there are very clear regulations regarding weapons purchases , " said christian brockert , spokesman for the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , in wiesbaden .
" of course if you have a license , it 's very simple to buy certain weapons , such as in hunting shops . " although the laws also apply to internet sales , gabriele hermani , a spokeswoman for the federal interior ministry , said authorities were still reviewing whether internet sales of weapons posed a legal loophole . weapons lobby says laws are adequate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shocked students at the high school met with psychologists after the incident more gun control was nonetheless not the right solution , said joachim streitberger , spokesman for the weapons lobby group forum waffenrecht , based in emmendingen .

the federal tribunal in the eastern city of leipzig disagreed thursday . exceptions made for religious slaughter the judges directed the local authority to issue a permit to altinkupe for his shop in the town of asslar , but said strict conditions should be attached .
butchers in other german places already have permits . according to germany 's law covering animal cruelty , warm-blooded animals must be anaesthetized , usually with an electric shock , before slaughter , but allows exemptions under religious rules such as halal killing or judaism 's kosher dietary rules . halal rules require an islamic prayer to be recited as the animal 's blood is let . altinkupe , 39 , who has been a butcher for the past 18 years , possessed an exemption until 1995 when the authority blocked it .

" we want to make the mission in afghanistan a success , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on the first anniversary of her swearing-in as chancellor . " the german military is doing an important and dangerous job , " she said .
" but i see no military commitment beyond this mandate . " the german force of about 2,750 soldiers is based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . they are primarily involved in reconstruction projects and supply logistical support in the fight against opium production . increased fighting putting pressure on troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has spent 70 million euros on training afghan police although the german government voted last month to extend the troop 's mission for another year , the mandate limits the forces to activities around the northern cities of kabul , kunduz , and faizabad , although they are permitted to be deployed to the south in the case of an emergency . germany has been under repeated pressure to allow its combat troops to be sent to the south of afghanistan , where isaf forces have had increasing casualties in recent months in the face of unexpectedly fierce resistance from taliban fighters . in the wake of increased fighting nato 's supreme allied commander europe james jones repeated a call for additional troops to be sent to the region .
he said afghanistan needed a total of about 2,500 more troops , an increase of about 15 percent . " if we 're properly organized and we bring all elements of our efforts together in cohesion , we will win , " he said .
" if we do n't , it will be longer and it will be more difficult and it will be more costly . " nato wants more troops in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said troops in afghanistan 's south are stretched thin in a recent speech in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer emphasized that nato needed to be involved in " the full spectrum of operations , from combat to peacekeeping . " germany is expected to face further pressure at next week 's two-day nato summit in riga , latvia . berlin has ruled out contributing additional forces and merkel said re-deploying the troops now could undo what they had achieved . " the german army is carrying out a difficult and important role in the north and we do not want to put the success of this mission in jeopardy , " she said .
" i do n't see anyone who seriously wants to endanger the relative security that we have achieved in the north . " in a similar vein , the social democrats parliamentary leader and former defense minister , peter struck , said discussions about changing the mandate were incomprehensible . summit should be more than north-south debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at the highest level since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 " our responsibility is in the north , and that 's how it will stay , " he said in parliament on wednesday . he added that german soldiers would remain helping reconstruct afghanistan , and added that sending combat troops into a region was " not a way to win the population 's trust . " merkel also said that nato needed to use the summit in riga to do more than discuss where troops need to be stationed . " we need a new approach that intelligently unifies security and reconstruction , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us calls on germany for riskier afghanistan missions the us administration is increasing pressure on germany to lift restrictions on its afghanistan directive and help reinforce combat troops in the south to stop taliban insurgents .

" we want to make the mission in afghanistan a success , " merkel said in a speech to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on the first anniversary of her swearing-in as chancellor . " the german military is doing an important and dangerous job , " she said .
" but i see no military commitment beyond this mandate . " the german force of about 2,750 soldiers is based in the relatively peaceful north of afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . they are primarily involved in reconstruction projects and supply logistical support in the fight against opium production . increased fighting putting pressure on troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has spent 70 million euros on training afghan police although the german government voted last month to extend the troop 's mission for another year , the mandate limits the forces to activities around the northern cities of kabul , kunduz , and faizabad , although they are permitted to be deployed to the south in the case of an emergency . germany has been under repeated pressure to allow its combat troops to be sent to the south of afghanistan , where isaf forces have had increasing casualties in recent months in the face of unexpectedly fierce resistance from taliban fighters . in the wake of increased fighting nato 's supreme allied commander europe james jones repeated a call for additional troops to be sent to the region .
he said afghanistan needed a total of about 2,500 more troops , an increase of about 15 percent . " if we 're properly organized and we bring all elements of our efforts together in cohesion , we will win , " he said .
" if we do n't , it will be longer and it will be more difficult and it will be more costly . " nato wants more troops in the south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said troops in afghanistan 's south are stretched thin in a recent speech in brussels , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer emphasized that nato needed to be involved in " the full spectrum of operations , from combat to peacekeeping . " germany is expected to face further pressure at next week 's two-day nato summit in riga , latvia . berlin has ruled out contributing additional forces and merkel said re-deploying the troops now could undo what they had achieved . " the german army is carrying out a difficult and important role in the north and we do not want to put the success of this mission in jeopardy , " she said .
" i do n't see anyone who seriously wants to endanger the relative security that we have achieved in the north . " in a similar vein , the social democrats parliamentary leader and former defense minister , peter struck , said discussions about changing the mandate were incomprehensible . summit should be more than north-south debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in afghanistan is at the highest level since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 " our responsibility is in the north , and that 's how it will stay , " he said in parliament on wednesday . he added that german soldiers would remain helping reconstruct afghanistan , and added that sending combat troops into a region was " not a way to win the population 's trust . " merkel also said that nato needed to use the summit in riga to do more than discuss where troops need to be stationed . " we need a new approach that intelligently unifies security and reconstruction , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us calls on germany for riskier afghanistan missions the us administration is increasing pressure on germany to lift restrictions on its afghanistan directive and help reinforce combat troops in the south to stop taliban insurgents .

frings said the team had believed in their chances of winning . " we have been playing well in the champions league and even though the situation was similar to our match against barcelona where we conceded the equalizer in the last minute , we always believed that we would win , " frings said .

a uk-led team made a detailed analysis of the dna found in 270 people and identified vast regions to be duplicated or even missing .
a great many of these variations are in areas of the genome that would not damage our health , matthew hurles and colleagues told the journal nature .
but others are - and can be shown to play a role in a number of disorders .
" we were certainly surprised ; we expected to find that there would be some variation , but we were n't expecting to find quite this much , " dr hurles told bbc news .
to date , the investigation of the human genome has tended to focus on very small changes in dna that can have deleterious effects - at the scale of just one or a few bases , or " letters " , in the biochemical code that programs cellular activity .
and for many years , scientists have also been able to look through microscopes to see very large-scale abnormalities that arise when whole dna bundles , or chromosomes , are truncated or duplicated .
but it is only recently that researchers have developed the molecular " tools " to focus on medium-scale variations - at the scale of thousands of dna letters .
big factor this analysis of so-called copy number variation -lrb- cnv -rrb- has now revealed some startling results .
it would seem the assumption that the dna of any two humans is 99.9 % similar in content and identity no longer holds .
the researchers were astonished to locate 1,447 cnvs in nearly 2,900 genes , the starting " templates " written in the dna that are used by cells to make the proteins which drive our bodies .
this is a huge , hitherto unrecognised , level of variation between one individual and the next .
" each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of dna , " said matthew hurles , of the uk 's wellcome trust sanger institute .
" one of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our dna varies in copy number .
we estimate this to be at least 12 % of the genome .
" the copy number variation that researchers had seen before was simply the tip of the iceberg , while the bulk lay submerged , undetected .
we now appreciate the immense contribution of this phenomenon to genetic differences between individuals . "
evolving story the new understanding will change the way in which scientists search for genes involved in disease .
" many examples of diseases resulting from changes in copy number are emerging , " commented charles lee , one of the project 's leaders from brigham and women 's hospital and harvard medical school in boston , us .
" a recent review lists 17 conditions of the nervous system alone - including parkinson 's disease and alzheimer 's disease - that can result from such copy number changes . "
scientists are not sure why the copy variations emerge , but it probably has something to do with the shuffling of genetic material that occurs in the production of eggs and sperm ; the process is prone to errors .
as well as aiding the investigation of disease and the development of new drugs , the research will also inform the study of human evolution , which probes genetic variation in modern populations for what it can say about their relationship to ancestral peoples .

a uk-led team made a detailed analysis of the dna found in 270 people and identified vast regions to be duplicated or even missing .
a great many of these variations are in areas of the genome that would not damage our health , matthew hurles and colleagues told the journal nature .
but others are - and can be shown to play a role in a number of disorders .
" we were certainly surprised ; we expected to find that there would be some variation , but we were n't expecting to find quite this much , " dr hurles told bbc news .
to date , the investigation of the human genome has tended to focus on very small changes in dna that can have deleterious effects - at the scale of just one or a few bases , or " letters " , in the biochemical code that programs cellular activity .
and for many years , scientists have also been able to look through microscopes to see very large-scale abnormalities that arise when whole dna bundles , or chromosomes , are truncated or duplicated .
but it is only recently that researchers have developed the molecular " tools " to focus on medium-scale variations - at the scale of thousands of dna letters .
big factor this analysis of so-called copy number variation -lrb- cnv -rrb- has now revealed some startling results .
it would seem the assumption that the dna of any two humans is 99.9 % similar in content and identity no longer holds .
the researchers were astonished to locate 1,447 cnvs in nearly 2,900 genes , the starting " templates " written in the dna that are used by cells to make the proteins which drive our bodies .
this is a huge , hitherto unrecognised , level of variation between one individual and the next .
" each one of us has a unique pattern of gains and losses of complete sections of dna , " said matthew hurles , of the uk 's wellcome trust sanger institute .
" one of the real surprises of these results was just how much of our dna varies in copy number .
we estimate this to be at least 12 % of the genome .
" the copy number variation that researchers had seen before was simply the tip of the iceberg , while the bulk lay submerged , undetected .
we now appreciate the immense contribution of this phenomenon to genetic differences between individuals . "

chantelle rowlands suffers from a blood disorder which can only be cured by a bone marrow transplant .
a suitable donor has not yet been found and her mother , lynda rowlands , has helped organise a recruitment event for potential donors in rhyl 's town hall .
people will be asked for a blood sample to see if they can donate bone marrow .
chantelle has severe aplastic anaemia - a condition where the bone marrow does not produce enough new cells to replenish the blood , leaving her at risk to infection .
missed school she has regular blood transfusions and takes medication every day , but efforts to find donated bone marrow , which could cure her , have so far failed .
chantelle has not been able to go to school at all this term and missed much of last year .
she said : " i ca n't play with my friends because if they have a cold i 'm not allowed to go near them and i 'm not allowed to go to their houses either .
chantelle 's mother lynda helped organise the donation drive " i ca n't do things that normal children can . "
chantelle , whose father is from pakistan , needs her ideal donor to be mixed race .
she added : " there 's not many mixed-race people on the bone marrow list so we just need mixed race and any other people to come forward .
" it 's not just for me , it 's for other children like me . "
chantelle was born with the blood disorder and needed transfusions from birth , but her condition had eased until earlier this year .
' priceless gift ' her mother , lynda rowlands , said : " she 's always been monitored at the hospital and it was only in the january of this year that she started to go downhill again .
" she was back on blood transfusions to stay alive .
" i just hope and pray that a donor will be found .
with more people coming forward they can save the likes of chantelle and other children . "
" i really would like to appeal for people to come forward to be a donor .
it 's a priceless gift . "

a report by the end violence against women campaign said government work to combat the problem was " patchy " and suffered from a lack of resources .
it added women who needed support faced a " postcode lottery " over services .
women 's minister meg munn said the report failed to acknowledge " real progress " made by the government .
the report comes at the same time as a separate one which criticises the government for failing to provide homeless women with the help they need .
a survey of 160 single homeless women in england by the charity crisis found more than 20 % had become homeless in their attempts to escape domestic violence .
' two out of 10 ' the report by the end violence against women campaign - led by amnesty - says violence against women includes domestic violence , forced marriage , crimes in the name of honour , rape and sexual assault , trafficking , female genital mutilation , sexual harassment and stalking .
in rating its success at tackling these problems , it gave the government an overall score of two out of 10 - last year it awarded the government just one .

it added a failure to develop policies and provide resources for forms of violence beyond domestic violence , such as rape and forced marriage , was also hindering progress .
funding and a lack of services are also highlighted as major problems , with the report noting that since 1984 the number of women-only rape crisis centres in england and wales has more than halved - from 68 to 32 .
' mopping up ' campaign chairwoman professor liz kelly said : " there are many women who are living with the legacies of abuse and can not get help following a sexual assault because there are no services in their area . "
she called for more preventative policies , rather than an approach of " mopping up the problem once it has occurred " .

" these include creating a further 28 specialist domestic violence courts to bring more offenders to justice , opening the first uk human trafficking centre in europe and providing £ 2m for advisers to help women through the justice process , " she said .
she said they also included " building or refurbishing 511 refuge bed spaces for women , introducing a new performance target for local authorities on domestic violence and working with local authorities to set up a further 165 sanctuary schemes in the coming year to enable victims of domestic violence to stay in their own homes .

a report by the end violence against women campaign said government work to combat the problem was " patchy " and suffered from a lack of resources .
it added women who needed support faced a " postcode lottery " over services .
women 's minister meg munn said the report failed to acknowledge " real progress " made by the government .
the report comes at the same time as a separate one which criticises the government for failing to provide homeless women with the help they need .
a survey of 160 single homeless women in england by the charity crisis found more than 20 % had become homeless in their attempts to escape domestic violence .
' two out of 10 ' the report by the end violence against women campaign - led by amnesty - says violence against women includes domestic violence , forced marriage , crimes in the name of honour , rape and sexual assault , trafficking , female genital mutilation , sexual harassment and stalking .
in rating its success at tackling these problems , it gave the government an overall score of two out of 10 - last year it awarded the government just one .

it added a failure to develop policies and provide resources for forms of violence beyond domestic violence , such as rape and forced marriage , was also hindering progress .
funding and a lack of services are also highlighted as major problems , with the report noting that since 1984 the number of women-only rape crisis centres in england and wales has more than halved - from 68 to 32 .
' mopping up ' campaign chairwoman professor liz kelly said : " there are many women who are living with the legacies of abuse and can not get help following a sexual assault because there are no services in their area . "
she called for more preventative policies , rather than an approach of " mopping up the problem once it has occurred " .
the processes we have in place are working - the progress we see on the ground speaks for itself women 's minister meg munn ms munn said the government had been making progress and cited a number of initiatives .
" these include creating a further 28 specialist domestic violence courts to bring more offenders to justice , opening the first uk human trafficking centre in europe and providing £ 2m for advisers to help women through the justice process , " she said .
she said they also included " building or refurbishing 511 refuge bed spaces for women , introducing a new performance target for local authorities on domestic violence and working with local authorities to set up a further 165 sanctuary schemes in the coming year to enable victims of domestic violence to stay in their own homes .

barrowman , topping ratings with the bbc series , and architect scott gill will hold the ceremony at christmas .
pantomime and other commitments meant there were only two possible dates between christmas and new year .
" now it 's all fixed .
it 's going to be at st david 's hotel & spa on 27 december , " barrowman said .
" we 've signed our intent at kensington and chelsea , " he added " it 's going to be just a few people .
we 'll have our close family and friends and the cast of torchwood .
" we 'll have a brunch and buffet , although it can only be between 11 and two as i 'm appearing in pantomime later .
" it 'll be a real family celebration . "
the performer is spending most of his time in cardiff and he loves it the couple have been together 16 years , and as well as a home in cardiff bay , a stone 's throw from the hotel where they will formally commit to each other , they share homes in london and the us .
barrowman , who moved from glasgow to illinois as a child , said : " our relationship was legitimate for us a long time ago .
" we have been spending most of our time together .
the ceremony is because we have the right to be recognised as a couple .
" it forces people who do n't want to recognise same-sex relationships as legitimate ... it forces them to do so . "
barrowman is bringing his family from the us to cardiff to be with him in the busy festive period in which he is also recording a concert for bbc radio .
cocker spaniels the cast of torchwood are waiting to hear whether a second series has been commissioned and barrowman said he should also be reading scripts for the next doctor who series , but they are not ready yet .
" we 're hoping so - we even got higher ratings than little britain - a slap in matt 's -lrb- lucas 's -rrb- face , " joked barrowman .
" it 's something that we all want to do , we 're just finding our feet . "
" i am in cardiff 90 % of the time now and scott spends the weeks in london where he has his own business and comes down to spend the weekend with me . "
and he can not speak highly enough of the adopted welsh home they share with their well-travelled english cocker spaniels penny and lewis .

" i 'm very sad as i should have relished revisiting middle earth with peter again , " the actor wrote on his website .
" it 's hard to imagine any other director matching his achievement in tolkien country . "
jackson refused to discuss working on the hobbit until a dvd royalty dispute with new line cinema was settled .
but new line said it had only " limited time " to make the film and was proceeding without the oscar-winning director .
angry fans the announcement has led to an online petition of 1,100 people asking for jackson to be reinstated .
the petition created calls for the hobbit to be filmed " the way it was meant to be or not at all " .
a website has also been set up urging a boycott of new line , and fans have used weblogs and forums to question the studio 's judgement .
can you imagine someone other than ian mckellen playing gandalf the grey ?
extract from online petition the petition argues that a hobbit movie without peter jackson and his writers and special effects team is not what fans want .
" the characters and scenery will all be new and unfamiliar and props , costumes , and the backdrop of new zealand will all be lost , " it said .
" most likely even the original actors will not sign on to do it - can you imagine someone other than ian mckellen playing gandalf the grey ? "
a user of fan site theonering.net has registered the domain name boycottnewline.com , which links to another petition .
" something must happen to get new line and jackson to talk about the -lsb- legal case -rsb- , which has been hanging over future tolkein-related productions since 2005 , " the owner has written .
" the only way to get new line to budge is to boycott future new line productions until they sit down and hash things out with peter jackson . "
' wrong guy ' before the story emerged this week , there was already a site - thehobbitfilm.com - encouraging fans to ask top studio executives to get on with making the movie with jackson .
it urged people to send letters or postcards because " the only way we are going to reach our goal of having a live-action version of the hobbit from peter jackson and his team is by keeping after the studios who own the rights " .
however , other fans were more relaxed about the way the project was progressing .
" that 's the best news i 've heard concerning peter jackson in about five years , " wrote one person on the ringbearer.org site .
" he 's exactly the wrong guy to handle the hobbit in any way shape or form . "
another , on theonering.net , said : " i 'm sure the hobbit will turn out to be a success even without the help of the great peter jackson . "
a spokesman for distributor mgm told variety newspaper that the matter was " far from closed " , leaving some people hoping jackson would return .
" hopefully they will see the light and involve the two people who have proven worth in telling the stories , " one person wrote in the chatroom at theonering.net.
neither new line nor mgm was available for further comment .

" i 'm very sad as i should have relished revisiting middle earth with peter again , " the actor wrote on his website .
" it 's hard to imagine any other director matching his achievement in tolkien country . "
jackson refused to discuss working on the hobbit until a dvd royalty dispute with new line cinema was settled .
but new line said it had only " limited time " to make the film and was proceeding without the oscar-winning director .
angry fans the announcement has led to an online petition of 1,100 people asking for jackson to be reinstated .
the petition created calls for the hobbit to be filmed " the way it was meant to be or not at all " .
a website has also been set up urging a boycott of new line , and fans have used weblogs and forums to question the studio 's judgement .
can you imagine someone other than ian mckellen playing gandalf the grey ?
extract from online petition the petition argues that a hobbit movie without peter jackson and his writers and special effects team is not what fans want .
" the characters and scenery will all be new and unfamiliar and props , costumes , and the backdrop of new zealand will all be lost , " it said .
" most likely even the original actors will not sign on to do it - can you imagine someone other than ian mckellen playing gandalf the grey ? "
a user of fan site theonering.net has registered the domain name boycottnewline.com , which links to another petition .
" something must happen to get new line and jackson to talk about the -lsb- legal case -rsb- , which has been hanging over future tolkein-related productions since 2005 , " the owner has written .
" the only way to get new line to budge is to boycott future new line productions until they sit down and hash things out with peter jackson . "
' wrong guy ' before the story emerged this week , there was already a site - thehobbitfilm.com - encouraging fans to ask top studio executives to get on with making the movie with jackson .
it urged people to send letters or postcards because " the only way we are going to reach our goal of having a live-action version of the hobbit from peter jackson and his team is by keeping after the studios who own the rights " .
however , other fans were more relaxed about the way the project was progressing .
" that 's the best news i 've heard concerning peter jackson in about five years , " wrote one person on the ringbearer.org site .
" he 's exactly the wrong guy to handle the hobbit in any way shape or form . "
another , on theonering.net , said : " i 'm sure the hobbit will turn out to be a success even without the help of the great peter jackson . "
a spokesman for distributor mgm told variety newspaper that the matter was " far from closed " , leaving some people hoping jackson would return .

the department of health said its targets had been achieved , and 99 % of trusts are providing single sex accommodation .
but patients groups said they were getting an increasing number of calls from people who think they have been in mixed-sex wards .
there appears to be confusion about the definition of the term .
katherine murphy , from the patients association , said there had been 25-30 calls in the last month to the charity 's helpline , mostly from elderly patients , who had been nursed on mixed-sex wards .
andrew lansley said it was not acceptable to claim that partitioned single-sex bays on mixed-sex wards were doing the job .
" if you can be seen by patients of another sex , and they are coming and going past your bed in order to go to the toilet facilities you may not think you have the privacy you want . "
the government pledged to scrap mixed-sex wards when it came to power in 1997 .
more to do health secretary patricia hewitt said most trusts offered single-sex wards , but said more could be done .
most wards in most hospitals do now provide single-sex accommodation and single-sex bathrooms patricia hewitt health secretary she conceded that patients ' experience did not seem to tally with reports on progress from hospitals .
and she said she had asked strategic health authority bosses to carry out checks .
however , she said it was not feasible to expect hospitals to provide single sex facilities in an medical admissions unit , where doctors assess emergency cases before deciding what action to take .
she said that would increase the risk that a patient in dire need could be turned away , simply because they were the wrong sex .
" most wards in most hospitals do now provide single-sex accommodation and single-sex bathrooms .
" but it is clearly not happening everywhere , and it can not happen everywhere in those emergency situations , like medical assessment wards , because we can not have a situation where you turn away a woman because you have only got a male bed left . "
mrs hewitt also accepted that the use of partitioned areas on mixed-sex wards was " not good enough " - but increased patient choice would give people the chance to vote with their feet .
" we have eliminated most of the mixed-sex wards that used to exist , but there is still more to be done . "
dr gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation which represents over 90 % of nhs organisations , said : " where mixed-sex wards do exist , they are often in older hospital buildings or to ensure that specialist care can be provided to groups of patients by hospital staff .
" however , hospitals go to great lengths to make sure that single-sex bays of four or five beds are provided within wards and that single-sex facilities , such as toilets and showers , are provided . "
have you been affected by mixed-sex hospital wards ?
is enough emphasis placed on patient privacy ?
below is a selection of your comments mrs hewitt 's statement that ' increased patient choice would give people the chance to vote with their feet ' reflects complete ignorance of the location of nhs hospitals .
if i vote with my feet , i would need to travel 30 or 40 miles to neighbouring towns .
in cumbria one would have to travel 50 or 80 miles .
another choice is to go private , but for most of us that is an unaffordable option .
get real , mrs hewitt .
ian , oxford recently , having fractured my spine in an accident i was extremely distressed to be admitted to a mixed sex ward .
overworked nurses do not have time to check that curtains are properly pulled .
i was stripped naked each day to be washed , completely unable to move and every day my named nurse was called away several times by senior staff requiring assistance .
often i was exposed to all and sundry till she returned because the curtains did n't meet .
i hated every minute and actually discharged myself as soon as i was allowed to walk by myself .
jenny , canterbury , britain i am 25 and was admitted to hospital for two weeks in august .
i had a private room , within a mixed ward and i have to say being in a mixed ward did lead to an increase in the loss of dignity , which one always feels in hospital .
however , the mix of ages and illness in my ward was a larger problem .
the elderly gentleman in the room next door , kept coming in to my room and at one point actually stole my hairbrush !
karen , oxford , uk my mum is currently in a mixed sex psychiatric ward and to be honest i worry about her being in a weak and vulnerable position with other male psychiatric patients .
i agree that this is the first place single sex wards should become compulsory .
jo , london i think it 's the quality of care that matters .
my son was in a mixed sex ward after major surgery last year and although not ideal i ca n't fault the care he received .
theresa crossley , hornchurch , essex the first place they need to get rid of mixed-sex wards is in acute psychiatric units .
it 's unbelievable to me that people with acute conditions are put into mixed wards without 24hr monitoring .
s. harding , london , uk the ward that i work on as a nurse is mixed , but has single gender bays , and i can honestly say no-one has complained .
we do not accept patients if there is no appropriate bed available , thus we do not have mixed bays .
those who do have issues with mixed gender wards , do they also have issues with being cared for by a nurse or doctor of the opposite gender ?
john collis , loughborough , uk i appreciate the need for mixed acute admissions units .
however it was quite distressing for my 86 year old mother who was admitted with a heart problem to have the confused elderly man in the next bed constantly trying to climb into her bed !
the staff were so busy they just did n't have the time to supervise this poor man .
as for the comment about sex-discrimination and segregation - get real !
these are people at their most vulnerable .
in most situations mixed wards just simply do n't work .
jean , bristol , uk my mother was admitted to hospital earlier this year and the ward was mixed sex .
although she did not say anything i know this did distress her .
sadly she passed away the next day .
being elderly , i know she thought men and women should be in separate wards .
i spent the day she died at the hospital and i was not too pleased by the fact that the man in the next bed was only partially dressed , thankfully we had the curtains around the bed closed .
i think this is unacceptable and should be phased out veronica , reading , uk i was on a mixed sex ward in 2001 when having my knee replaced .
i actually found it more interesting to have both sexes on the ward .
whenever you needed attention from the nurses there were curtains to give privacy .
i am 67 now and would be quite happy to go on a mixed sex ward again .
maureen fullick , high wycombe england having worked in a hospital , being involved with patient and bed allocation , i have to say that , considering the high bed occupancy levels -lrb- usually 92 % in my hospital -rrb- , it simply is n't realistic for whitehall to make such promises .
nursing staff do their best to keep bays single sex , but when bays are mixed , it 's usually because there is no space elsewhere .
nathan , eastbourne if you are staying in hospital it is because you are in need of care .
as long as you get that care that 's all that matters .
could n't that money be spent on something better ?
greig aitken , edinburgh i have had several stays in hospital and been on both single and mixed sex wards .
whilst single sex wards are perfectly fine , i would rather be on a mixed sex ward .
after all , we do not live in a single sex environment and i find a mixed sex ward more natural .
kevin , suffolk most wards i 've seen have bays for men and women separately .
it does n't make much sense to have complete single sex wards .
unless the right amount of men and women fall ill simultaneously , will people be refused treatment or have it delayed because they 're the wrong gender for the available bed ?
you ca n't expect the standards of private healthcare from a public healthcare system .
we do n't pay enough for that kind of extravagance .
dave mckenzie , canterbury , kent unfortunately i had pneumonia last year and had to endure mixed wards in the bolton royal hospital .
i could not get out of hospital fast enough and went home early to recuperate .
very off putting when you are ill !
mavis fairhurst , bolton , lancashire , uk my father was in a mixed ward last year in the royal free hospital in hampstead after a stroke .
it was a general geriatric unit with a specialist stroke section , and he was there on and off for four months , in mixed-sex wards mostly .
i think this is completely unacceptable and should be phased out immediately .
ian lush , london , greater london i was on a mixed ward when i was admitted to hospital as an emergency a month ago .
i was too ill and drugged up to care whether the other patients in the ward were male or female , but i was glad to share a room with another woman and not a man .
i 'm not sure if i would change my mind if i were there for longer .
jo , cambridge , uk i have been in partitioned wards more than once and i do n't see what the problem is to be honest .
i do n't feel that being surrounded only by women makes it more private at all .
the only way something can be private is if you are on your own .
if you are surrounded by people it does n't matter what sex they are .
i thought people were against sex-discrimination and segregation these days ?

and she said she had asked strategic health authority bosses to carry out checks .
however , she said it was not feasible to expect hospitals to provide single sex facilities in an medical admissions unit , where doctors assess emergency cases before deciding what action to take .
she said that would increase the risk that a patient in dire need could be turned away , simply because they were the wrong sex .
" most wards in most hospitals do now provide single-sex accommodation and single-sex bathrooms .
" but it is clearly not happening everywhere , and it can not happen everywhere in those emergency situations , like medical assessment wards , because we can not have a situation where you turn away a woman because you have only got a male bed left . "
mrs hewitt also accepted that the use of partitioned areas on mixed-sex wards was " not good enough " - but increased patient choice would give people the chance to vote with their feet .
" we have eliminated most of the mixed-sex wards that used to exist , but there is still more to be done . "
dr gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation which represents over 90 % of nhs organisations , said : " where mixed-sex wards do exist , they are often in older hospital buildings or to ensure that specialist care can be provided to groups of patients by hospital staff .
" however , hospitals go to great lengths to make sure that single-sex bays of four or five beds are provided within wards and that single-sex facilities , such as toilets and showers , are provided . "
have you been affected by mixed-sex hospital wards ?
is enough emphasis placed on patient privacy ?
below is a selection of your comments mrs hewitt 's statement that ' increased patient choice would give people the chance to vote with their feet ' reflects complete ignorance of the location of nhs hospitals .
if i vote with my feet , i would need to travel 30 or 40 miles to neighbouring towns .
in cumbria one would have to travel 50 or 80 miles .
another choice is to go private , but for most of us that is an unaffordable option .
get real , mrs hewitt .
ian , oxford recently , having fractured my spine in an accident i was extremely distressed to be admitted to a mixed sex ward .
overworked nurses do not have time to check that curtains are properly pulled .
i was stripped naked each day to be washed , completely unable to move and every day my named nurse was called away several times by senior staff requiring assistance .
often i was exposed to all and sundry till she returned because the curtains did n't meet .
i hated every minute and actually discharged myself as soon as i was allowed to walk by myself .
jenny , canterbury , britain i am 25 and was admitted to hospital for two weeks in august .
i had a private room , within a mixed ward and i have to say being in a mixed ward did lead to an increase in the loss of dignity , which one always feels in hospital .
however , the mix of ages and illness in my ward was a larger problem .
the elderly gentleman in the room next door , kept coming in to my room and at one point actually stole my hairbrush !
karen , oxford , uk my mum is currently in a mixed sex psychiatric ward and to be honest i worry about her being in a weak and vulnerable position with other male psychiatric patients .
i agree that this is the first place single sex wards should become compulsory .
jo , london i think it 's the quality of care that matters .
my son was in a mixed sex ward after major surgery last year and although not ideal i ca n't fault the care he received .
theresa crossley , hornchurch , essex the first place they need to get rid of mixed-sex wards is in acute psychiatric units .
it 's unbelievable to me that people with acute conditions are put into mixed wards without 24hr monitoring .
s. harding , london , uk the ward that i work on as a nurse is mixed , but has single gender bays , and i can honestly say no-one has complained .
we do not accept patients if there is no appropriate bed available , thus we do not have mixed bays .
those who do have issues with mixed gender wards , do they also have issues with being cared for by a nurse or doctor of the opposite gender ?
john collis , loughborough , uk i appreciate the need for mixed acute admissions units .
however it was quite distressing for my 86 year old mother who was admitted with a heart problem to have the confused elderly man in the next bed constantly trying to climb into her bed !
the staff were so busy they just did n't have the time to supervise this poor man .
as for the comment about sex-discrimination and segregation - get real !
these are people at their most vulnerable .
in most situations mixed wards just simply do n't work .
jean , bristol , uk my mother was admitted to hospital earlier this year and the ward was mixed sex .
although she did not say anything i know this did distress her .
sadly she passed away the next day .
being elderly , i know she thought men and women should be in separate wards .
i spent the day she died at the hospital and i was not too pleased by the fact that the man in the next bed was only partially dressed , thankfully we had the curtains around the bed closed .
i think this is unacceptable and should be phased out veronica , reading , uk i was on a mixed sex ward in 2001 when having my knee replaced .
i actually found it more interesting to have both sexes on the ward .
whenever you needed attention from the nurses there were curtains to give privacy .
i am 67 now and would be quite happy to go on a mixed sex ward again .
maureen fullick , high wycombe england having worked in a hospital , being involved with patient and bed allocation , i have to say that , considering the high bed occupancy levels -lrb- usually 92 % in my hospital -rrb- , it simply is n't realistic for whitehall to make such promises .
nursing staff do their best to keep bays single sex , but when bays are mixed , it 's usually because there is no space elsewhere .
nathan , eastbourne if you are staying in hospital it is because you are in need of care .
as long as you get that care that 's all that matters .
could n't that money be spent on something better ?
greig aitken , edinburgh i have had several stays in hospital and been on both single and mixed sex wards .
whilst single sex wards are perfectly fine , i would rather be on a mixed sex ward .
after all , we do not live in a single sex environment and i find a mixed sex ward more natural .
kevin , suffolk most wards i 've seen have bays for men and women separately .
it does n't make much sense to have complete single sex wards .
unless the right amount of men and women fall ill simultaneously , will people be refused treatment or have it delayed because they 're the wrong gender for the available bed ?
you ca n't expect the standards of private healthcare from a public healthcare system .
we do n't pay enough for that kind of extravagance .
dave mckenzie , canterbury , kent unfortunately i had pneumonia last year and had to endure mixed wards in the bolton royal hospital .
i could not get out of hospital fast enough and went home early to recuperate .
very off putting when you are ill !
mavis fairhurst , bolton , lancashire , uk my father was in a mixed ward last year in the royal free hospital in hampstead after a stroke .
it was a general geriatric unit with a specialist stroke section , and he was there on and off for four months , in mixed-sex wards mostly .
i think this is completely unacceptable and should be phased out immediately .
ian lush , london , greater london i was on a mixed ward when i was admitted to hospital as an emergency a month ago .
i was too ill and drugged up to care whether the other patients in the ward were male or female , but i was glad to share a room with another woman and not a man .
i 'm not sure if i would change my mind if i were there for longer .
jo , cambridge , uk i have been in partitioned wards more than once and i do n't see what the problem is to be honest .
i do n't feel that being surrounded only by women makes it more private at all .
the only way something can be private is if you are on your own .
if you are surrounded by people it does n't matter what sex they are .
i thought people were against sex-discrimination and segregation these days ?

the department of health said its targets had been achieved , and 99 % of trusts are providing single sex accommodation .
but patients groups said they were getting an increasing number of calls from people who think they have been in mixed-sex wards .
there appears to be confusion about the definition of the term .
katherine murphy , from the patients association , said there had been 25-30 calls in the last month to the charity 's helpline , mostly from elderly patients , who had been nursed on mixed-sex wards .
andrew lansley said it was not acceptable to claim that partitioned single-sex bays on mixed-sex wards were doing the job .
" if you can be seen by patients of another sex , and they are coming and going past your bed in order to go to the toilet facilities you may not think you have the privacy you want . "
the government pledged to scrap mixed-sex wards when it came to power in 1997 .
