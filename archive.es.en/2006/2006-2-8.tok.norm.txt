up to 700 demonstrators rampaged through the northern afghan city of maymana tuesday , throwing stones at a un office and a compound of a reconstruction project led by norwegian troops . mounting concern the united nations , european union and the organization for the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish embassy in syria was set afire by angry demonstrators " we are deeply alarmed at the repercussions of the publication in denmark several months ago of insulting caricatures of the prophet mohammed and their subsequent republication by some other european newspapers , and at the violent acts that have occurred in reaction to them , " representatives of the three organizations said in a joint statement . " we fully uphold the right of free speech .
but we understand the deep hurt and widespread indignation felt in the muslim world , " said the statement signed by un chief kofi annan , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and oic secretary general ekmeleddin ihsanoglu . " we believe freedom of the press entails responsibility and discretion and should respect the beliefs and tenets of all religions , " it added . the statement , however , also stressed that " the recent violent acts surpass the limits of peaceful protest , " and specifically condemned " the deplorable attacks on diplomatic missions that have occurred in damascus , beirut and elsewhere . " it called on authorities of all countries to " protect all diplomatic premises and foreign citizens against unlawful attack . " " these events make the need for renewed dialogue , among and between communities of different faiths and authorities of different countries , all the more urgent , " the statement said . us lends support to besieged denmark meanwhile us president george w. bush on tuesday assured danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of his " support and solidarity " over violence sparked by caricatures of the prophet mohammed , the white house said . british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac had previously called rasmussen after the attacks on danish missions , raising spirits in copenhagen which had been feeling rather isolated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen has been under immense pressure " the president expressed support and solidarity with denmark in the aftermath of the violence against the danish and other diplomatic facilities , " spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters . " obviously this support from major countries lifts some of the pressure and soothes us , especially when it comes from the americans and british , who slightly disappointed us earlier by their criticism and lack of solidarity , " said one danish diplomat . meanwhile , the european union slammed iran 's decision to suspend trade with denmark , and said it was studying a response . violence continues elsewhere in the muslim world , there were few signs of the violence abating . iranian demonstrators briefly stormed the danish embassy in tehran tuesday and stoned the norwegian mission . in the pakistani city of peshawar nearly 3,000 people on tuesday attended a rally called by the islamist government of north west frontier province , shouting " hang the cartoonists ! " demonstrators in dhaka burned a flag during a protest organized by the jamaat-e-islami , the second largest party in bangladesh 's four-party coalition government . the cartoons were " the straw that broke the camel 's back " among muslims , the palestinian authority 's envoy to the eu said . many muslims were pushed " to the limit " by the drawings , which had to be seen against an " islamophobe context , " said leila shahid . " if the same story had happened 20 years ago , there would not have been 300 people in the street in the whole world , " she told a debate in brussels .
" but we are faced with islamophobe language worldwide .
it is the straw which broke the camel 's back , " she said . german fm says muslim anger exploited but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the controversy might have been exploited to incite unrest in muslim countries , including iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish flags have been burnt symbolically in several countries " in the last few days i have had the impression that in many arab countries the cartoon controversy is being used as means to rouse emotions , " steinmeier told reporters . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency , called for a dialogue with islamic countries to stop the violence . she asked eu foreign policy chief javier solana to meet in jeddah with the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which groups 57 islamic countries , to discuss ways to end the tension . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?
goleo watchers are perturbed that the furry idol appears alongside his musical team on his first hit record sans pille . goleo 's loyal ball , who announced the lion 's arrival on the global stage , may be on the cover of the single but his duties as vocalist seem to be surplus to requirements .
it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .
it could be the final act in what could turn out to be one of the most acrimonious splits in showbiz history ; one to rival george michael leaving wham or even the third break-up of modern talking . dw-world predicts a warts-and-all expose entitled " talking balls : pille 's story " in the shops by christmas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mascots play the shame game is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .
the daily claims that the contest would reveal just how serious the west really is about the freedom of the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian protestors burn danish flags in front of the austrian embassy in tehran but erler said he believes that the iranian government is behind the holocaust competition , as it is clearly capitalizing on the current conflict for its own political purposes . he added that it 's not a surprise to find this attitude from the iranian leadership around president mahmoud ahmadinejad who himself denies israel 's right to statehood and claims the holocaust is an invention of zionism . bahman nirumand , an exiled iranian journalist living in germany , said that the intercultural conflict is playing into the hands of iranian fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's decision to resume nuclear research has disappeared from headlines in recent days " i think the iranian government is using every possible pretext to divert attention away from the problems it 's facing at present , " he said .
" there 's this huge row over the country 's nuclear program and tehran just ca n't get on top of it . " the intercultural conflict between the west and muslim countries is a welcome instrument to shift the focus away from internal problems , " he said . failure of dialogue ? the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said he 's shocked at the holocaust cartoon contest which in his view will exacerbate the current conflict in a frightening manner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of some of the six million victims of the holocaust hang on the walls at yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem he added that every attempt to belittle the horrors of the holocaust was simply heinous .
spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

against the background of heightened tensions between the western and muslim worlds , bavaria 's conservative interior minister , günther beckstein , has urged the government to revise its security concept for this year world soccer cup in germany . he called for certain travel restrictions with regard to potential visitors from muslim nations and iran in particular . beckstein said security officials had to look very carefully at who 'd be coming to germany , assuming that not everyone might be just a sports fanatic , but a radical fanatic of a political nature . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier over the conflict about mohammed cartoons published in europe .

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .

spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on religion germany 's jewish community begins search for new president " germany should lead fight against anti-semitism " intelligent design debate arrives in germany germany 's pope germany -pipe- 08.02.2006 german muslim group elects islam convert for top post großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's appointment comes amid the raging controversy on mohammed cartoons for the first time the central council of muslims , one of germany 's largest muslim organizations , has a chairman of german origin - ayyub axel köhler who converted to islam in 1963 . ayyub axel köhler succeeds nadeem elyas , chairman of germany 's central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- since the organization 's founding in 1994 . the zmd remains one of the best-known muslim umbrella groups in germany and according to its own estimates has around 800,000 members .
experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '
we ca n't achieve anything with violence anyway , " köhler said . " we have to see to it that we change something in our society when it comes to relations with each other , " he added . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim .

" they violate the dignity of muslims .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2006 german companies develop appetite for overseas acquisitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoemaker adidas sprinted ahead when it took over reebok last year us investors taking over germany 's largest private tv channel or a british consortium buying a berlin paper have made headlines in germany .
meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .

but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?
goleo watchers are perturbed that the furry idol appears alongside his musical team on his first hit record sans pille . goleo 's loyal ball , who announced the lion 's arrival on the global stage , may be on the cover of the single but his duties as vocalist seem to be surplus to requirements .
it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .
it could be the final act in what could turn out to be one of the most acrimonious splits in showbiz history ; one to rival george michael leaving wham or even the third break-up of modern talking . dw-world predicts a warts-and-all expose entitled " talking balls : pille 's story " in the shops by christmas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mascots play the shame game is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?

but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .

for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

they are afraid that the volume of traffic will soar if the new berlin airport is built .
even their extra thick windows would n't provide them with enough protection , barbara simon said . " we 've been living here for quite some time and we actually wanted to grow old in this house , " she said .
" now that seems to become impossible with this level of noise that makes us all sick .
but we are determined to fight back . " court to review model complai n ts that 's why the simons have filed a suit against the airport - together with about 4,000 of their neighbors from five villages situated near the building site .
over the next two weeks , germany 's highest administrative court will hear about 120 of them , chosen as representative of the various issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blueprint of the proposed airport " the building plan alone comprises several thousand pages , " said eckehard thien , the court 's president .
" not to mention the numerous files attached to it .
in addition , there is a series of surveys that have been made on various aspects of the project .
so this is really going to become a complex matter . " but the plaintiffs have already recorded one small victory .
for the past year , a court injunction has stopped building work because the airport planners failed to give due respect to peoples ' concerns . project plagued by delays it 's yet another delay for the project , which has been in planning for the past 14 years .
its supporters argue that the capital berlin is a top attraction for visitors .
about 15 million guests came here last year alone which is a new record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport was meant to be closed years ago , but is still in operation more than 22 million passengers are expected for the near future .
but berlin 's tegel airport is overcrowded and there is no space to extend it .
and the legendary tempelhof airport near the center of the city has been running up huge losses in recent years . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit is convinced that there is no alternative to building a large airport on the outskirts of the city . " we 've been trying to strike a balance between the interests of the local residents and the public interest in building such a big new infrastructure project , " he said .
" the new airport will not only provide better connections to the rest of the world , but it 'll also create up to 40 thousand new jobs . " klaus and barbara simon said they appreciate these arguments .
but they ca n't understand why the international airport has to be built near them .
they are now hoping to persuade the judges of the merits of their case in order to preserve what they see as an idyllic part of germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new berlin airport prepares for take-off after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong .

in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .
the vatica n stripped kü n g , who was bor n i n switzerla n d , of his lice n se to teach i n 1979 whe n he expressed doubts about the co n cept of papal i n fallibility .
last fall , pope be n edict xvi i n vited the 77-year-old kü n g , who taught at the u n iversity of tübi n ge n u n til his retireme n t i n 1996 , to the vatica n for talks . dw-world : the viole n t protests i n ma n y arabic cou n tries over the mohammed caricatures are co n ti n ui n g .
i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .
the vatica n stripped kü n g , who was bor n i n switzerla n d , of his lice n se to teach i n 1979 whe n he expressed doubts about the co n cept of papal i n fallibility .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany -pipe- 08.02.2006 " the west has made many mistakes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans küng , catholic theologian and frequent church critic theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .
the vatica n stripped kü n g , who was bor n i n switzerla n d , of his lice n se to teach i n 1979 whe n he expressed doubts about the co n cept of papal i n fallibility .
last fall , pope be n edict xvi i n vited the 77-year-old kü n g , who taught at the u n iversity of tübi n ge n u n til his retireme n t i n 1996 , to the vatica n for talks . dw-world : the viole n t protests i n ma n y arabic cou n tries over the mohammed caricatures are co n ti n ui n g .
i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .

experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .

meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2006 german companies develop appetite for overseas acquisitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoemaker adidas sprinted ahead when it took over reebok last year us investors taking over germany 's largest private tv channel or a british consortium buying a berlin paper have made headlines in germany .
meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

up to 700 demonstrators rampaged through the northern afghan city of maymana tuesday , throwing stones at a un office and a compound of a reconstruction project led by norwegian troops . mounting concern the united nations , european union and the organization for the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish embassy in syria was set afire by angry demonstrators " we are deeply alarmed at the repercussions of the publication in denmark several months ago of insulting caricatures of the prophet mohammed and their subsequent republication by some other european newspapers , and at the violent acts that have occurred in reaction to them , " representatives of the three organizations said in a joint statement . " we fully uphold the right of free speech .
but we understand the deep hurt and widespread indignation felt in the muslim world , " said the statement signed by un chief kofi annan , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and oic secretary general ekmeleddin ihsanoglu . " we believe freedom of the press entails responsibility and discretion and should respect the beliefs and tenets of all religions , " it added . the statement , however , also stressed that " the recent violent acts surpass the limits of peaceful protest , " and specifically condemned " the deplorable attacks on diplomatic missions that have occurred in damascus , beirut and elsewhere . " it called on authorities of all countries to " protect all diplomatic premises and foreign citizens against unlawful attack . " " these events make the need for renewed dialogue , among and between communities of different faiths and authorities of different countries , all the more urgent , " the statement said . us lends support to besieged denmark meanwhile us president george w. bush on tuesday assured danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen of his " support and solidarity " over violence sparked by caricatures of the prophet mohammed , the white house said . british prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac had previously called rasmussen after the attacks on danish missions , raising spirits in copenhagen which had been feeling rather isolated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister rasmussen has been under immense pressure " the president expressed support and solidarity with denmark in the aftermath of the violence against the danish and other diplomatic facilities , " spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters . " obviously this support from major countries lifts some of the pressure and soothes us , especially when it comes from the americans and british , who slightly disappointed us earlier by their criticism and lack of solidarity , " said one danish diplomat . meanwhile , the european union slammed iran 's decision to suspend trade with denmark , and said it was studying a response . violence continues elsewhere in the muslim world , there were few signs of the violence abating . iranian demonstrators briefly stormed the danish embassy in tehran tuesday and stoned the norwegian mission . in the pakistani city of peshawar nearly 3,000 people on tuesday attended a rally called by the islamist government of north west frontier province , shouting " hang the cartoonists ! " demonstrators in dhaka burned a flag during a protest organized by the jamaat-e-islami , the second largest party in bangladesh 's four-party coalition government . the cartoons were " the straw that broke the camel 's back " among muslims , the palestinian authority 's envoy to the eu said . many muslims were pushed " to the limit " by the drawings , which had to be seen against an " islamophobe context , " said leila shahid . " if the same story had happened 20 years ago , there would not have been 300 people in the street in the whole world , " she told a debate in brussels .
" but we are faced with islamophobe language worldwide .
it is the straw which broke the camel 's back , " she said . german fm says muslim anger exploited but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the controversy might have been exploited to incite unrest in muslim countries , including iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish flags have been burnt symbolically in several countries " in the last few days i have had the impression that in many arab countries the cartoon controversy is being used as means to rouse emotions , " steinmeier told reporters . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency , called for a dialogue with islamic countries to stop the violence . she asked eu foreign policy chief javier solana to meet in jeddah with the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which groups 57 islamic countries , to discuss ways to end the tension . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

they are afraid that the volume of traffic will soar if the new berlin airport is built .
even their extra thick windows would n't provide them with enough protection , barbara simon said . " we 've been living here for quite some time and we actually wanted to grow old in this house , " she said .
" now that seems to become impossible with this level of noise that makes us all sick .
but we are determined to fight back . " court to review model complai n ts that 's why the simons have filed a suit against the airport - together with about 4,000 of their neighbors from five villages situated near the building site .
over the next two weeks , germany 's highest administrative court will hear about 120 of them , chosen as representative of the various issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blueprint of the proposed airport " the building plan alone comprises several thousand pages , " said eckehard thien , the court 's president .
" not to mention the numerous files attached to it .
in addition , there is a series of surveys that have been made on various aspects of the project .
so this is really going to become a complex matter . " but the plaintiffs have already recorded one small victory .
for the past year , a court injunction has stopped building work because the airport planners failed to give due respect to peoples ' concerns . project plagued by delays it 's yet another delay for the project , which has been in planning for the past 14 years .
its supporters argue that the capital berlin is a top attraction for visitors .
about 15 million guests came here last year alone which is a new record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport was meant to be closed years ago , but is still in operation more than 22 million passengers are expected for the near future .
but berlin 's tegel airport is overcrowded and there is no space to extend it .
and the legendary tempelhof airport near the center of the city has been running up huge losses in recent years . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit is convinced that there is no alternative to building a large airport on the outskirts of the city . " we 've been trying to strike a balance between the interests of the local residents and the public interest in building such a big new infrastructure project , " he said .
" the new airport will not only provide better connections to the rest of the world , but it 'll also create up to 40 thousand new jobs . " klaus and barbara simon said they appreciate these arguments .
but they ca n't understand why the international airport has to be built near them .
they are now hoping to persuade the judges of the merits of their case in order to preserve what they see as an idyllic part of germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new berlin airport prepares for take-off after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong .

but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?
goleo watchers are perturbed that the furry idol appears alongside his musical team on his first hit record sans pille . goleo 's loyal ball , who announced the lion 's arrival on the global stage , may be on the cover of the single but his duties as vocalist seem to be surplus to requirements .
it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .
it could be the final act in what could turn out to be one of the most acrimonious splits in showbiz history ; one to rival george michael leaving wham or even the third break-up of modern talking . dw-world predicts a warts-and-all expose entitled " talking balls : pille 's story " in the shops by christmas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mascots play the shame game is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .
the daily claims that the contest would reveal just how serious the west really is about the freedom of the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian protestors burn danish flags in front of the austrian embassy in tehran but erler said he believes that the iranian government is behind the holocaust competition , as it is clearly capitalizing on the current conflict for its own political purposes . he added that it 's not a surprise to find this attitude from the iranian leadership around president mahmoud ahmadinejad who himself denies israel 's right to statehood and claims the holocaust is an invention of zionism . bahman nirumand , an exiled iranian journalist living in germany , said that the intercultural conflict is playing into the hands of iranian fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's decision to resume nuclear research has disappeared from headlines in recent days " i think the iranian government is using every possible pretext to divert attention away from the problems it 's facing at present , " he said .

" the intercultural conflict between the west and muslim countries is a welcome instrument to shift the focus away from internal problems , " he said . failure of dialogue ? the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said he 's shocked at the holocaust cartoon contest which in his view will exacerbate the current conflict in a frightening manner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of some of the six million victims of the holocaust hang on the walls at yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem he added that every attempt to belittle the horrors of the holocaust was simply heinous .
spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

against the background of heightened tensions between the western and muslim worlds , bavaria 's conservative interior minister , günther beckstein , has urged the government to revise its security concept for this year world soccer cup in germany . he called for certain travel restrictions with regard to potential visitors from muslim nations and iran in particular . beckstein said security officials had to look very carefully at who 'd be coming to germany , assuming that not everyone might be just a sports fanatic , but a radical fanatic of a political nature . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier over the conflict about mohammed cartoons published in europe .

spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : offsides from the fringe when baring it all is not enough world cup host city residents told to behave germany 's mascots play the shame game beate uhse loses its world cup buzz news -pipe- 08.02.2006 could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : the dynamic duo in one of their increasingly rare appearances together he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?
goleo watchers are perturbed that the furry idol appears alongside his musical team on his first hit record sans pille . goleo 's loyal ball , who announced the lion 's arrival on the global stage , may be on the cover of the single but his duties as vocalist seem to be surplus to requirements .
it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .
it could be the final act in what could turn out to be one of the most acrimonious splits in showbiz history ; one to rival george michael leaving wham or even the third break-up of modern talking . dw-world predicts a warts-and-all expose entitled " talking balls : pille 's story " in the shops by christmas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mascots play the shame game is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2006 german companies develop appetite for overseas acquisitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german shoemaker adidas sprinted ahead when it took over reebok last year us investors taking over germany 's largest private tv channel or a british consortium buying a berlin paper have made headlines in germany .
meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .

" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .

" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2006 wto rules on transatlantic food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans hope the ruling helps them to just say no to gmos the world trade organization said tuesday that the eu and six member nations broke trading rules by imposing a moratorium on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops and foods in a landmark decision . on one side of the controversy is the eu , which has a long aversion to genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- and strict policies governing imports .
on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .
the vatica n stripped kü n g , who was bor n i n switzerla n d , of his lice n se to teach i n 1979 whe n he expressed doubts about the co n cept of papal i n fallibility .
last fall , pope be n edict xvi i n vited the 77-year-old kü n g , who taught at the u n iversity of tübi n ge n u n til his retireme n t i n 1996 , to the vatica n for talks . dw-world : the viole n t protests i n ma n y arabic cou n tries over the mohammed caricatures are co n ti n ui n g .
i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : cartoons that shook the world europe no stranger to blasphemy opinion : dialogue between cultures more important than ever germany calls for dialogue of cultures amid cartoon conflict europe concerned by rising violence over mohammed cartoons germany -pipe- 08.02.2006 " the west has made many mistakes " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans küng , catholic theologian and frequent church critic theologian hans küng says the west carries some responsibility for the violence over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .
the vatica n stripped kü n g , who was bor n i n switzerla n d , of his lice n se to teach i n 1979 whe n he expressed doubts about the co n cept of papal i n fallibility .
last fall , pope be n edict xvi i n vited the 77-year-old kü n g , who taught at the u n iversity of tübi n ge n u n til his retireme n t i n 1996 , to the vatica n for talks . dw-world : the viole n t protests i n ma n y arabic cou n tries over the mohammed caricatures are co n ti n ui n g .
i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

up to 700 demonstrators rampaged through the northern afghan city of maymana tuesday , throwing stones at a un office and a compound of a reconstruction project led by norwegian troops . mounting concern the united nations , european union and the organization for the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish embassy in syria was set afire by angry demonstrators " we are deeply alarmed at the repercussions of the publication in denmark several months ago of insulting caricatures of the prophet mohammed and their subsequent republication by some other european newspapers , and at the violent acts that have occurred in reaction to them , " representatives of the three organizations said in a joint statement . " we fully uphold the right of free speech .
but we understand the deep hurt and widespread indignation felt in the muslim world , " said the statement signed by un chief kofi annan , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and oic secretary general ekmeleddin ihsanoglu . " we believe freedom of the press entails responsibility and discretion and should respect the beliefs and tenets of all religions , " it added . the statement , however , also stressed that " the recent violent acts surpass the limits of peaceful protest , " and specifically condemned " the deplorable attacks on diplomatic missions that have occurred in damascus , beirut and elsewhere .

" if the same story had happened 20 years ago , there would not have been 300 people in the street in the whole world , " she told a debate in brussels .
" but we are faced with islamophobe language worldwide .
it is the straw which broke the camel 's back , " she said . german fm says muslim anger exploited but german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the controversy might have been exploited to incite unrest in muslim countries , including iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish flags have been burnt symbolically in several countries " in the last few days i have had the impression that in many arab countries the cartoon controversy is being used as means to rouse emotions , " steinmeier told reporters . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency , called for a dialogue with islamic countries to stop the violence . she asked eu foreign policy chief javier solana to meet in jeddah with the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which groups 57 islamic countries , to discuss ways to end the tension . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

" this report clearly shows that the movement of free workers has not had disruptive effects on the labour market " of the existing 15 eu countries before the " big bang " enlargement , " said eu jobs commissioner vladimir spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla 's czech countrymen still can not work freely in germany and other eu states " quite the contrary , individual countries and europe as a whole has benefited from it , " he added , presenting a report on movement of workers over the last 20 months . most " old europe " governments have kept their doors shut to potential cheap labor from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia since 2004 . curbi n g i n flux for seve n years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polish plumber " piotr adamski tried to alleviate french fears as part of an image campaign " polish plumbers " has been used as shorthand by critics to describe the typical kind of worker who would arrive in western europe able to undercut local rivals because of the relative poverty of the eu newcomer states . under terms of the enlargement , eu countries were allowed to maintain transitional curbs on workers from central europe , initially for a period of two years but potentially for up to seven years . the 12 countries that decided to do so will have until the end of april to decide whether to lift the restrictions , keep them in place for a few years or make them more flexible , for example , by limiting them to certain sectors . austria , germa n y keep borders closed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles celebrated eu membership in 2004 but will still have to wait years before they can work everywhere in the bloc austria and germany , which border many of the new states , have already said they will not be changing policy now .
finland and spain , on the other hand , appear ready to lift the restrictions . others , like belgium , france , luxembourg and the netherlands have not yet taken a clear public stance . the eu commission did not make any specific recommendation to the 12 eu states that still have their doors closed .
but its report made brussels ' position clear . " we have n't seen any catastrophic tendencies " in the three countries that opened their borders , said spidla , adding that new workers " have filled in gaps on the labor market " in britain , ireland and sweden . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hails open door policy for newcomer workers only three eu states adopted an open door policy towards workers from new member states following the bloc 's enlargement in 2004 - but according to the european commission , it 's a policy that 's served them well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2006 wto rules on transatlantic food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans hope the ruling helps them to just say no to gmos the world trade organization said tuesday that the eu and six member nations broke trading rules by imposing a moratorium on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops and foods in a landmark decision . on one side of the controversy is the eu , which has a long aversion to genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- and strict policies governing imports .
on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

" we want to keep jobs in germany , " said the chief negotiator for the employers , heinrich fischer . " wage increases of 5 percent would lead to an exodus of jobs . " ig metall deputy chief berthold huber insisted on german public television that the union 's demands were manageable . even small and medium-sized companies , which make up most of the sector , had booked strong earnings in the past few years , huber said . union wants rapid agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're still working - for now ig metall has insisted it wants to reach a rapid agreement and the union 's chief jürgen peters urged employers to table an offer before the four-week truce period , where any sort of industrial action is banned , ends . huber insisted the unions were not hell-bent on confrontation . " but if there 's no other way , we 'll know how to defend ourselves , " huber said . the current sector-wide wage agreement runs until feb .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

" this report clearly shows that the movement of free workers has not had disruptive effects on the labour market " of the existing 15 eu countries before the " big bang " enlargement , " said eu jobs commissioner vladimir spidla . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla 's czech countrymen still can not work freely in germany and other eu states " quite the contrary , individual countries and europe as a whole has benefited from it , " he added , presenting a report on movement of workers over the last 20 months . most " old europe " governments have kept their doors shut to potential cheap labor from the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia since 2004 . curbi n g i n flux for seve n years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " polish plumber " piotr adamski tried to alleviate french fears as part of an image campaign " polish plumbers " has been used as shorthand by critics to describe the typical kind of worker who would arrive in western europe able to undercut local rivals because of the relative poverty of the eu newcomer states . under terms of the enlargement , eu countries were allowed to maintain transitional curbs on workers from central europe , initially for a period of two years but potentially for up to seven years . the 12 countries that decided to do so will have until the end of april to decide whether to lift the restrictions , keep them in place for a few years or make them more flexible , for example , by limiting them to certain sectors . austria , germa n y keep borders closed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles celebrated eu membership in 2004 but will still have to wait years before they can work everywhere in the bloc austria and germany , which border many of the new states , have already said they will not be changing policy now .
finland and spain , on the other hand , appear ready to lift the restrictions . others , like belgium , france , luxembourg and the netherlands have not yet taken a clear public stance . the eu commission did not make any specific recommendation to the 12 eu states that still have their doors closed .
but its report made brussels ' position clear . " we have n't seen any catastrophic tendencies " in the three countries that opened their borders , said spidla , adding that new workers " have filled in gaps on the labor market " in britain , ireland and sweden . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hails open door policy for newcomer workers only three eu states adopted an open door policy towards workers from new member states following the bloc 's enlargement in 2004 - but according to the european commission , it 's a policy that 's served them well .

they are afraid that the volume of traffic will soar if the new berlin airport is built .
even their extra thick windows would n't provide them with enough protection , barbara simon said . " we 've been living here for quite some time and we actually wanted to grow old in this house , " she said .
" now that seems to become impossible with this level of noise that makes us all sick .
but we are determined to fight back . " court to review model complai n ts that 's why the simons have filed a suit against the airport - together with about 4,000 of their neighbors from five villages situated near the building site .
over the next two weeks , germany 's highest administrative court will hear about 120 of them , chosen as representative of the various issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a blueprint of the proposed airport " the building plan alone comprises several thousand pages , " said eckehard thien , the court 's president .
" not to mention the numerous files attached to it .
in addition , there is a series of surveys that have been made on various aspects of the project .
so this is really going to become a complex matter . " but the plaintiffs have already recorded one small victory .
for the past year , a court injunction has stopped building work because the airport planners failed to give due respect to peoples ' concerns . project plagued by delays it 's yet another delay for the project , which has been in planning for the past 14 years .
its supporters argue that the capital berlin is a top attraction for visitors .
about 15 million guests came here last year alone which is a new record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport was meant to be closed years ago , but is still in operation more than 22 million passengers are expected for the near future .
but berlin 's tegel airport is overcrowded and there is no space to extend it .
and the legendary tempelhof airport near the center of the city has been running up huge losses in recent years . berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit is convinced that there is no alternative to building a large airport on the outskirts of the city . " we 've been trying to strike a balance between the interests of the local residents and the public interest in building such a big new infrastructure project , " he said .
" the new airport will not only provide better connections to the rest of the world , but it 'll also create up to 40 thousand new jobs . " klaus and barbara simon said they appreciate these arguments .
but they ca n't understand why the international airport has to be built near them .
they are now hoping to persuade the judges of the merits of their case in order to preserve what they see as an idyllic part of germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new berlin airport prepares for take-off after years of uncertainty , berlin has been given the green light to press ahead with the expansion of its schönefeld airport in the city 's east , but opposition to the project remains strong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2006 wto rules on transatlantic food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans hope the ruling helps them to just say no to gmos the world trade organization said tuesday that the eu and six member nations broke trading rules by imposing a moratorium on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops and foods in a landmark decision . on one side of the controversy is the eu , which has a long aversion to genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- and strict policies governing imports .
on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .
" we hope it does n't go that far , " the us trade official said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de discontent simmers over change in german farm policy a row over new agriculture minister horst seehofer 's plans to cut backing for ecological farming and pave the way for genetically modified crops continues in the christmas season .

the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .
one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .
most urgently , the palestinian problem must be solved . steffen leidel interviewed hans küng -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '
we ca n't achieve anything with violence anyway , " köhler said . " we have to see to it that we change something in our society when it comes to relations with each other , " he added . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .
one should try to learn who we are dealing with and what kind of goals this group has .
if you exclude negotiations from the beginning , you have a very poor starting position .
sooner or later , you 're going to have to talk with them . the spokesma n for the germa n foreig n mi n istry , marti n jäger , said the west was n ow wit n ess to a " difficult -lrb- period of -rrb- self-discovery i n the islamic world . "
do you thi n k this assessme n t is correct ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pakistani journalist with a placard during a protest outside the danish embassy in islamabad he is right .
islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .
take former iranian president khatami , for example .
he was involved in a dialogue in weimar with former -lrb- german -rrb- president johannes rau , prof. josef van ess and me .
but the bush administration included him in its " axis of evil " and said that khatami was no better than all the others .
and now one is surprised that a fanatic like ahmadinejad is in power in iran ? what do we n eed to quiet the curre n t situatio n i n the middle east ? above all , calm and reflection .
we need to look at the roots of this explosion of violence .

has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .

one should not give the radical groups an excuse to say : " you want to talk to us about violence and you yourself wage war in afghanistan , in iraq , in chechnya and in palestine . " how should the west deal with radical islamist groups , for example , hamas ?
despite its rece n t electoral triumph , the us a n d israel do n ' t wa n t to talk to the group . you ca n't demand democratic elections on the one hand and then complain when a group wins , which you did n't want to win .
it 's the same for iraq .
one should at least acknowledge -lrb- the victors -rrb- and should n't say from the outset : " we 're not talking with them . " should the west n egotiate with hamas ? the west can negotiate with hamas just like it eventually was able to negotiate with -lrb- yasser -rrb- arafat .
one should refrain from making negative statements at the very beginning and simply wait a while .

islam is engaged right now in a powerful process .
in many respect , islam is still following a medieval paradigm and must go through an islamic reformation and an islamic enlightenment at the same time .
the west is making a mistake when it comes to the islamic world shaking its index finger , setting conditions and telling muslims they need to finally enter the 21st century .
this is not helpful to muslims ; more cooperative efforts are necessary .
german policies , on the other hand , have been useful in bringing the dialogue forward .
at the same time , the bush administration has done much to let moderate islam down .

in an interview with dw-world , he called for reflection in both the western and islamic worlds . catholic theologia n a n d church critic ha n s kü n g has made a n ame for himself as a advocate of i n ter-religious dialogue a n d as the fou n der of the global ethic fou n datio n .

i n this co n text , there has bee n a lot of talk about samuel hu n ti n gto n 's co n cept of a " clash of civilizatio n s . "
has his theory bee n co n firmed ? hans küng : no , this thesis is , and will remain , incorrect .
cultures themselves do not wage war , but bad policy can make war a reality ; they bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy .
the west 's pursuit of policies that cause widespread anger in the muslim world has resulted in a dangerous escalation . do you mea n to say that the west is partly respo n sible for the viole n ce ? first , i want to say that i condemn this outbreak of violence and that i find the offensive remarks of iranian president ahmadinejad completely unacceptable .
but it is also crucial that the west reflect on the situation and accept that it has made many mistakes . such as ? instead of engaging in a police action in afghanistan , a war was waged there , which could have been avoided .
in iraq , a morally intolerable war is now going on in violation of international law .
we have the establishment of an oppressive regime in chechnya and the founding of a viable , contiguous palestinian state has been delayed for decades .
when that is all seen together , it should be no wonder that a huge amount of frustration , anger and rage has built up in the muslim world , which could explode at any time . the trigger of the curre n t viole n ce is the caricatures of the prophet mohammed .
did those who drew them go too far ? i do n't want to express blanket criticism of the media here .
there have been many very good commentaries on the topic , many of which have been very self-critical .
but i must point out that press freedom goes absolutely hand in hand with press responsibility .
for the interaction council of former heads of state and government , under the leadership of former german chancellor helmut schmidt , i worked on a statement outlining the duties of the press .
in paragraph 14 it states : " the freedom of the media brings with it a special responsibility for exact and truthful reporting .
sensationalist reports , which debase individuals or harm their dignity , must be unfailingly avoided . "
at the time , several press associations protested this statement .
today we know that it is crucial that along with press freedom , press responsibility has to be stressed . so the caricaturists did n ot behave respo n sibly ? they broke several taboos at once .
islam frowns on religious depictions of people and does not want to have the prophet depicted , in order to avoid any kind of idolatry .
now when the prophet is depicted in the form of a caricature accompanied by terrorist symbols and with modern weapons , the illustrator has gone too far .
if a person can be punished for libeling an individual or organization , or denying the holocaust , then it ca n't be the case that religious symbols can be abused at will .
that applies not only to the prophet mohammed , but also to jesus christ .
i have often been very annoyed at the flippant and shameless way jesus of nazareth has been treated .
that simply goes too far and some reflection is urgently needed . how much does the arabic world n eed to reflect ?
is there a willi n g n ess to e n gage i n a dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firebombs burn at the gate of the danish embassy in tehran reflection in the arabic world is urgently called for .
and basically , it is beginning to happen .
look at developments in turkey where in the last few years , much has changed for the positive .
however , the problem of violence - even that contained in the koran - is something the muslim world needs to address .
i have devoted many , many pages to this issue in my book about islam .
but that will only have the needed effect when the ambiguity of western policies comes to an end .

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .
the daily claims that the contest would reveal just how serious the west really is about the freedom of the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian protestors burn danish flags in front of the austrian embassy in tehran but erler said he believes that the iranian government is behind the holocaust competition , as it is clearly capitalizing on the current conflict for its own political purposes . he added that it 's not a surprise to find this attitude from the iranian leadership around president mahmoud ahmadinejad who himself denies israel 's right to statehood and claims the holocaust is an invention of zionism . bahman nirumand , an exiled iranian journalist living in germany , said that the intercultural conflict is playing into the hands of iranian fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's decision to resume nuclear research has disappeared from headlines in recent days " i think the iranian government is using every possible pretext to divert attention away from the problems it 's facing at present , " he said .
" there 's this huge row over the country 's nuclear program and tehran just ca n't get on top of it . " the intercultural conflict between the west and muslim countries is a welcome instrument to shift the focus away from internal problems , " he said . failure of dialogue ? the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said he 's shocked at the holocaust cartoon contest which in his view will exacerbate the current conflict in a frightening manner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of some of the six million victims of the holocaust hang on the walls at yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem he added that every attempt to belittle the horrors of the holocaust was simply heinous .
spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come . " what we see happening in certain countries is clearly and inflamed by certain groups who have an interest in sharpening the conflict of the west against islam , " she said . increased world cup security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a need for additional police presence at world cup games ?
against the background of heightened tensions between the western and muslim worlds , bavaria 's conservative interior minister , günther beckstein , has urged the government to revise its security concept for this year world soccer cup in germany . he called for certain travel restrictions with regard to potential visitors from muslim nations and iran in particular . beckstein said security officials had to look very carefully at who 'd be coming to germany , assuming that not everyone might be just a sports fanatic , but a radical fanatic of a political nature . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier over the conflict about mohammed cartoons published in europe .

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .
the daily claims that the contest would reveal just how serious the west really is about the freedom of the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian protestors burn danish flags in front of the austrian embassy in tehran but erler said he believes that the iranian government is behind the holocaust competition , as it is clearly capitalizing on the current conflict for its own political purposes . he added that it 's not a surprise to find this attitude from the iranian leadership around president mahmoud ahmadinejad who himself denies israel 's right to statehood and claims the holocaust is an invention of zionism . bahman nirumand , an exiled iranian journalist living in germany , said that the intercultural conflict is playing into the hands of iranian fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's decision to resume nuclear research has disappeared from headlines in recent days " i think the iranian government is using every possible pretext to divert attention away from the problems it 's facing at present , " he said .
" there 's this huge row over the country 's nuclear program and tehran just ca n't get on top of it . " the intercultural conflict between the west and muslim countries is a welcome instrument to shift the focus away from internal problems , " he said . failure of dialogue ? the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said he 's shocked at the holocaust cartoon contest which in his view will exacerbate the current conflict in a frightening manner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pictures of some of the six million victims of the holocaust hang on the walls at yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem he added that every attempt to belittle the horrors of the holocaust was simply heinous .
spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come . " what we see happening in certain countries is clearly and inflamed by certain groups who have an interest in sharpening the conflict of the west against islam , " she said . increased world cup security ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a need for additional police presence at world cup games ?
against the background of heightened tensions between the western and muslim worlds , bavaria 's conservative interior minister , günther beckstein , has urged the government to revise its security concept for this year world soccer cup in germany . he called for certain travel restrictions with regard to potential visitors from muslim nations and iran in particular . beckstein said security officials had to look very carefully at who 'd be coming to germany , assuming that not everyone might be just a sports fanatic , but a radical fanatic of a political nature . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier over the conflict about mohammed cartoons published in europe .

spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

the decision by iran 's biggest newspaper to start a contest for holocaust cartoons has been met with disbelief in germany .
policy-makers and political scientists speak of a despicable reaction to the mohammed cartoons . deputy foreign minister gernot erler said he 's gravely worried about the holocaust cartoon contest in the iranian newspaper hamshari .
the daily claims that the contest would reveal just how serious the west really is about the freedom of the press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian protestors burn danish flags in front of the austrian embassy in tehran but erler said he believes that the iranian government is behind the holocaust competition , as it is clearly capitalizing on the current conflict for its own political purposes . he added that it 's not a surprise to find this attitude from the iranian leadership around president mahmoud ahmadinejad who himself denies israel 's right to statehood and claims the holocaust is an invention of zionism . bahman nirumand , an exiled iranian journalist living in germany , said that the intercultural conflict is playing into the hands of iranian fundamentalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's decision to resume nuclear research has disappeared from headlines in recent days " i think the iranian government is using every possible pretext to divert attention away from the problems it 's facing at present , " he said .

spiegel added that the ongoing violent riots in the arab world just go to show that the political and inter-religious dialogue of the past few years has ended in complete failure . nevertheless , he urged all sides to return to more respectful ways of communication . but gudrun krämer , director of the institute for islamic studies at berlin 's freie university , said this will remain wishful thinking for quite some time to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2006 wto rules on transatlantic food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans hope the ruling helps them to just say no to gmos the world trade organization said tuesday that the eu and six member nations broke trading rules by imposing a moratorium on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops and foods in a landmark decision . on one side of the controversy is the eu , which has a long aversion to genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- and strict policies governing imports .
on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .
" we hope it does n't go that far , " the us trade official said . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de discontent simmers over change in german farm policy a row over new agriculture minister horst seehofer 's plans to cut backing for ecological farming and pave the way for genetically modified crops continues in the christmas season .

up to 700 demonstrators rampaged through the northern afghan city of maymana tuesday , throwing stones at a un office and a compound of a reconstruction project led by norwegian troops . mounting concern the united nations , european union and the organization for the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- have expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish embassy in syria was set afire by angry demonstrators " we are deeply alarmed at the repercussions of the publication in denmark several months ago of insulting caricatures of the prophet mohammed and their subsequent republication by some other european newspapers , and at the violent acts that have occurred in reaction to them , " representatives of the three organizations said in a joint statement . " we fully uphold the right of free speech .
but we understand the deep hurt and widespread indignation felt in the muslim world , " said the statement signed by un chief kofi annan , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and oic secretary general ekmeleddin ihsanoglu . " we believe freedom of the press entails responsibility and discretion and should respect the beliefs and tenets of all religions , " it added . the statement , however , also stressed that " the recent violent acts surpass the limits of peaceful protest , " and specifically condemned " the deplorable attacks on diplomatic missions that have occurred in damascus , beirut and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2006 wto rules on transatlantic food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans hope the ruling helps them to just say no to gmos the world trade organization said tuesday that the eu and six member nations broke trading rules by imposing a moratorium on genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- crops and foods in a landmark decision . on one side of the controversy is the eu , which has a long aversion to genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- and strict policies governing imports .
on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .
and decide they did .
in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .
the eu " has tied up most of these products without a scientific basis in a politically-motivated moratorium , " said a us trade official , who asked not to be named .
" we think we have a strong case . "
a distaste for gmos gmos have been widely used by more than 8 million farmers around the world for more than a decade , with more than half the crops being grown in the us , according to the office of the us trade representative in washington .
these include soy and corn that have been modified to better resist pests , survive drought or have a higher vitamin and mineral content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wto 's preliminary ruling is one of the longest and most complicated in its history proponents of gmos say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the us , have been growing and eating these crops for years - most processed foods in the us contain a gmo .
europeans have always been far more distrustful of gmos than their counterparts abroad calling them " franken foods . "
so despite an official eu policy allowing the imports , individual eu governments put restrictions on imported crops , such as corn , that have been genetically modified since 1998 , when it approved its last batch of gmos .
subsequently , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 70 percent of europeans oppose gmos as a result , the us , canada and argentina filed a complaint with the wto in 2003 accusing the eu of blocking approvals of new biotech varieties .
they said that violated trade treaties that mandated a quick approval process based on science .
as a result , the food industry was losing hundreds of millions in sales annually .
eu officials deny any moratorium .
they said that examining new products for safety takes time and that approval laws are fair .
and they point to the approval of sweet corn and other products since 2004 as proof that the process is working .
" the claim that there is a moratorium on approval of gm products in europe is not true , " said one eu trade official on the condition of anonymity before the ruling was released .
" we expect the ruling will note that . "
instead , the eu considers that major gmo producers such as the us should " adopt a co-operative approach to the development of a sound international legal framework for these products , instead of taking hostile steps at the wto , " according to an internal eu trade commission memo .
ruling will have symbolic effect the eu 's loss wo n't have a huge impact on sales , because demand for gmo products is still so low in europe that farmers and retailers are reluctant to gamble on offering them . opponents say that the ruling will even increase the aversion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american trade officials say that eu actions are violating trade agreements " opposition to genetically modified foods is likely to increase if the wto decides that european safeguards should be sacrificed to benefit biotech corporations , " adrian bebb , gmo campaigner for friends of the earth europe , said in a statement prior to the ruling .
" the wto , the us administration and biotech firms should stop their bullying and let europeans decide what food we eat . "
still , ruling in favor of the us-led complaint sends a signal for other countries to not take similar action .
meanwhile , eu could now ask for more time to comply or appeal the decision - or ignore it .
then compensatory fines and arbitration are likely .

on the other is the us , canada and argentina , who say such policies equal unfair trade barriers and are not backed up scientifically .
so it was up to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- to decide .

in a landmark case with sweeping repercussions , the wto on tuesday issued a preliminary decision on the issue , ruling that the eu - and germany , france , austria , luxembourg , italy and greece - essentially imposed a moratorium on gmos for six years beginning in 1998 .
such actions are forbidden under wto rules .
the long-awaited ruling , which was delivered confidentially to the parties involved and revealed by us and wto officials privately , is expected to take days to analyze - it is a complicated document consisting of a 1,000 pages that detail the trade histories of certain crops .
a final document is expected by the end of the year .
most observers had expected that the wto ruling would favor dismantling the eu 's strict policies and force the eu to accept more gmos .

14 . the engineering and metalworking sectors are among the most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . fears of " job exodus " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2004 , workers went on strike with demands of a 2 percent wage increase but with labor union ig metall demanding wage increases of 5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in industries ranging from cars to semi-conductors and employers not ruling out zero-wage increases , the negotiations this year could well lead to head-on confrontation . " we want to keep jobs in germany , " said the chief negotiator for the employers , heinrich fischer . " wage increases of 5 percent would lead to an exodus of jobs .

experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '
we ca n't achieve anything with violence anyway , " köhler said . " we have to see to it that we change something in our society when it comes to relations with each other , " he added . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : offsides from the fringe when baring it all is not enough world cup host city residents told to behave germany 's mascots play the shame game beate uhse loses its world cup buzz news -pipe- 08.02.2006 could goleo 's musical career spell the end for pille ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : the dynamic duo in one of their increasingly rare appearances together he first appeared without a voice ... or trousers ... but now , as his career takes another stratospheric upswing , goleo releases a solo hit single .
but what will happen to pille now the world cup lion has found his roar ? in terms of a recovery , it 's right up there with lazarus coming back from the dead . a year ago , we were marveling at the bravery of the german world cup mascot goleo as he stepped into the global limelight to become the world 's most famous mute . we mopped damp eyes as he bravely tried to communicate with growing numbers of adoring fans via his proxy spokesball pille .
we rejoiced in the scenes of the loveable lion cavorting around the stadiums of germany despite not being able to utter a single word .
he was an example to the legions of speechless carnivores who , until his arrival , had suffered in silence . now , however , we could be witness to a miracle .
not only can goleo now speak without the aid of his spherical sidekick , he can sing .
and not only can he sing but he is on the brink of claiming the number one slot in the germans singles chart with the song " love generation . " by appearing on the novelty record with dj bob sinclair and former bob marley collaborator gary pine , goleo has astounded medical experts who were convinced that the silent lion would never roar let alone sing .
for his fans , the mildly cheesy summer anthem - perfectly suited for the start of the world cup in june - is a celebration of goleo 's remarkable rebirth . goleo 's rise leaving pille deflated ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dfb head honcho gerhard mayer-vorfelder could have the inside track if a vacancy crops up but is there something more sinister at work ?
goleo watchers are perturbed that the furry idol appears alongside his musical team on his first hit record sans pille . goleo 's loyal ball , who announced the lion 's arrival on the global stage , may be on the cover of the single but his duties as vocalist seem to be surplus to requirements .
it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .
it could be the final act in what could turn out to be one of the most acrimonious splits in showbiz history ; one to rival george michael leaving wham or even the third break-up of modern talking . dw-world predicts a warts-and-all expose entitled " talking balls : pille 's story " in the shops by christmas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's mascots play the shame game is there a conspiracy in germany to sabotage the world cup ?

" when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .

in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety .

it could appear to some that now goleo has found his voice , pille has been kicked into touch . some have even suggested that goleo was not even mute in the first place and that the whole insane mouthing and mane shaking was the idea of a marketing team who also thought a talking ball would mean euros in the bank .
while such wild insinuations have little or no basis at this moment in time , one must wonder why goleo is now choosing to step out alone and to stretch his ' new ' vocal powers . the bitterest pille ? could it be that the trouser-less lion was always the one destined for greatness and that pille was just there as an attempt to double the merchandise takings ?
could it also be that the slightly scary talking sphere failed to find its way into the heart of the nation as goleo has so obviously done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talking ball wo n't be gagged this single signifies much more than goleo 's first assault on the top of the charts .

meanwhile , german companies have also been busy shopping overseas . they may have been the targets of acquisition by foreign buyers in recent years , but german companies are now increasingly looking to turn the tide . last year german shoemaker adidas bought rival sports shoe firm reebok for $ 3.8 billion -lrb- 3.2 billion euros -rrb- and deutsche post acquired british logistics firm exel for $ 5.5 billion . in addition , german chemicals giant basf is courting engelhard , an american catalyst-maker , with a $ 4.9 billion bid , and chemical company linde is eyeing british firm boc , for which it 's ready to shell out 11 billion euros . germany 's shopping spree in north america , in particular , has sparked a lot of attention . focusing on core business frank lutz , an investment banking expert at the deutsche bank , said the main reason german companies had been relatively uninvolved in mergers and acquisitions in the past was that they had instead focused too greatly on their core businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chemical giant basf in the bidding for us firm engelhard " that strengthened core business fields and the balance sheets , " said lutz , adding that several german companies had also disengaged themselves from sectors that did n't belong to their main business . " thus there was much more money at their disposal and the companies were once again able to make big purchases and strengthen their positions , " lutz explained .
" and it 's almost logical for european companies to look towards the biggest market of the world - the us . " us market more unrestricted thorsten widow of gavin anderson , a business consultancy , pointed out that companies in europe were often constrained at home by regulations governing takeovers and mergers . " for one , expansion plans in germany are very quickly subject to anti-trust legislation without the companies being able to pocket the strategic added profit they 're hoping for , " widow said . " secondly , mergers and takeovers are always linked to establishing market positions and to profit synergies .
and this is much easier to achieve in countries such as the us where potential buyers are still not represented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's dax-companies have money to burn for mergers and takeovers the 30 companies listed on germany 's dax share index alone have 120 billion euros in their coffers which they can spend on acquisitions .
that 's a third more than in 2002 . frank lutz of deutsche bank said that , in addition to strategic factors , other conditions work in companies ' favor . " the interest rate at the moment is still very favorable , interest is relatively low , " lutz said .
" the euro is very strong , the share markets are doing very well .
so there are a lot of possibilities to acquire the necessary capital .
and all these factors contribute to the fact that acquisitions and mergers have increased greatly . " us market more important for europeans though some european companies have managed to get a foothold in the surging asian market , lutz stressed that american companies simply had a different value for european bosses . " if a company today wants to grow via a fusion or a takeover , then there are very few or practically none in asia that would fit the bill , " said lutz . " in contrast , there are huge companies in the us , and here a firm can make tremendous progress with a transaction .

as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '
we ca n't achieve anything with violence anyway , " köhler said . " we have to see to it that we change something in our society when it comes to relations with each other , " he added . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '

experts however believe the zmd 's membership to be much smaller , between 20,000 to 30,000 muslims and predominantly of arab origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadeem elyas is a well-known figure in germany köhler 's election to the zmd has triggered widespread media interest in germany . for one , köhler is the first muslim of german origin to have made it to the top of the umbrella group .
as a muslim of german origin , köhler , who is a member of germany 's opposition free-market , liberal free democratic party , personifies a so-called european islam which is largely independent of the arab world . but he 's made it clear that he cares about the problems , integration deficits and also the discrimination perceived by muslims in germany . appoi n tme n t amid ragi n g co n troversy in addition , the election of the 67-year-old comes amid a simmering conflict over controversial cartoons of the prophet mohammed , first published in a danish paper , and which is considered blasphemous by muslims . shortly after his appointment this week , one of the first questions köhler faced during a television interview was how he felt about the mohammed caricatures as a muslim . " first of all , we condemn these detestable portrayals , " he said .
" they violate the dignity of muslims .
religion is part of human dignity - and that 's a really intimate sphere that one should not violate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim protests against the caricatures have turned violent in several countries at the same köhler said he criticized the violent protests by muslims in several arab countries which have included setting danish and norwegian embassies alight , burning european flags and issuing death threats to the caricaturists who originally created the mohammed cartoons . " when i see the images -lrb- from muslim countries -rrb- where an incensed and thoughtless mob charges through the streets and sets house on fire and now even damages churches , then there 's outrage here in germany about the sudden outbreak of anger and hatred , " köhler said .
" we abhor such actions and we 're trying everything to de-escalate this tense situation . " cou n teri n g ge n eralizatio n s born in the city of stettin in current-day poland , köhler later fled to then communist east germany with his family . in 1956 , the köhlers moved to what was then west germany and köhler finally landed in the southern german city of freiburg as a geology student . that 's where he first came into contact with students of muslim faith .
in 1963 , köhler converted to islam .
in interviews with german media , köhler justified his decision by underlining the " brotherliness and empathy " of his fellow muslim students as well as the realization that he had found a " really enlightened religion " in islam in which " sense and knowledge was one of the fundaments of piety . " köhler said he is well aware that since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the image of islam in germany and other western countries has been one of a religion that tends to drift towards violence and fundamentalism . he has underlined that he plans to strongly counter such generalizations , which have once again arisen in the current raging crisis over the mohammed caricatures , during his term as chairman at the zmd . cari n g about i n tegratio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of germany 's muslims come from turkey at the same time , köhler has appealed to the more than three million muslims in germany not to be swayed by the violent demonstrations over the controversial cartoons , but rather to register their protests peacefully . " we can do that here in germany by appealing to the muslims : ' please do n't let yourself be provoked ! '
we ca n't achieve anything with violence anyway , " köhler said . " we have to see to it that we change something in our society when it comes to relations with each other , " he added . rainer sollich -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : europe no stranger to blasphemy violent muslim protests over cartoons published in european papers have left the continent reeling .

in an icm poll , only 22 % of people said they wanted the assembly government to take over direct funding of the arts .
some 56 % wanted the arts council of wales -lrb- acw -rrb- to continue funding and developing the arts .
the survey followed a defeat for labour , which had tried to take over responsibility for arts funding .
culture minister alun pugh had announced plans to take control of funding for welsh national opera , bbc national orchestra of wales , diversions dance group , clwyd theatr cymru , academy and the national theatre of wales away from the acw .
his proposal followed the 2004 announcement that the assembly government would take over many of the duties of a number of wales ' unelected culture , sport and countryside bodies - or quangos - including the acw .
alun pugh planned to adopt direct control of funding of six arts bodies but opposition parties and two independent ams united to defeat labour and passed an amendment instructing the assembly government to hold a public review of the funding of arts groups .
the new poll suggests that the majority of people agree with the principle of " arm 's-length " funding of the arts .
it also suggests that people from middle-class backgrounds are more likely to visit arts events than those from working-class backgrounds .
a total of 80 % of those polled said that they had been to at least one arts-based event in their lifetime .
but of that figure , 56 % had not been to a single arts event in the last year and just 4 % said they went 10 times or more in the past year .
theatre was the most popular arts activity , followed by art galleries and craft fairs .
a total of 40 % thought arts events were overpriced , while 30 % believed the cost was fair .
the welsh assembly government has never proposed directly funding the entire arts sector , only our six national companies alun pugh , culture minister only one in seven of those asked were aware of the arts funding issue , although among those with high attendance records , that figure rose to 24 % .
in reaction to the findings , mr pugh said : " the figures in the icm poll make interesting reading and it is an useful addition to our evidence base .
" it is interesting to read that there is substantial disquiet concerning fairness of funding in different areas of wales .
" i would like to restate that we have no plans to abolish the arts council for wales , and expert advice from the arts sector will inform government policy .
" the welsh assembly government has never proposed directly funding the entire arts sector , only our six national companies . "
changing culture - the future of the arts in wales is screened on bbc 1 wales on wednesday at 2240 gmt .

a senior indian official made the announcement late on tuesday night after talks with representatives of the united liberation front of assam .
the talks were aimed at ending a nearly 27-year-old insurgency .
more than 10,000 people have died in the rebel group 's fight for a separate assamese homeland .
the united liberation front of assam -lrb- ulfa -rrb- was represented by an 11-member group comprising of journalists , human rights activists and lawyers .
we are happy with the outcome of the talks arup borbora ulfa representative federal home secretary vk duggal told journalists that the government had agreed to initiate a series of " confidence-building measures " including releasing the detainees and examine complaints of human rights violations .
" both sides have agreed that maintenance of a peaceful atmosphere in the state to create a conducive environment for a dialogue is a prerequisite , " he said .
india 's national security advisor , mk narayanan , was also present at the talks .
another round of talks between the two groups is planned before direct talks with the rebels .
" we are happy with the outcome of the talks .
we are also happy that a consensus has emerged , " a spokesman of the representative group , arup borbora , is quoted as saying by reuters .
" our efforts would be to bring ulfa to the negotiating table . "
violence peace moves between the federal government and ulfa had looked shaky after the rebels carried out a series of attacks last month , blowing up oil pipelines and targeting police and security personnel .
two policemen were killed and more than 30 people injured in the attacks which came ahead of india 's republic day celebrations .
ulfa is one of the most powerful of nearly a dozen separatist groups fighting indian security forces in the north-east .
most rebel groups in assam , including the national democratic front of bodoland -lrb- ndfb -rrb- have started negotiations with delhi .
several ulfa leaders held talks with the indian government in 1992 , but the talks failed to yield results .

the forest is home to a rare white bear species and is the ancestral land of several indigenous canadian tribes .
the deal will save a vast area of forest for wildlife , while allowing sustainable logging in other parts .
the settlement between tribes , loggers and environmentalists is being hailed as an example for other countries .
the land covered by the great bear rainforest is huge .
at 64,000 sq-km -lrb- 25,000 sq-mile -rrb- , it is about twice the size of belgium .
it stretches 400km -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- up the pacific coast from vancouver island all the way north to alaska .
past clashes it has seen frequent disputes in recent years between the lumber industry and environmental groups .
under the new agreement , about a third of the land is being preserved completely to protect wildlife in the region , including the kermode bear - a sub-species of black bear with white fur , found only in this region - wolves , grizzly bears and wild salmon .
the rest of the region will see some logging and mining but even environmental groups say they are satisfied the companies will use sustainable practices that will be a model for the rest of the world .
local aboriginal groups have given their backing to the agreement .
they have been fighting for a much greater say in land use around their traditional territories for decades .
provincial premier gordon campbell , announcing the agreement alongside native indian drummers , said : " the result is a strong marriage that balances the needs of the environment with the need for sustainable jobs and a strong economic future for coastal communities . "
the bbc 's ian gunn in vancouver says this is all a far cry from just a few years ago , when environmental groups and the logging industry clashed in the same forests with blockades and frequent arrests .
now both sides say they have an agreement that should settle the matter for good .

the sound was cut when frontman mick jagger sang lyrics that were deemed inappropriate for tv audiences .
national football league officials said the band agreed to have the songs censored before sunday 's show .
but the rolling stones said the decision by nfl and tv network abc was " completely unnecessary " .
abc said changes to the stones ' show were made by the nfl and its producers , while nfl spokesman brian mccarthy said the band was " aware of it and were fine " with the cuts .
huge audience during the stones ' 12 minute set , lyrics in start me up and rough justice were cut , while -lrb- i ca n't get no -rrb- satisfaction was left intact .
the super bowl , which was held in detroit on sunday , attracted its biggest audience in a decade , with more than 90 million viewers .
it also rated as the most-watched television programme in the us since 1996 .
comedy-drama grey 's anatomy , which was aired on the abc network after the game , pulled in the biggest audience for an entertainment programme since the finale of friends two years ago .
it was also abc 's highest-rating entertainment show for 12 years .
at 2004 's super bowl , janet jackson caused outrage in the us when a " wardrobe malfunction " exposed her right breast during a routine with justin timberlake .
the incident , which was broadcast to millions of tv viewers worldwide , led to the cbs tv network being fined a record $ 550,000 -lrb- £ 292,000 -rrb- .
this year , tv network abc broadcast the super bowl with a five-second delay while a sell-out 65,000 crowd watched the rolling stones live .
music stars who have performed at the super bowl in the past have included sir paul mccartney and u2 .

mother-of-two jayne sullivan , 45 , is to resume her demo at the new assembly building , the senedd , on wednesday .
she has called for a meeting with health minister dr brian gibbons to ask for an assurance that every patient who needs the drug will have it .
on tuesday , ams voted to speed up the process of approving new drugs .
the governing labour group backed a liberal democrat motion on speeding up the approval of new drugs on the nhs .
health minister brian gibbons told ams he " expected " local health boards all over wales to approve the drug .
with regard to herceptin , it is now readily available in the north and the south -lrb- of wales -rrb- , but there are two authorities in the west still holding out jayne sullivan it means women with breast cancer could have the drug - only available in the late stages of the disease - earlier in their treatment .
some local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- will fund the drug despite the fact it will not be licensed in the uk to treat early stage breast cancer until march .
ms sullivan spent her first night at home on tuesday following a seven-day protest in the foyer of the former assembly building , crickhowell house .
during that time she repeatedly refused a private meeting with dr gibbons unless it was in public , but has now changed her mind , on the condition she can bring some of her supporters with her .
she told bbc wales on wednesday : " there was an awful lot woolly political-speak yesterday in the assembly but , what i can see of it as a layman , the assembly admitted that there was a postcode lottery .
" with regard to herceptin , it is now readily available in the north and the south , but there are two authorities in the west still holding out . "
it is still not resolved if the 22 local health boards in wales will automatically prescribe herceptin to women in the early stages of breast cancer .
at present , the 10 local health boards in south east wales - including ms sullivan 's own in cardiff - have said patients who meet the criteria can have the drug .
a further eight say it will be available , but on a case-by-case basis .
the remaining four health boards in mid and west wales say they are reviewing their position .
' postcode lottery ' earlier in the day , ms sullivan led a march of more than 100 people to move her protest to the senedd but said she will now only continue it during the day .
she said : " my own health started to deteriorate and that was purely due to the air conditioning and i have to remain strong for the ladies in the west .
" i thought by coming home during the night i could return to the assembly today and be just as forthright as i have been over the last week . "
she said she wanted dr gibbons to say " in terms that i can understand and the people of wales can understand that there is a post code lottery , that north and south are now providing this drug and it 's not available in the west " .
" in this situation , and it 's very specific , a woman like myself , her back is against the wall , " she said .
" there are no other options to prevent this cancer returning .
you are not prescribed any other medicine .
so , of course , something that will give you that extra percentage , a woman like myself wants . "

" a bottle of red , a bottle of white / perhaps a bottle of ginger ale tonight . "
that 's how joel sang the opening line from his hit song scenes from an italian restaurant the other night at madison square garden .
suddenly the 56-year-old piano man is on a roll , his career magically rejuvenated .
the concert marked the beginning of an historic run of 12 concerts at new york city 's famous arena , breaking the record of 10 set by bruce springsteen in 2000 .
and so he had the confidence to tweak the lyrics to one of his most famous songs to poke fun at his new-found sobriety , following several years of alcohol addiction that kept him in and out of the gossip pages and out of the musical limelight .
he 's one of the few musicians to write about the people whose lives are n't considered very interesting : white middle class people debbie geller , biographer of billy joel it is a welcome return to form for the talented singer and pianist .
but this renewed success has surprised many people .
" the industry always seems surprised at billy 's success , and i 'm surprised when they 're surprised , " says joel 's longtime agent , dennis arfa .
" billy 's one of these great icons , up there with springsteen , buffett , u2 , the rolling stones and elton john .
there 's a group and he 's one of them . "
contribution the truth is , many music critics have never really liked joel , and they do n't include him in the pantheon of great artists .
serious rock writers have tended to consider him a " balladeer " with little of importance to say .
billy joel was a hit with the public but not with music critics joel never received much critical praise for his most famous songs , piano man , just the way you are and uptown girl , to name but a few of his many hits .
he has long resented the critical black hole he 's been placed in , famously ripping up negative reviews on stage to show his anger .
but the question remains : what is his contribution to music ?
" if anything , he 's the voice of the suburbs .
he 's one of the few musicians to write about the people whose lives are n't considered very interesting : white middle class people , " says debbie geller , the author of billy joel : an illustrated biography .
there are characters like brenda and eddie , for example , from his narrative song , scenes from an italian restaurant , who get married and buy " a couple of paintings from sears , " not to mention the big water bed that they " bought with the bread / they had saved for a couple of years " .
beloved joel has sold upwards of 78 million albums worldwide , although his last album of new material , river of dreams , was released in 1993 .
in 2002 he teamed up with choreographer twyla tharp to create a broadway musical called movin ' out .
the show was a box-office hit , won two tony awards and garnered widespread critical acclaim .
but that has n't impressed the critics .
one recent piece of bad press argued that joel was born at the wrong time .
" joel came of age in the post-beatles era , when songwriters grew self-conscious about rock 's aesthetic and social significance , and felt compelled to make statements .
" alas , joel is a leaden lyricist with nothing to say , " wrote jody rosen , the music critic for the online magazine , slate .
obviously none of this matters to the crowds who are flocking to see the multi-platinum pop star .
joel has always been a beloved figure in the new york area since he was born and raised in hicksville - a prototype american suburb on long island .
and even during the worst moments of his drinking crisis , joel redeemed his offstage antics with a performance that cemented his status as a new york hero .
the poignant moment came during a telethon concert just after 9/11 when joel sang new york state of mind with a fallen fireman 's helmet on his grand piano .
he has recently released a retrospective boxed set called my lives - a career spanning collection of music .
the musician says he stopped writing pop music back in 1993 .
but that , he insists , does n't mean he 's retired from performing .
and his record-breaking series at madison square garden might begin the second , or third chapter in joel 's unpredictable career .

" a bottle of red , a bottle of white / perhaps a bottle of ginger ale tonight . "
that 's how joel sang the opening line from his hit song scenes from an italian restaurant the other night at madison square garden .
suddenly the 56-year-old piano man is on a roll , his career magically rejuvenated .
the concert marked the beginning of an historic run of 12 concerts at new york city 's famous arena , breaking the record of 10 set by bruce springsteen in 2000 .
and so he had the confidence to tweak the lyrics to one of his most famous songs to poke fun at his new-found sobriety , following several years of alcohol addiction that kept him in and out of the gossip pages and out of the musical limelight .
he 's one of the few musicians to write about the people whose lives are n't considered very interesting : white middle class people debbie geller , biographer of billy joel it is a welcome return to form for the talented singer and pianist .
but this renewed success has surprised many people .
" the industry always seems surprised at billy 's success , and i 'm surprised when they 're surprised , " says joel 's longtime agent , dennis arfa .
" billy 's one of these great icons , up there with springsteen , buffett , u2 , the rolling stones and elton john .
there 's a group and he 's one of them . "
contribution the truth is , many music critics have never really liked joel , and they do n't include him in the pantheon of great artists .
serious rock writers have tended to consider him a " balladeer " with little of importance to say .
billy joel was a hit with the public but not with music critics joel never received much critical praise for his most famous songs , piano man , just the way you are and uptown girl , to name but a few of his many hits .
he has long resented the critical black hole he 's been placed in , famously ripping up negative reviews on stage to show his anger .
but the question remains : what is his contribution to music ?
" if anything , he 's the voice of the suburbs .
he 's one of the few musicians to write about the people whose lives are n't considered very interesting : white middle class people , " says debbie geller , the author of billy joel : an illustrated biography .
there are characters like brenda and eddie , for example , from his narrative song , scenes from an italian restaurant , who get married and buy " a couple of paintings from sears , " not to mention the big water bed that they " bought with the bread / they had saved for a couple of years " .
beloved joel has sold upwards of 78 million albums worldwide , although his last album of new material , river of dreams , was released in 1993 .
in 2002 he teamed up with choreographer twyla tharp to create a broadway musical called movin ' out .
the show was a box-office hit , won two tony awards and garnered widespread critical acclaim .
but that has n't impressed the critics .
one recent piece of bad press argued that joel was born at the wrong time .
" joel came of age in the post-beatles era , when songwriters grew self-conscious about rock 's aesthetic and social significance , and felt compelled to make statements .
" alas , joel is a leaden lyricist with nothing to say , " wrote jody rosen , the music critic for the online magazine , slate .
obviously none of this matters to the crowds who are flocking to see the multi-platinum pop star .
joel has always been a beloved figure in the new york area since he was born and raised in hicksville - a prototype american suburb on long island .
and even during the worst moments of his drinking crisis , joel redeemed his offstage antics with a performance that cemented his status as a new york hero .

jointly hosted by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- and the italian government , the meeting marked a turning point in the digital content debate , as several long-simmering concerns emerged as mainstream issues .
the discussion pointed to two competing approaches for the creation and distribution of digital content in the internet era .
one approach , advocated by conventional content companies from the movie and music industries , as well as by us government officials , emphasised the need for digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- technologies to " lock down " content .
they argued that drm allows them to set specific limitations on the use of content , thereby facilitating commercial models such as individual downloads or full subscription services .
drm supporters assured delegates that their models were gaining marketplace acceptance as the content owners claimed that they stand ready to license their material for distribution on multiple platforms such as the internet and mobile phones .
user-generated future while the emphasis on drm was not unexpected , the alternate approach , which focused on user-generated content , took many delegates by surprise .
described as " amateur " content , the conference featured numerous presentations on how the combination of easy-to-use technologies and widespread internet access has unleashed an unprecedented array of new creativity .
rather than reducing their reliance on digital rights management , content owners blamed electronics makers for a lack of interoperability these included discussions on creative commons , an alternate licensing system that has enabled individuals to make more than 60 million works available to the internet community ; flickr , the photo-sharing site that features millions of digital photographs ; and the bbc creative archive , which allows uk residents to re-use original content from that country 's public broadcaster .
the popularity of weblogs , or blogs , also attracted considerable interest .
david sifry , the founder and ceo of technorati , a blog search engine , reported that his company now tracks more than 27 million blogs , with 75,000 new blogs created every day .
moreover , the popularity of blogs is not strictly a north american phenomenon .
last month technorati tracked more blog postings written in japanese than in english .
passing the blame notwithstanding the support for the drm and user-generated approaches , both face threats that could hamper their development .
digital rights restrict the numbers of times users can copy music drm supporters seemed ready to acknowledge that the technology has created consumer concerns .
although there was still little discussion of the privacy and security problems that were typified by last year 's sony rootkit controversy , many speakers admitted that major problems have arisen from the lack of interoperability that has made it difficult for consumers to transfer lawfully acquired content from one device to another .
for example , the napster music subscription service has been hurt by the inability to transfer songs to an apple ipod .
rather than addressing the problem by reducing their reliance on drm , however , the content owners lay the blame for the lack of interoperability on consumer electronics makers .
this was characterised as " content neutrality " , with the drm backers looking to legislators to require the electronics makers to reconfigure their devices to allow the locked content to work on all devices .
a two-tier internet ?
while the content owners battle the electronics makers over drm solutions that may still leave consumers paying more for less , the growth of user-generated content faces two threats .
one threat comes from the limitations of drm-enabled content , which can severely limit or prohibit legal modification of material .
these concerns were raised last week at a uk parliamentary committee hearing on drm by well-respected organisations such as the british library .
other forms of user-generated content are increasing user-generated content also faces the threat of the two-tiered internet , which has garnered increasing attention in recent months .
this refers to internet service provider -lrb- isp -rrb- plans to restrict subscriber access to software such as bittorrent , which is widely used to distribute user-generated content such as independent films or open source programs .
the two-tier internet could also hamper the growth of tools used to locate user-generated content , since isps such as bellsouth , verizon , and telus have all raised the prospect of charging websites and services for the right to deliver content to their subscribers .
while established websites may pay such tolls , many smaller sites could be forced out of business by these isp demands .
in light of these developments , the conference ultimately sent a mixed message about the future of the digital economy .
the internet has sparked a remarkable outpouring of new creativity and provided conventional content owners with exciting new marketplace opportunities .
yet legislators may be forced to intervene to ensure that consumers are protected from onerous drm restrictions and that isps are precluded from using their positions as internet gatekeepers to harm innovation .
