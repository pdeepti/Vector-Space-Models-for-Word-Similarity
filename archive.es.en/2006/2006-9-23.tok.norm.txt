documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .
the 31.5-kilometer test track has been in operation since 1984 . german chancellor angela merkel traveled to the crash scene on friday .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee arrived saturday at the crash scene from china where he had discussed a maglev sale and other issues . tiefensee has scheduled a meeting with the train developers on sunday to discuss the ramifications of the crash and figure out whether it will have consequences for transrapid 's future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transrapid train crash claims 23 lives in germany german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of a german high-speed train crash on a test route in emsland where 23 people died when the transrapid train hit a maintenance vehicle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.09.2006 bayern munich 's manager envisions ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trophies like these may happen only if bayern go public european soccer knows practically no limits when it comes to money .
in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .
the team announced this week that its membership roll surpassed the 120,000 mark , making it according to club officials , the second-largest club by member numbers behind last year 's champions league victors fc barcelona . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .

the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .

representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it .

she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .

" marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers .

the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .

" when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it .

in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .

then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 23.09.2006 will the vatican 's secret archives shed light on pius xii ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pius xii was pope from 1939 to 1958 critics accuse pope pius xii of keeping quiet about the holocaust .
documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .
the team announced this week that its membership roll surpassed the 120,000 mark , making it according to club officials , the second-largest club by member numbers behind last year 's champions league victors fc barcelona . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .
the 31.5-kilometer test track has been in operation since 1984 . german chancellor angela merkel traveled to the crash scene on friday .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee arrived saturday at the crash scene from china where he had discussed a maglev sale and other issues . tiefensee has scheduled a meeting with the train developers on sunday to discuss the ramifications of the crash and figure out whether it will have consequences for transrapid 's future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transrapid train crash claims 23 lives in germany german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of a german high-speed train crash on a test route in emsland where 23 people died when the transrapid train hit a maintenance vehicle .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .

from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .

but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.09.2006 medical tourism growth industry in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hospitals - the envy of many it might be the country 's own favorite bugbear , but german health care enjoys an excellent reputation abroad , both in terms of quality and cost .
medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .

" when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 23.09.2006 medical tourism growth industry in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hospitals - the envy of many it might be the country 's own favorite bugbear , but german health care enjoys an excellent reputation abroad , both in terms of quality and cost .
medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .
before sept .
11 , the most common destination was the us , but heightened security now makes it less likely they will be granted visas and germany has proved to be an efficient alternative . experts say up to 10,000 arab patients are treated in germany every year , and they do n't just top up hospital coffers .
they often bring their families with them and frequently take the opportunity for a full-blown vacation , spending generously on accommodation , shopping and sight-seeing in the process . " arab states will be sending patients abroad for at least another 10 years , " steller said , adding that germany should wake up and smell the coffee - and maximize these visitors ' consumer potential . " it 's all just a question of organization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .

medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .
before sept .
11 , the most common destination was the us , but heightened security now makes it less likely they will be granted visas and germany has proved to be an efficient alternative . experts say up to 10,000 arab patients are treated in germany every year , and they do n't just top up hospital coffers .
they often bring their families with them and frequently take the opportunity for a full-blown vacation , spending generously on accommodation , shopping and sight-seeing in the process . " arab states will be sending patients abroad for at least another 10 years , " steller said , adding that germany should wake up and smell the coffee - and maximize these visitors ' consumer potential . " it 's all just a question of organization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .

from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .

but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .

the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .

then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .

you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .

medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .
before sept .
11 , the most common destination was the us , but heightened security now makes it less likely they will be granted visas and germany has proved to be an efficient alternative . experts say up to 10,000 arab patients are treated in germany every year , and they do n't just top up hospital coffers .
they often bring their families with them and frequently take the opportunity for a full-blown vacation , spending generously on accommodation , shopping and sight-seeing in the process . " arab states will be sending patients abroad for at least another 10 years , " steller said , adding that germany should wake up and smell the coffee - and maximize these visitors ' consumer potential . " it 's all just a question of organization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .
but international comparisons and health-care experts paint a different picture .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .
the 31.5-kilometer test track has been in operation since 1984 . german chancellor angela merkel traveled to the crash scene on friday .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee arrived saturday at the crash scene from china where he had discussed a maglev sale and other issues . tiefensee has scheduled a meeting with the train developers on sunday to discuss the ramifications of the crash and figure out whether it will have consequences for transrapid 's future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transrapid train crash claims 23 lives in germany german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of a german high-speed train crash on a test route in emsland where 23 people died when the transrapid train hit a maintenance vehicle .

in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .

in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers .

the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .

representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .
the 31.5-kilometer test track has been in operation since 1984 . german chancellor angela merkel traveled to the crash scene on friday .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee arrived saturday at the crash scene from china where he had discussed a maglev sale and other issues . tiefensee has scheduled a meeting with the train developers on sunday to discuss the ramifications of the crash and figure out whether it will have consequences for transrapid 's future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transrapid train crash claims 23 lives in germany german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of a german high-speed train crash on a test route in emsland where 23 people died when the transrapid train hit a maintenance vehicle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 23.09.2006 europe mulls standard way to deal with prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prostitution is legal in germany , but it 's still got a bad reputation , many say the council of europe is looking for ways to standardize laws on prostitution on the continent .
but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .

documents soon to be released from the secret archives may provide insight on the vatican behind the scenes , said church historian hubert wolf . dw-world.de : the vatica n 's secret archive is maki n g docume n ts from 1922 to 1939 available to the public for the first time .
what n ew i n sights are you hopi n g for ? hubert wolf : for the first time , we will have a look into the curia 's internal discussions and reports by 80 nunciatures -lrb- note : diplomatic representatives of the vatican -rrb- from around the world .
from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.09.2006 bayern munich 's manager envisions ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trophies like these may happen only if bayern go public european soccer knows practically no limits when it comes to money .
in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .
the team announced this week that its membership roll surpassed the 120,000 mark , making it according to club officials , the second-largest club by member numbers behind last year 's champions league victors fc barcelona . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .

in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .
the team announced this week that its membership roll surpassed the 120,000 mark , making it according to club officials , the second-largest club by member numbers behind last year 's champions league victors fc barcelona . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .

medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .
before sept .
11 , the most common destination was the us , but heightened security now makes it less likely they will be granted visas and germany has proved to be an efficient alternative . experts say up to 10,000 arab patients are treated in germany every year , and they do n't just top up hospital coffers .
they often bring their families with them and frequently take the opportunity for a full-blown vacation , spending generously on accommodation , shopping and sight-seeing in the process . " arab states will be sending patients abroad for at least another 10 years , " steller said , adding that germany should wake up and smell the coffee - and maximize these visitors ' consumer potential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 23.09.2006 europe mulls standard way to deal with prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prostitution is legal in germany , but it 's still got a bad reputation , many say the council of europe is looking for ways to standardize laws on prostitution on the continent .
but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .

then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

medical tourism is booming - and germany could be making more of it . within germany , the health care system is like a nagging back-ache that wo n't go away .
everyone complains , but no one ever does anything about it . but in fact , everyone else seems to think that german health care is blooming - and more and more patients are coming here from abroad for a piece of the pie . according to axel steller , the ceo of the arab german health foundation , 50,000 foreign patients sought treatment in germany in 2001 , staying an average 10 days , spending approximately 250 euros -lrb- $ 317 -rrb- per day and generating a total turnover of 125 million euros . the relationship is a mutually beneficial one insofar as clinics are not required to factor treatment of foreign patients into their annual budget .
it 's a win-win situation for all concerned , and makes these profitable patients from abroad a coveted clientele to local hospitals . why does it happe n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germany 's foreign patients end up in a local hospital willingly but before germany starts patting itself on the back , it should take a closer look at why these patients come .
it 's not always just because germany is such an attractive prospect . the bulk of foreign patients end up in german hospitals for the banal reason that they 're in the country on holiday or business and fall unexpectedly ill .
others , however , are fleeing long waiting lists such as those in britain , while many come either from neighboring countries or places where medical care is too costly - as in the us . " in the us , operations are four to five times are expensive as they are in germany , " steller said .
us insurance companies will therefore take over the entire costs of a trip to a german clinic , while other patients head to the continent because they ca n't afford treatment back home . " a questio n of orga n izatio n " it 's an altogether different story in russia - where up to 15 million people can theoretically afford treatment but simply ca n't get it .
medical services are in such a state of disrepair , that those with the financial means prefer to make the trip to germany . the gulf states , meanwhile , tend to buy state-of-the-art equipment but lack trained professionals .
well-heeled patients can expect to be flown overseas .
before sept .
11 , the most common destination was the us , but heightened security now makes it less likely they will be granted visas and germany has proved to be an efficient alternative . experts say up to 10,000 arab patients are treated in germany every year , and they do n't just top up hospital coffers .
they often bring their families with them and frequently take the opportunity for a full-blown vacation , spending generously on accommodation , shopping and sight-seeing in the process . " arab states will be sending patients abroad for at least another 10 years , " steller said , adding that germany should wake up and smell the coffee - and maximize these visitors ' consumer potential . " it 's all just a question of organization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german health system not quite in intensive care going by media reports and public opinion in germany , one might think the country 's health care system is sclerotic and near collapse .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .

on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .

in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .

bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 23.09.2006 europe mulls standard way to deal with prostitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prostitution is legal in germany , but it 's still got a bad reputation , many say the council of europe is looking for ways to standardize laws on prostitution on the continent .
but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .

for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?

what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries .

but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .

the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .

then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .

from that we will be able to see what stance the church took on issues that were significant at that time .
for example , what was its relationship to fascism ?
or to franco in spain ?
what position did the church take on the topic of violence ?
what was its relationship to national socialism and what was the curia 's opinion on anti-semitism up until 1939 ? not only do we have the pope 's official statements , but now we also have the internal discussions from the dicasteria - the vatican 's " ministries . " they reveal that very different positions on individual issues were represented in the curia and that there was definitely conflict and difference of opinion there . si n ce october , a jewish-catholic historical commissio n has bee n exami n i n g of the questio n of to what exte n t the church k n ew about the mass murder of the jews a n d what its positio n o n the " fi n al solutio n " was .
will there be a n swers to these questio n s ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubert wolf has been recognized for communicating church history to the public the files from pius xii 's papacy have not been released yet .
but i 'm fairly certain that the vatican will make them available in the next few years so that the jewish-catholic historical commission 's question can be answered .
then there would be an end to speculations . i think that opening of the inquisition archives in 1998 , the early opening in 2003 of the files on german issues in the vatican archives and now the complete opening of pius xi 's papacy from 1992 to 1939 are all steps that belong to the major confession of guilt that the pope made in 2000 for the mistakes that the church had made .
he asked the historians to clear these things up . numerous questio n s o n the relatio n ship betwee n the catholic church a n d the co n flicti n g political ideologies of the 20th ce n tury remai n ope n .
what was the curia 's relatio n ship to spai n u n der fra n co a n d a n ti-clericalism i n mexico ? the topics of mexico and the anti-clerical position of the mexican government were slow-burners , as we 've seen .
the congregation had a lot of meetings for extra church issues , that is , from the political centers of the state office . in the 1920s , mexico was discussed many times , including the question of how to deal with violence and prosecution .
could there have been a catholic counter-force ?
this shows that mexico was in no way on the sidelines but played a central role in rome in the 1920s .
more central , in any case , than people thought from their narrow , eurocentric perspective . the files o n pius xii 's papacy have n ' t bee n released yet .
before that , however , he had bee n a n u n cio i n germa n y a n d the cardi n al 's state secretary i n the vatica n u n der his civil n ame euge n pacelli .
do you expect to lear n more about his positio n o n the holocaust , which is still u n clear ? once the documents are made accessible , it makes sense to wait until historians have assessed the documents on pacelli in his role as nuncio in germany and cardinal 's state secretary to pius xi .
then the speculations will finally stop .
then you will be able to say exactly what the cardinal 's state secretary pacelli thought about each topic , like spain under franco , and compare his position to that of the pope or the other cardinals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in june pope benedict xvi authorized the opening lf the pius xii files could the beatificatio n process pla n n ed for pius xii be put o n hold due to the expected revelatio n s ? only the pope himself can decide if the beatification process will be put on hold .
i think that after the sources on pacelli have really been examined then the historical aspects of such a beatification process can be considered on a secure foundation - not based on speculation or criticism but on hard facts .
you can be sure that the 3,500 reports we have from pacelli will bring us closer to him as a person , minister , or politician . i think that these german influences make it easier to understand how he acted later on as pope .
that 's why we 're not disappointed that we do n't have the files from 1939 to 1945 yet .
if i 'd read the 3,500 nuncio reports from pacelli already , i would presumable have a more nuanced impression of eugenio pacelli , who later became pope pius xii . hubert wolf is professor of church history at the u n iversity of mü n ster a n d is a leadi n g expert o n the vatica n secret archives . eva usi interviewed hubert wolf -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's apology fails to stem anger of muslim hardliners pope benedict xvi 's personal apology for hurting the feelings of muslims with a controversial speech failed to stem the anger of hardliners despite calls for calm from islamic and western leaders .

christian wulff , premier of the german state of lower saxony where the crash occurred , said the collision could not have happened on commercial magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- lines , because these would always have automated safety systems . " if anything were on the track , a commercially operated train would be automatically halted , " wulff told reporters .
" this safety feature was not installed on the test line . " he added he believed the overall maglev technology was a safe one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff at the scene of the accident on friday " in this case we assume there was human error and a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances , " he said .
" the accident could not have happened on the world 's only commercial maglev track , between shanghai city and shanghai airport . " despite this accident , i am still expecting our chinese partners to extend that track , " wulff said . the current track in china is 30 kilometers -lrb- 18.6 miles -rrb- long . germany hopes to sell more maglev trains , which use magnets to lift the train a few centimeters -lrb- inches -rrb- into the air and propel it . two america n s killed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers rescued the bodies from the wreck alexander retemeyer , a public prosecutor , meanwhile said two of those killed were us nationals , but most of the dead came from two small german towns .
the train carries visitors during durability tests .
passengers were family members and friends of employees at iabg , the track 's operator .
others worked for the energy provider rwe , officials said . he said investigators were concentrating on what happened in the control room of the system , where a green light had been given for the train to proceed although the maintenance vehicle was doing its daily check for branches and other debris on the track . local officials said the wrecked train would be left on the track while experts combed the debris for more clues . german news magazine focus reported saturday that among the 10 survivors of the crash had been the two crew of the maintenance vehicle .
they had jumped clear as the transrapid came hurtling towards them at 170 kilometers per hour . spokesman dieter sturm of the emsland regional district said the identification of the human remains was continuing .
all injured survivors were now in stable condition , sturm said . it was germany 's deadliest railway crash since a high-speed inter city express passenger train crashed into a bridge support in the town of eschede in 1998 , killing 101 people in the nation 's worst train wreck . tra n sport mi n ister to discuss future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shanghai train caught fire in august but no one was killed the maglev train was developed by german firms siemens and thyssenkrupp in the 1980s .
the 31.5-kilometer test track has been in operation since 1984 . german chancellor angela merkel traveled to the crash scene on friday .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee arrived saturday at the crash scene from china where he had discussed a maglev sale and other issues . tiefensee has scheduled a meeting with the train developers on sunday to discuss the ramifications of the crash and figure out whether it will have consequences for transrapid 's future . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transrapid train crash claims 23 lives in germany german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of a german high-speed train crash on a test route in emsland where 23 people died when the transrapid train hit a maintenance vehicle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.09.2006 bayern munich 's manager envisions ipo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more trophies like these may happen only if bayern go public european soccer knows practically no limits when it comes to money .
in the process though , top clubs are amassing debts while wannabe 's try to keep pace .
bayern munich 's general manager thinks going public is an answer . by no means does bayern munich general manager uli hoeness mince words - particularly when it comes to fair competition in europe , which he underscored recently by bemoaning the " russianization " of soccer .
of course he meant owner roman abramovich of london club chelsea and the 410 million euros -lrb- $ 520 million -rrb- the oil tycoon is paying his superstar-packed squad this season .
that sum is twice munich 's payroll , something that is causing headaches for bayern 's bosses . but hoeness is also hugely ambitious and will not idly stand by while clubs like milan , barcelona , and naturally chelsea , shift into high gear and leave germany ’ s most successful team in the dust . so if bayern munich will never have a mega-wealthy patron the likes of abramovich - one person can not have a controlling interest in a professional team in germany - it will have to seek other means to maintain its position as one of europe 's premiere teams .
hoeness thinks that taking the club public will provide the needed capital . he told the sports web site sport 1 that bayern munich is a " prime candidate " for the stock market . " we are profitable , have no debts and have our own stadium , " he said . bidi n g his time patie n tly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's allianz arena is one of the best in germany the conditions seem optimal for munich but a public offering is not in the cards in the near future .
to take that final step , hoeness would have to have a larger say than he currently does as general manager .
the most important voice at the moment belongs to team president franz beckenbauer .
that should end by 2009 according to hoeness . " my contract -lrb- as gm -rrb- expires in 2009 , as well as franz beckenbauer 's presidency , " he told sport 1 .
" it is planned that franz beckenbauer will no longer run for that post and i will become president .
we will have to see that we have a successor for me by 2009 . " hoeness , who once starred as a midfielder with beckenbauer on some of bayern munich 's best teams in the 1970 's , will have to maintain an attitude of wait and see regarding taking the club public .
although bayern own the rights to the allianz arena , their local rivals 1860 munich , who themselves are navigating difficult financial waters , could regain the share they sold to bayern in the spring .
that is an incalculable factor that very much affects bayern 's future income . playi n g i n the big league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and meier were chased out of dortmund the price that teams have to pay to play big league european soccer is not insubstantial , running in the hundreds of millions , if not billions of euros . in the late 1990 's , while riding a wave of success in europe that was highlighted by a champions league victory in 1997 , borussia dortmund took that leap of faith .
they became germany 's first and only public professional soccer team , going on the market in october 2000 during the dot.com boom .
then front office manager michael meier placed a risky wager by bringing in more top-name players who in turn had to excel . but the bet did n't pay off as the team 's performance on the pitch flatlined .
income from european club competitions dried up , driving dortmund to the brink of bankruptcy .
angry stockholders , many tried-and-true borussia fans , drove meier and president gerd niebaum from their offices in early 2005 . when and if bayern munich does finally decide to go public , it most likely will have the whole-hearted backing of its supporters .
the team announced this week that its membership roll surpassed the 120,000 mark , making it according to club officials , the second-largest club by member numbers behind last year 's champions league victors fc barcelona . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia 's newly monied tycoons are getting into soccer three prominent english clubs are in the hands of billionaires .

but not everyone is in favor of legalizing the oldest profession in the world . prostitution is colloquially called " the oldest profession in the world , " but its legalities are still debated .
throughout europe , especially in eastern european counties , it is a contested issue .
in ukraine and albania , people are not permitted to sell their bodies , and the men and women who do are tracked down and punished . sweden approaches prostitution very differently : only the customers of prostitutes are punished .
france , belgium , england and other nations have completely done away with laws regulating prostitution .
prostitutes live in the shadows of society in those nations ; procuration , however , is against the law . in germany , the netherlands , switzerland and in some regions of spain and greece , prostitution has been legalized and regulated during the past few years .
in these countries , prostitutes of both sexes are now called " sex workers . " no u n iformity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women chose to be prostitutes , others are forced in other words , there is no uniform policy on the legalities of prostitution across the european continent - on voluntary prostitution , that is .
the incongruous policies on voluntary prostitution , however , dramatically impede efforts in fighting forced prostitution and human trafficking in europe . the council of europe , a 46-member organization that 's distinct from the european union , recently held a meeting to discuss ways to standardize laws on prostitution across the continent .
the findings will soon be presented to member states , which may decide on formulating a uniform , european-wide policy on the trade . " i think what is very important is that the 46 member-states of the council of europe can eventually reach a place in which they draft a uniform policy on prostitution in europe and foster a shared tolerance toward sex workers , " said rosemarie zapfl-helbling , who led the meeting . not everyo n e i n vited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some russian prostitutes , like these , ultimately come to western europe to work but malka marcovich , who heads the european branch of the ngo " coalition against the trafficking of women , " said she would like to see prostitution banned .
marcovich requested a place on the panel of the meeting , but was turned down .
representatives from the french government were not even invited , she added . " the minister for the equal treatment of women in france made an official announcement at a united nations meeting in 2000 , equating prostitution with violence against women , " marcovich said .
" but what was meant was not only the actual violence that customers may inflict on prostitutes .
violence can also be defined as having sex when you do n't feel like it - even if , in certain cases , women are being paid for it . " marcovich added that " societies must ask themselves whether it is really only a personal matter when a person decides to become a prostitute , or whether that society wants to permit a form of sexuality that is based on wide divisions in equality between the sexes . " equal opportu n ities yet the council of europe 's commission for the equality between men and women is apparently aiming to help prostitutes who have chosen to be sex workers gain equal opportunities in society .
the commission invited a british woman named chris to sit on the panel . chris has been selling her body via the internet for the past decade .
she also wants sex workers to enjoy the same rights europe-wide as any other worker . " i do not anticipate that more recognition for the sex industry and sex workers will be created through laws - that is , from the top down , " she said .
" that will not happen overnight . " " but a lot of things have changed in society , " she added .
" people used to say it was a crazy idea when women were fighting for the right to vote .
homosexuality is also now more widely accepted than it used to be .
as far as prostitution goes , society is currently in a process of becoming more tolerant toward it . " co n sideri n g the drawbacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women around the world , like this afghan woman , are sold into prostitution as girls still , there are two signs to the coin in legalizing prostitution .
on the one hand , some prostitutes say that legalization permits them to be officially self-employed and recognized , as is the case in the netherlands . but there are drawbacks to that , said sophie jekeler , who runs an ngo in belgium that helps prostitutes , including those who are trying to leave the sex trade . " when prostitution was legalized in holland , many dutch prostitutes started coming over the border to belgium to work , " jekeler said , adding that many women become prostitutes because they need the money .
" here they can remain anonymous and do not have to officially register themselves as prostitutes .
these women do not want their families and friends finding out how they earn their money .

work and pensions secretary john hutton called for a " proper election " , telling the times : " we do n't do coronations in the labour party . "
but he refused to say whether or not he would stand for the post .
his comments come ahead of mr blair 's last labour conference as leader .
the event begins in manchester on sunday . "
i think -lsb- an election -rsb- is something gordon himself has acknowledged would be good for the labour party " john hutton work and pensions secretary profile : john hutton mr hutton told the paper : " i think there is an agreement that having a leadership election ... could be a good thing for the labour party .
" i think that is something gordon himself has acknowledged would be good for the labour party .
we do n't do coronations in the labour party .
we have elections to choose our leader .
" and that is how , i think , we should choose our next leader .
there should be a proper election . "
bbc political correspondent robin brant said while a long line of cabinet ministers had emerged to back the chancellor as the new leader , mr hutton was keener to make sure there was a contest .
battle hints at the moment backbencher john mcdonnell is the only labour mp to have pledged to fight mr brown for the job .
but mr hutton is hinting at a battle between two heavyweights , says our correspondent .
the pensions secretary has refused to say if he will be the one to make sure that happens .
the comments could be seen as provocative - coming from a man stridently loyal to mr blair , our correspondent adds .
last week , health secretary patricia hewitt suggested the public should be able to vote for the next labour leader , with contenders taking part in a series of debates .
meanwhile , a poll conducted by populus for the times on saturday suggests mr blair will not go down in history as a great prime minister in the minds of the public .
its poll - based on interviews with 1,007 adults between september 8 and september 10 - revealed only 6 % of people think that is how mr blair will be remembered .
some 38 % think he will be remembered as a good prime minister , down from 42 % a year ago .
eighteen per cent of people think mr blair will be remembered as a bad prime minister , according to the poll .

last week , health secretary patricia hewitt suggested the public should be able to vote for the next labour leader , with contenders taking part in a series of debates .
meanwhile , a poll conducted by populus for the times on saturday suggests mr blair will not go down in history as a great prime minister in the minds of the public .
its poll - based on interviews with 1,007 adults between september 8 and september 10 - revealed only 6 % of people think that is how mr blair will be remembered .
some 38 % think he will be remembered as a good prime minister , down from 42 % a year ago .
eighteen per cent of people think mr blair will be remembered as a bad prime minister , according to the poll .

reduced price microsoft has said that it will start selling blue dragon bundled with a reduced price xbox 360 console when the game is launched in early december .
other games aimed at the japanese market include namco bandai 's newly named eternal sonata .
the company are also pushing their online gaming service xbox live in japan , teaming up with developers konami , namco bandai and capcom to offer arcade style downloads .

success in japan is a rite of passage in the gaming world ; the market is one that can almost make or break a console .
sony , for example , sold more than 23 million of its playstation 2 consoles in japan .
worldwide it has sold more than 100 million since its launch in 2000 .
conversely by the end of 2005 microsoft had sold just 1.8 million of the original xbox in asia , including japan , out of a global total of 22 million .
admitted problems " we did n't get the right content and we admit that we did n't do a great job here , " mr moore told the bbc news website at the tokyo games show .

blue dragon is a key title , if xbox is to crack japan according to figures released at the start of september by research firm enterbrain , microsoft has so far sold 158,654 of its xbox 360 console with more than 5 million units sold worldwide .
" we need to give japanese gamers a compelling reason to buy and i think this is it , " mr moore said , talking about the line-up of new titles designed for japanese gamers .
one of the most anticipated titles is mistwalker 's blue dragon , a quirky role playing game that has already set the tokyo games show buzzing .
the game features artwork by acclaimed japanese cartoon artist akira toriyama and music by the same composer that wrote the score to the hugely successful final fantasy series .
mistwalkers other game debuted at the tokyo games show , lost odyssey , features characters designed by japanese manga artist takehiko inoue .
reduced price microsoft has said that it will start selling blue dragon bundled with a reduced price xbox 360 console when the game is launched in early december .
other games aimed at the japanese market include namco bandai 's newly named eternal sonata .
the company are also pushing their online gaming service xbox live in japan , teaming up with developers konami , namco bandai and capcom to offer arcade style downloads .
" we 're doing a lot to feel more japanese , less american and less like an imported product , " said mr moore .
" i 'm very heartened to see the excitement around out booth at the -lsb- tokyo -rsb- games show . "
the xbox remains a curiosity in japan the redmond based company are not just trying to break into japan with software .

doctors resent political interference chancellor gordon brown is believed to be considering the establishment of an independent nhs board .
under the plans , the board would take day-to-day control of the health service , leaving ministers to set budgets and strategic direction .
professor julian le grand , a former health adviser to tony blair and now the professor of social policy at the london school of economics , gives his view on the plans .
" almost anything that would insulate ministers from having to stand up in the house of commons and defend everything that goes on in the nhs is a good idea .
there is a case for having ministers dealing with the strategic objectives , and leaving the day-by-day operations to someone else professor julian le grand " the nhs is absolutely huge .
by 2008 it will be consuming something like 0.3 % of the gdp of the entire planet , and the idea that one person , however able they are , can actually deal with all the minutiae that go on in the nhs , absolutely everything from a bed pan dropping off a bed to a cancelled operation , is frankly absurd .
" there is a case for having ministers dealing with the strategic objectives , and leaving the day-by-day operations to someone else .
" but the parallel with the bbc is an interesting one .
the bbc works for one rather good reason - it is a kind of independent corporation , but it is operating in a ferociously competitive market .
" if you hand over the control of the nhs to this independent board , there is a danger that you are going to create not so much a bbc , operating competively , and responsive to the needs and wants of the people who are listening to it , or watching its programmes , but something more like one of the old nationalised industries , which was not an efficient and effective way of running a service . "
interest rates mr brown 's proposals have been compared to his widely praised decision on his first day in office to give the bank of england independence to set interest rates .
however , professor le grand said people should be careful before drawing comparisions too closely .
he said : " the bank of england independence was about making one decision about just one number : interest rates .
" it is a very complex decision , but it is very different from actually providing a day-by-day service , which is what the nhs does , with millions of people being involved in its activities every day .
" and again the bank of england is not exactly providing a service in a competitive environment , so we have got to be a little careful about drawing that parallel .
historical parallel " one of the ironies is that in some ways we are going back to the old idea behind the nhs originally .
" in 1948 the idea was that the politicians would set the budget , and the people who worked in the nhs - at that time thought to be only doctors - would run it .
" in practice both sides let down their side of the bargain .
the doctors started challenging the politicians to provide more money , and the politicians said if we are going to provide more money , we have got to have some say in how that money is spent .
" that is a tension that i think will still be present in whatever system we devise . "

" it is a very complex decision , but it is very different from actually providing a day-by-day service , which is what the nhs does , with millions of people being involved in its activities every day .
" and again the bank of england is not exactly providing a service in a competitive environment , so we have got to be a little careful about drawing that parallel .
historical parallel " one of the ironies is that in some ways we are going back to the old idea behind the nhs originally .
" in 1948 the idea was that the politicians would set the budget , and the people who worked in the nhs - at that time thought to be only doctors - would run it .
" in practice both sides let down their side of the bargain .
the doctors started challenging the politicians to provide more money , and the politicians said if we are going to provide more money , we have got to have some say in how that money is spent .
" that is a tension that i think will still be present in whatever system we devise . "

doctors resent political interference chancellor gordon brown is believed to be considering the establishment of an independent nhs board .
under the plans , the board would take day-to-day control of the health service , leaving ministers to set budgets and strategic direction .
professor julian le grand , a former health adviser to tony blair and now the professor of social policy at the london school of economics , gives his view on the plans .
" almost anything that would insulate ministers from having to stand up in the house of commons and defend everything that goes on in the nhs is a good idea .
there is a case for having ministers dealing with the strategic objectives , and leaving the day-by-day operations to someone else professor julian le grand " the nhs is absolutely huge .
by 2008 it will be consuming something like 0.3 % of the gdp of the entire planet , and the idea that one person , however able they are , can actually deal with all the minutiae that go on in the nhs , absolutely everything from a bed pan dropping off a bed to a cancelled operation , is frankly absurd .
" there is a case for having ministers dealing with the strategic objectives , and leaving the day-by-day operations to someone else .
" but the parallel with the bbc is an interesting one .
the bbc works for one rather good reason - it is a kind of independent corporation , but it is operating in a ferociously competitive market .
" if you hand over the control of the nhs to this independent board , there is a danger that you are going to create not so much a bbc , operating competively , and responsive to the needs and wants of the people who are listening to it , or watching its programmes , but something more like one of the old nationalised industries , which was not an efficient and effective way of running a service . "
interest rates mr brown 's proposals have been compared to his widely praised decision on his first day in office to give the bank of england independence to set interest rates .

chris warwick , who is now a druid , said places like paviland cave on gower should be treated the same way as modern graveyards .
a skeleton , about 26,000 years old , was discovered in the cave in the 1800s and dubbed the red lady of paviland .
mr warwick is setting up a group called " dead to rights " to work for the return of remains to such sites .
the druid is spending the weekend in the limestone cave to highlight his cause and to try to " balance the spiritual energies " .
" our feeling is that it is n't just modern graveyards that should be considered as sacred sites , but anywhere that a body has been buried with ceremonial intent , " he said .
" we have formed a little group called dead to rights , to work for the return of remains to the sites they were buried in and hopefully have them reburied there with due ceremony .
" the sites would be regarded as sacred thereafter . "
discovered remains mr warwick told bbc wales there were plenty of sites across the world where bodies had been buried in pre-historical times .
he said he had decided to sleep in the cave so he could get in touch with the ancestors and find out what was " amiss " with the burial site .
" there 's obviously going to be something amiss since the bones and the grave goods have been removed .
-lsb- i -rsb- then try to do what i can to alleviate the balance .
the remains of the red lady of paviland were discovered by palaeontologist and clergyman reverend william buckland , who removed them from the cave .
rev buckland mistakenly assumed the skeleton was female - as it was dyed red - and dated back to roman times .
it has since been identified as a man and many thousands of years older .
grave robbing the skeleton was taken to oxford university , where it remains .
the dead to rights group believes the removal of the bones was a " desecration " of a sacred site and says they should be reburied in the cave or nearby " with due reverence " .
mr warwick said he was happy for archaeologists to photograph and examine burial sites .
he added : " the more we find out about our ancestors the better , as far as i 'm concerned .
what i do object to though is the grave robbing that goes on - whichever way you put it , that 's what it is . "
