brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .

in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .

not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .

the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

" any incentive that does not include iran 's right to nuclear technology and the ways to secure it will not have any attraction for the iranian people and government , " the irna agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as telling reporters in indonesia . he also warned the europeans " not to make the same mistake " they did last august when they came up with a list of incentives that also asked iran to give up uranium enrichment . " we hope that our case will be dealt in a way that iran 's right to peaceful nuclear technology will be recognized ...
it is then that iran will provide its utmost cooperation , " he said in bali , where he is attending summit of the d-8 developing countries with president mahmoud ahmadinejad . european union efforts since 2003 to win guarantees that iran is not making nuclear weapons have foundered , with iran pushing ahead since april on enriching uranium .
this sensitive process is used to make nuclear reactor fuel but in highly enriched form the uranium can form the explosive core of an atomic bomb .
new incentives the united states charges that iran is using its nuclear program , which tehran insists is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , to hide the development of nuclear weapons .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2006 german conservatives want linguistic law to protect language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative politicians want german words back on signs and products germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- wants the german language to be protected in the country 's constitution by a " linguistic law " which will keep the spread of english words at bay . the csu , the bavarian sister party of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , believes that a constitutional amendment that makes german a " staatssprache " - language of state - would help in the continuing struggle for integration in the country . " the german language is the basic condition for living together in our country , " csu secretary general markus söder told focus magazine .
" we need a visible sign that the german language is the most important factor in all our integration efforts . " the csu 's call follows on from a similar statement from cdu member of parliament erika steinbach , who recently called for the language to be legally protected . steinbach wants english words which have crept into everyday german life , such as information in shops , product labels and signs in railway stations and airports , to be banished . no n -e n glish speaki n g germa n s bei n g excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english is taking over in some sectors steinbach told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that her major concern was for almost a third of the german population who do not speak any english . " the english language edges out german more and more in certain areas of everyday life , " she said .
" but 30 percent of people do n't speak english and they are ashamed to admit that .
therefore , these people are being excluded .
that 's why the demand for a law to protect the german language has many supporters . " the german vocabulary consists of around 500,000 words ; between 3,000 and 5,000 are direct anglicisms which are used in the media and advertising .
many are used because there are no equivalents in the german language while others would take on a completely different meaning if directly translated from english into german . german literary legend johann wolfgang von goethe himself once said that the germans should let foreign words into their language as they would enrich it . fear of a n a n glicized germa n future but there are many people these days - and not just conservative politicians - who oppose that thinking and fear that english will one day edge german out in its native country . " in 20 years , german city halls may only have forms in english , " rudolf hoberg from the society for the german language told focus .
" we want to do everything we can to prevent that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pressures of modern life are also felt by languages however , the editorial staff at duden - the compilers and publishers of german dictionaries and language books - believe that nothing can be done to protect the german language in terms of drafting a " linguistic law . " globalizatio n makes protectio n difficult matthias wermke , editor-in-chief at duden , said he believes that external forces will always put pressure on languages . " in the age of globalization , nothing can be done to efficiently protect the german language unless foreign-language advertisements and product labels are forbidden , " he said . experts believe that the only way that german can survive in the long run is for both native speakers and migrants to be encouraged to speak the language and constantly strive to perfect their spoken and written german .
learning the german language should also be promoted abroad . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do i become german ?

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .

once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .

naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .

" the german language is the basic condition for living together in our country , " csu secretary general markus söder told focus magazine .
" we need a visible sign that the german language is the most important factor in all our integration efforts . " the csu 's call follows on from a similar statement from cdu member of parliament erika steinbach , who recently called for the language to be legally protected . steinbach wants english words which have crept into everyday german life , such as information in shops , product labels and signs in railway stations and airports , to be banished . no n -e n glish speaki n g germa n s bei n g excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english is taking over in some sectors steinbach told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that her major concern was for almost a third of the german population who do not speak any english .

" in the age of globalization , nothing can be done to efficiently protect the german language unless foreign-language advertisements and product labels are forbidden , " he said . experts believe that the only way that german can survive in the long run is for both native speakers and migrants to be encouraged to speak the language and constantly strive to perfect their spoken and written german .

" a cruise has become an option for normal vactioners , " said german travel association vice-president johannes zurnieden .
he said he expected the industry to grow by 7 percent to 9 percent in 2006 . in 2005 , the number of germans booking cruises increased by nearly 10 last year and revenues up 7.2 percent to 1.22 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.56 billion -rrb- with the industry continuing to develop new ideas , said alexis papathanassis , a professor of cruise management at the bremerhaven university . theme cruises with on-ship entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ships have become floating entertainment centers " there are a couple of interesting concepts on the market , such as club cruises , " papathanassis said , adding that cruises need to fit the people booking them .
" for some customers a german travel guide is enormously important , others have an easier time dealing with other languages if the price is right . " john will of transocean tours said theme cruises are also a popular development in the cruise industry . " this summer we are offering a cruise that follows in emigrants footsteps in the classic emigrant route from bremenhaven to new york , " will said of the cruise that will have an emigration expert from the university of oldenburg on board .
" before leaving you can visit the german emigration center and then see ellis island in new york . " most germans , however , are sticking to shorter trips of a week or less on european waters , while the british and americans , where the number of vacationing cruisers has doubled and quadrupled , respectively , tend to take longer cruises , according to zurnieden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen mary ii pulls into hamburg german harbors popular with foreign ships but german ports also stand to gain from foreign ships , according to dirk moldenhauer , head of the hamburg cruise center . " naturally the city 's attractiveness and the proximity to berlin - 90 minutes in an express train - make hamburg especially well-liked by cruise companies , " he said . godehard weyerer -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

he said he expected the industry to grow by 7 percent to 9 percent in 2006 . in 2005 , the number of germans booking cruises increased by nearly 10 last year and revenues up 7.2 percent to 1.22 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.56 billion -rrb- with the industry continuing to develop new ideas , said alexis papathanassis , a professor of cruise management at the bremerhaven university . theme cruises with on-ship entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ships have become floating entertainment centers " there are a couple of interesting concepts on the market , such as club cruises , " papathanassis said , adding that cruises need to fit the people booking them .

" john will of transocean tours said theme cruises are also a popular development in the cruise industry . " this summer we are offering a cruise that follows in emigrants footsteps in the classic emigrant route from bremenhaven to new york , " will said of the cruise that will have an emigration expert from the university of oldenburg on board .
" before leaving you can visit the german emigration center and then see ellis island in new york . " most germans , however , are sticking to shorter trips of a week or less on european waters , while the british and americans , where the number of vacationing cruisers has doubled and quadrupled , respectively , tend to take longer cruises , according to zurnieden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen mary ii pulls into hamburg german harbors popular with foreign ships but german ports also stand to gain from foreign ships , according to dirk moldenhauer , head of the hamburg cruise center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2006 german conservatives want linguistic law to protect language großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservative politicians want german words back on signs and products germany 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- wants the german language to be protected in the country 's constitution by a " linguistic law " which will keep the spread of english words at bay . the csu , the bavarian sister party of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , believes that a constitutional amendment that makes german a " staatssprache " - language of state - would help in the continuing struggle for integration in the country . " the german language is the basic condition for living together in our country , " csu secretary general markus söder told focus magazine .
" we need a visible sign that the german language is the most important factor in all our integration efforts . " the csu 's call follows on from a similar statement from cdu member of parliament erika steinbach , who recently called for the language to be legally protected . steinbach wants english words which have crept into everyday german life , such as information in shops , product labels and signs in railway stations and airports , to be banished . no n -e n glish speaki n g germa n s bei n g excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english is taking over in some sectors steinbach told the mass-circulation bild newspaper that her major concern was for almost a third of the german population who do not speak any english . " the english language edges out german more and more in certain areas of everyday life , " she said .
" but 30 percent of people do n't speak english and they are ashamed to admit that .
therefore , these people are being excluded .
that 's why the demand for a law to protect the german language has many supporters . " the german vocabulary consists of around 500,000 words ; between 3,000 and 5,000 are direct anglicisms which are used in the media and advertising .
many are used because there are no equivalents in the german language while others would take on a completely different meaning if directly translated from english into german . german literary legend johann wolfgang von goethe himself once said that the germans should let foreign words into their language as they would enrich it . fear of a n a n glicized germa n future but there are many people these days - and not just conservative politicians - who oppose that thinking and fear that english will one day edge german out in its native country . " in 20 years , german city halls may only have forms in english , " rudolf hoberg from the society for the german language told focus .
" we want to do everything we can to prevent that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pressures of modern life are also felt by languages however , the editorial staff at duden - the compilers and publishers of german dictionaries and language books - believe that nothing can be done to protect the german language in terms of drafting a " linguistic law . " globalizatio n makes protectio n difficult matthias wermke , editor-in-chief at duden , said he believes that external forces will always put pressure on languages . " in the age of globalization , nothing can be done to efficiently protect the german language unless foreign-language advertisements and product labels are forbidden , " he said . experts believe that the only way that german can survive in the long run is for both native speakers and migrants to be encouraged to speak the language and constantly strive to perfect their spoken and written german .
learning the german language should also be promoted abroad . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do i become german ?

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

" any incentive that does not include iran 's right to nuclear technology and the ways to secure it will not have any attraction for the iranian people and government , " the irna agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as telling reporters in indonesia . he also warned the europeans " not to make the same mistake " they did last august when they came up with a list of incentives that also asked iran to give up uranium enrichment . " we hope that our case will be dealt in a way that iran 's right to peaceful nuclear technology will be recognized ...
it is then that iran will provide its utmost cooperation , " he said in bali , where he is attending summit of the d-8 developing countries with president mahmoud ahmadinejad . european union efforts since 2003 to win guarantees that iran is not making nuclear weapons have foundered , with iran pushing ahead since april on enriching uranium .
this sensitive process is used to make nuclear reactor fuel but in highly enriched form the uranium can form the explosive core of an atomic bomb .
new incentives the united states charges that iran is using its nuclear program , which tehran insists is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , to hide the development of nuclear weapons .

" any incentive that does not include iran 's right to nuclear technology and the ways to secure it will not have any attraction for the iranian people and government , " the irna agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as telling reporters in indonesia . he also warned the europeans " not to make the same mistake " they did last august when they came up with a list of incentives that also asked iran to give up uranium enrichment . " we hope that our case will be dealt in a way that iran 's right to peaceful nuclear technology will be recognized ...
it is then that iran will provide its utmost cooperation , " he said in bali , where he is attending summit of the d-8 developing countries with president mahmoud ahmadinejad . european union efforts since 2003 to win guarantees that iran is not making nuclear weapons have foundered , with iran pushing ahead since april on enriching uranium .
this sensitive process is used to make nuclear reactor fuel but in highly enriched form the uranium can form the explosive core of an atomic bomb .
new incentives the united states charges that iran is using its nuclear program , which tehran insists is a peaceful effort to generate electricity , to hide the development of nuclear weapons .

" a successful world cup and an agreement with klinsmann would be perfect , " beckenbauer told public broadcaster ard .
" but if for some reason klinsmann does not want to carry on after the world cup we need to have someone in mind . " long one of klinsmann 's loudest critics , the kaiser did n't give the current national team coach much of a chance to prove himself in front of the home crowd during the finals , which run from june 9 to july 9 . " if the team crashes out of the tournament early on with a disappointing performance then questions have to be asked , " beckenbauer added .
" then -lrb- his position -rrb- would be unsustainable . " klinsmann took over from rudi voller as german national coach in august 2004 after germany failed to win a single match at the 2004 european championships . the former bayern munich player and current california resident , is contracted until the end of the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , but has refused to sign an extension saying his future hinges on how hosts germany perform at the world cup . three-time winners germany open the world cup against costa rica in munich on june 9 before further group matches against poland and ecuador . dw-world.de klinsmann relief as germany crushes usa in friendly world cup hosts germany crushed the united states 4-1 at home on wednesday for a much-needed morale boost ahead of this summer 's soccer extravaganza .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2006 iran insists european offer must recognize enrichment right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says uranium enrichment is its right iran on saturday warned that new european incentives to find a deal over its atomic program would only be of interest if the offer recognized the country 's right to uranium enrichment . " any incentive that does not include iran 's right to nuclear technology and the ways to secure it will not have any attraction for the iranian people and government , " the irna agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as telling reporters in indonesia . he also warned the europeans " not to make the same mistake " they did last august when they came up with a list of incentives that also asked iran to give up uranium enrichment . " we hope that our case will be dealt in a way that iran 's right to peaceful nuclear technology will be recognized ...
it is then that iran will provide its utmost cooperation , " he said in bali , where he is attending summit of the d-8 developing countries with president mahmoud ahmadinejad . european union efforts since 2003 to win guarantees that iran is not making nuclear weapons have foundered , with iran pushing ahead since april on enriching uranium .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

" globalizatio n makes protectio n difficult matthias wermke , editor-in-chief at duden , said he believes that external forces will always put pressure on languages . " in the age of globalization , nothing can be done to efficiently protect the german language unless foreign-language advertisements and product labels are forbidden , " he said . experts believe that the only way that german can survive in the long run is for both native speakers and migrants to be encouraged to speak the language and constantly strive to perfect their spoken and written german .

" a cruise has become an option for normal vactioners , " said german travel association vice-president johannes zurnieden .
he said he expected the industry to grow by 7 percent to 9 percent in 2006 . in 2005 , the number of germans booking cruises increased by nearly 10 last year and revenues up 7.2 percent to 1.22 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.56 billion -rrb- with the industry continuing to develop new ideas , said alexis papathanassis , a professor of cruise management at the bremerhaven university . theme cruises with on-ship entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ships have become floating entertainment centers " there are a couple of interesting concepts on the market , such as club cruises , " papathanassis said , adding that cruises need to fit the people booking them .

" before leaving you can visit the german emigration center and then see ellis island in new york . " most germans , however , are sticking to shorter trips of a week or less on european waters , while the british and americans , where the number of vacationing cruisers has doubled and quadrupled , respectively , tend to take longer cruises , according to zurnieden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen mary ii pulls into hamburg german harbors popular with foreign ships but german ports also stand to gain from foreign ships , according to dirk moldenhauer , head of the hamburg cruise center .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history .

in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .

not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

" a cruise has become an option for normal vactioners , " said german travel association vice-president johannes zurnieden .
he said he expected the industry to grow by 7 percent to 9 percent in 2006 . in 2005 , the number of germans booking cruises increased by nearly 10 last year and revenues up 7.2 percent to 1.22 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.56 billion -rrb- with the industry continuing to develop new ideas , said alexis papathanassis , a professor of cruise management at the bremerhaven university . theme cruises with on-ship entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ships have become floating entertainment centers " there are a couple of interesting concepts on the market , such as club cruises , " papathanassis said , adding that cruises need to fit the people booking them .
" for some customers a german travel guide is enormously important , others have an easier time dealing with other languages if the price is right . " john will of transocean tours said theme cruises are also a popular development in the cruise industry . " this summer we are offering a cruise that follows in emigrants footsteps in the classic emigrant route from bremenhaven to new york , " will said of the cruise that will have an emigration expert from the university of oldenburg on board .
" before leaving you can visit the german emigration center and then see ellis island in new york . " most germans , however , are sticking to shorter trips of a week or less on european waters , while the british and americans , where the number of vacationing cruisers has doubled and quadrupled , respectively , tend to take longer cruises , according to zurnieden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen mary ii pulls into hamburg german harbors popular with foreign ships but german ports also stand to gain from foreign ships , according to dirk moldenhauer , head of the hamburg cruise center .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

brazilian-born , but now a costa rican citizen , guimaraes is leading the team to its second consecutive world cup finals . dw-world.de : how have costa rica 's preparations for the world cup been going so far ? alexandre guimaraes : we started our last phase of preparation on may 9 , one month before the opening game against germany .
until we fly to germany on may 17 there will be a lot of very stringent tactical technical and psychological preparation .
we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .

we 'll have two to three training sessions a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some costa rican fans will make the trip to germany how important is this time ? it is essential .
the time for words is already over .
now there is only time to work , to show what we can do and to achieve what we want .
these days are important for the team to meld together into a group so we can reach top form .
we have to stick close to each other until we get to germany .
once we get there a series of exhibition matches will begin , and we will use those to push our plans forward . what do you mean when you talk about psychological preparation ? it is a very normal part of our plans , not , as many people falsely believe , to convince the players not to be afraid of the opponents .
after taking part in two world cups , costa rica does not have these fears , we put ourselves on the same level as our opponents .
by psychological preparations i mean increasing our motivation and self-confidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paulo wanchope is one of costa rica 's strikers that seems to fit the team slogan : " we 're writing history . " i 'm not familiar with a slogan … team captain , luis marin , filled me in . i think it 's fitting .
marin and the other guys came up with something good .
" we 're writing history " summarizes both our spirit and our desire to take advantage of our chances and show our progress at the germany world cup . what is the mood like in costa rica and the national team in terms of the world cup ? the country has enormous expectations and is 100 percent behind the team .
in the team , i can feel a strengthened cohesion and , at the same time , a certain impatience for june 9 to come quickly .
the players want to get on the world cup field and get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : costa rica will be staying in walldorf during the 2006 world cup what is the key to costa rica 's success at the world cup ? our game against ecuador .
not because it 's ecuador , but because it 's our second game .
experience has shown that in a world cup it 's the second game that 's always the crucial one .
naturally , the result against germany also plays a role , but independent of that , the game against ecuador has a significant meaning . have you been observing your opponents ? of course , and very closely , just like the others are putting costa rica under the microscope .
we 've come to know each other very well , but that wo n't change the fact that whoever gets the most points will make the trip into the next round .
that 's our goal . the team you 're taking to germany is a mix of young and experienced players . yes , i 'm absolutely convinced that we can achieve great things with it .
this mix is no accident .
costa rica is thinking about the present , germany in 2006 , as well as the future , south africa in 2010 .
we want to keep our form so we remain a participant in future world cups .
that 's one reason why we need to make sure there are young players in the team .
this world cup is the beginning of the next one .

canadian wildlife officials say it is the offspring of a male grizzly bear and a female polar bear .
there have long been stories of oddly coloured bears living in regions where the two territories overlap .
but until now , grizzly-polar hybrids , dubbed " grolar bears " or " pizzlies " , have been found only in zoos .
the hybrid bear was shot last month by an american big game hunter on banks island , northwest territories , canada .
his guide , roger kuptana , noticed the creature had the long claws and slightly humped back of a grizzly bear and thought it might be a hybrid .
the body was seized by officials , who sent a dna sample for tests which confirmed its unusual origins . "
there are behavioural differences between the species , including timing of mating seasons , that make hybrids highly unusual " david field , zoological society of london " it 's something we 've all known was theoretically possible because their habitats overlap a little bit and their breeding seasons overlap a little bit , " said ian stirling , a biologist at the canadian wildlife service in edmonton .
" it 's the first time it 's known to have happened in the wild . "
nanulak bear polar and grizzly bears have been bred together in zoos , but in the wild they rarely cross paths .
however , some grizzly bears have been seen venturing across the ice towards polar bear territory to search for food after emerging from hibernation .
this might explain how the rare union occurred .
" in the limited area where the two species ' ranges overlap , it is not entirely surprising that we might find a polar-grizzly hybrid , " said david field , zoological director of the zoological society of london .
" however , there are behavioural differences between the species , including timing of mating seasons , that make such hybrids highly unusual and it is unlikely that any resultant offspring would be viable . "
canadian wildlife officials are now thinking up a name for the creature .
some of the suggestions they have come up with so far are " pizzly " , " grolar bear " or " nanulak " , after the inuit names for polar bear -lrb- nanuk -rrb- and grizzly bear -lrb- aklak -rrb- .

the national public health service for wales -lrb- nphs -rrb- said the risk was small and all at risk would be contacted as soon as a list was completed .
the public health service has been working on the case since last year and an incident team has also been set up .

precautionary basis it added counselling and screening would be offered .
" the risk of patients contacting hepatitis c is very small and the contact programme is being taken on a precautionary basis , " the statement said .
hepatitis c means swelling or inflammation of the liver .
the virus is blood borne and is spread when blood of an infected person is spread into the bloodstream of another .
hepatitis c infection affects different people in different ways with many experience no symptoms at all while others experience extreme tiredness and can feel very unwell .

the time to assess his performance was after six months - not " a few weeks " , simon hughes told gmtv 's sunday programme .
on wednesday , party mps discussed sir menzies ' question time performances after they came under fire .
but frontbencher ed davey said that the party 's problems dated from charles kennedy 's time as leader .
mr kennedy stepped down after it emerged that he had a drink problem .
mr davey said : " you have got to remember where we were three or four months ago .
we have had a pretty traumatic time in the party .
" for some of us it actually went back quite a few years .
the party had n't been managed as well as it should be , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
the liberal democrat press office said it was looking at ways to improve sir menzies ' performance at prime minister 's questions -lrb- pmqs -rrb- .
possible changes might include to the sort of questions sir menzies asked .
and his chief of staff norman lamb has advised sir menzies to " relax and be himself " in the " bear pit " of the commons .
' take stock ' mr hughes , who came third in the recent leadership contest , said the party should " take stock " of sir menzies ' progress at the lib dem 's annual september conference .
in a pre-recorded interview , he told the sunday programme that sir menzies ' political experience was in foreign affairs and defence . "
-lsb- sir menzies -rsb- is a leader who is decisive and confident and making the right decisions " ed davey " that 's his expertise and on that ground there 's nobody who can better him and that remains the case .
obviously as leader you have to progress . "
mr hughes said it was " fair comment " to suggest more effort should be put into improving the leader 's performance during his weekly clashes with prime minister tony blair .
" ming is fully aware of that .
he will now have time to be in westminster and concentrating , but it 's not to be underestimated the work that needed to be done behind the scenes for getting the policies sorted . "
mr davey , the party 's trade and industry spokesman , defended his leader 's performance .
" some of us are judging ming now and we are seeing a leader who is decisive and confident and making the right decisions , " he said .
' bear pit ' mr lamb , who was promoted to chief of staff after sir menzies became leader in march , hit back at suggestions his boss was not dynamic enough . "
conservative and labour backbenchers are out to get him - it 's a bear pit that place " norman lamb lib dem chief of staff like every leader , sir menzies had advisers to help assist him in coming to terms with the " rather unusual environment " of pmqs , mr lamb told bbc radio five live .
" ming campbell , i think most people would agree , has been one of the most pre-eminent parliamentary performers in recent years and i think it is a question of getting used to a slightly different environment .

the time to assess his performance was after six months - not " a few weeks " , simon hughes told gmtv 's sunday programme .
on wednesday , party mps discussed sir menzies ' question time performances after they came under fire .
but frontbencher ed davey said that the party 's problems dated from charles kennedy 's time as leader .
mr kennedy stepped down after it emerged that he had a drink problem .
mr davey said : " you have got to remember where we were three or four months ago .
we have had a pretty traumatic time in the party .
" for some of us it actually went back quite a few years .
the party had n't been managed as well as it should be , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
the liberal democrat press office said it was looking at ways to improve sir menzies ' performance at prime minister 's questions -lrb- pmqs -rrb- .
possible changes might include to the sort of questions sir menzies asked .
and his chief of staff norman lamb has advised sir menzies to " relax and be himself " in the " bear pit " of the commons .
' take stock ' mr hughes , who came third in the recent leadership contest , said the party should " take stock " of sir menzies ' progress at the lib dem 's annual september conference .
in a pre-recorded interview , he told the sunday programme that sir menzies ' political experience was in foreign affairs and defence .
-lsb- sir menzies -rsb- is a leader who is decisive and confident and making the right decisions ed davey " that 's his expertise and on that ground there 's nobody who can better him and that remains the case .
obviously as leader you have to progress . "
mr hughes said it was " fair comment " to suggest more effort should be put into improving the leader 's performance during his weekly clashes with prime minister tony blair .
" ming is fully aware of that .
he will now have time to be in westminster and concentrating , but it 's not to be underestimated the work that needed to be done behind the scenes for getting the policies sorted . "
mr davey , the party 's trade and industry spokesman , defended his leader 's performance .
" some of us are judging ming now and we are seeing a leader who is decisive and confident and making the right decisions , " he said .
' bear pit ' mr lamb , who was promoted to chief of staff after sir menzies became leader in march , hit back at suggestions his boss was not dynamic enough .
conservative and labour backbenchers are out to get him - it 's a bear pit that place norman lamb lib dem chief of staff like every leader , sir menzies had advisers to help assist him in coming to terms with the " rather unusual environment " of pmqs , mr lamb told bbc radio five live .
" ming campbell , i think most people would agree , has been one of the most pre-eminent parliamentary performers in recent years and i think it is a question of getting used to a slightly different environment .
" both conservative and labour backbenchers are out to get him - it 's a bear pit that place . "
he added that one of his predecessors , paddy ashdown , had hated parliament and pmqs , and yet had ended up as an " impressive and successful " leader .

after the workshop people will be encouraged to log butterfly sightings so that numbers and types can be logged and help towards saving species .
volunteers are also needed to take part in a butterfly survey at mynydd marian nature reserve near llysfaen .
the first survey last year recorded 18 different types of butterfly .
saving the species leading the workshop will be jan miller from butterfly conservation , who said identifying the butterflies was the first step in saving the species from dying out .
a survey at the marian nature reserve last year found the rare silver studded blue butterfly was going from strength to strength , after being reintroduced to the area from the great orme in llandudno .
it is hoped those attending the workshop will get to see an example of the silver studded blue in the wild , but not until they have done some work in the classroom .
jan miller said monitoring is the first step to saving butterflies " during the workshop i will be explaining to people how to spot different butterflies , showing similar ones and a diagnostic way to spot the difference between them , then we will be going for a walk to spot a few butterflies , " said ms miller .
butterfly spotters will also be taught how to " walk a transect , " which is a scientific way to monitor butterflies in an area .
the first butterfly conservation reserve in wales was at eyarth rocks near ruthin .
the conservation work there has resulted in " quite an exciting increase " of the pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly , said ms miller , a species which is in steep decline elsewhere in britain .
she said that monitoring was the way forward to save butterflies , as the more people knew about them the more they could do to save them from dying out .
" it is very sad they 're dying out due to habitat loss , and recording them is the first step to protecting them , " she added .
the butterfly identification workshop will be held on sunday from 1400 - 1730pm bst at llysfaen village hall .
