program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : education in europe : a right not a privilege school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on sex education patchy in europe call for european history book as education ministers meet berlin school wants to profit from education germany -pipe- 06.09.2006 german parents wanting to homeschool turn to eu court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parents want their children to learn the three rs at home a hamburg family wanting to homeschool their children have been forced to flee the country in what lawyers say is not a unique case in germany .
parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .

the eu constitution is at the top , said german foreign minister steinmeier , over a year after it was shot down by french and dutch voters . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said this week in berlin at an annual meeting of the heads of german diplomatic missions that revitalizing plans for a european union constitution would be a top priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in the first half of 2007 .

" iran 's answers have not satisfied us , " merkel said in a speech to parliament .
" the door for diplomacy will not be shut but we will not merely look on while iran breaks the rules without taking action . " merkel said doing nothing " was not an option " while iran ignored calls by the united nations and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to end its uranium enrichment program . merkel 's comments were among the strongest from a european leader since iran ignored an aug .

the eu constitution is at the top , said german foreign minister steinmeier , over a year after it was shot down by french and dutch voters . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said this week in berlin at an annual meeting of the heads of german diplomatic missions that revitalizing plans for a european union constitution would be a top priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in the first half of 2007 . " we need this constitution so that we have a better representation in foreign and security policies , " said steinmeier . he added that not having an effective constitution could endanger both deeper integration within the union and relations with eu neighbor states , reported the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . controversy over current draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament approved the constitutional treaty , but not unanimously among the reforms included in the proposed document are the creation of an eu foreign minister post , simplified voting procedures and a permanent presidency to replace the current six-month rotation . the current draft of the eu constitutional treaty was put on the back burner after being rejected by referendum voters in france and the netherlands in mid-2005 . criticism of single-market economic policies , trends toward centralization , immigration policies and the euro were major factors in the " non " and " nee " votes . appeal for european unity french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , who was also at the conference , said that his country wanted to see a revival of the constitution project as well , despite last year 's referendum result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is nearing one year in office luxemburg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker said it will be germany 's task during the presidency to make an appeal for european unity . " half of the population wants more europe , the other half things that we already have too much europe , " said juncker , as reported by stern daily . all 25 european union member states must ratify the constitution for it to take effect .
national law determines if the decision is made by the parliamentary body or through a referendum vote . no concrete plan for changes the extent to which the existing document will be changed is under discussion . extensive changes would require the 16 countries that have already approved the document to review it again , while insufficient changes might not satisfy those states that rejected last year 's version . steinmeier said at the opening of the conference monday that europe 's relations with its neighbors to the east , energy security and diplomatic efforts in the middle east were additional priorities on germany 's 2007 presidential program . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit . " we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " said german finance minister peer steinbrück . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit .

the meeting was postponed due to unknown reasons . mottaki termed negotiations the best option for removing western concerns over iran 's nuclear programs and rejected other channels , including the un security council , as ineffective . while the eu and the us have warned that an end to diplomacy will mean the issue is taken to the united nations for discussions on possible sanctions , this is opposed by russia and china , both veto-wielding members of the security council . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.09.2006 delighted , not desperate , housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman 's days at tagesschau are over , for the time being at least what do women really want ?
definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .
herman has spent most of her life outside the treasured realm of freudian suppression known as domestic bliss . the joy of cooking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home , sweet home despite the fact or , perhaps , because of the fact that she never became a full-time mom , herman is nowadays germany 's most vocal proponent of a pre-feminist fantasy world in which women bake cookies , fold the laundry and water the plants as the ultimate form of self-fulfillment . her new book entitled " the eva principle - for a new femininity " will be published on sept .
8 .
even though the book can be only pre-ordered at this point , it is already no. 13 on the list of bestsellers at the german site of the online bookseller amazon . herman 's new book is expected to cause at least as much commotion as the article entitled " emancipation - an error ? " which she wrote for the may issue of the political magazine cicero .
in it , she blamed feminism for making women frustrated and for eating away family values in germany . it should come as no surprise that herman is not very popular in feminist circles . alice schwarzer , german feminist and editor of women 's magazine emma , described herman 's article on emancipation as " gibberish between a stone age bat and mother 's cross " - referring to a nazi-era medal of honor for german women who bore more than three children . reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german feminist author alice schwarzer is not amused by eva herman even inside the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a traditional harbinger of family values on the german political scene , herman 's views have been met with puzzlement . " this image of women is unacceptable in a modern society and it does n't correspond any longer to reality , " said marita meyer-kainer , a cdu parliamentarian in hamburg . herman , however , thinks she knows what 's wrong with this world .

definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .

the eu constitution is at the top , said german foreign minister steinmeier , over a year after it was shot down by french and dutch voters . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said this week in berlin at an annual meeting of the heads of german diplomatic missions that revitalizing plans for a european union constitution would be a top priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in the first half of 2007 .

more records are coming , but there 's no proof the parliamentarians spied . the remaining documents from the " rosenholz files " on former west german parliamentarians between 1969 and 1972 , kept by former east germany 's secret police , are to be released at the end of september , wrote marianne birthler in a guest article wednesday in fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g daily .
birthler is head of the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , commonly known as the " stasi . " in early august , files on 11 former parliamentarians were made available to researchers and the media .
the new information could affect as many as 40 former delegates , birthler wrote . spy status still u n clear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler holds a cd-rom version of the rosenholz files the indication " unofficial employee " appears in many of the previously released files as well as those awaiting release .
it is now known that the marking is ambiguous and could mean that the individual willingly spied for the gdr , was unknowingly siphoned for information by the stasi , or that the stasi simply kept information on them . birthler emphasized in her article that there is no proof in the new material that any of the parliamentarians mentioned there were active as spies for the former east german regime . " those who are hoping to find proof in the new documents to convict a few previously unknown stasi informers are n't going to get their money 's worth , " wrote birthler , who also stressed the academic value of the files in learning more about the relationship between the two german governments . more to gdr cooperatio n tha n spyi n g for stasi but not everything in the files is flattering . " the friendly , even affectionate tone in letters to ' dear erich " ' honecker , the former chief of the communist east german state , may be cause for embarrassment , birthler wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi bribed lawmakers the failed vote of no confidence against then chancellor willy brandt -lrb- right -rrb- in 1972 , according to files people often jump directly to assumptions of spying for the stasi when collaboration with the communist regime is brought up , said birthler , who pointed out that other aspects of the gdr are also worth taking into account . " it 's time , also in the eastern part of our country , to consider more seriously the policies of the sed , the parties of the eastern bloc and of the mass organizations , in addition to the secret service , " she said . the rosenholz documents can not be released immediately , due to a privacy law initiated by former chancellor helmut kohl .
living parliamentarians implicated in the files have the right to raise objections to their release until next week . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany releases stasi files on cold war politicians the office guarding east german secret police records has released the first set of files concerning 16 west german politicians who served between 1969 and 1972 .

the eu constitution is at the top , said german foreign minister steinmeier , over a year after it was shot down by french and dutch voters . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said this week in berlin at an annual meeting of the heads of german diplomatic missions that revitalizing plans for a european union constitution would be a top priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in the first half of 2007 .

forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do .

at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .

if women would only stop trying to be like men , pursuing their careers and trying to juggle their jobs and their kids , and become again what they were always meant to be - mothers and wives - things would get back to normal . but why did she have a career of her own ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tupperware parties become all the rage again ?
herman was born in 1958 into a family of a hotel manager .
her father died when she was six years old .
initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .
but germany could have seen it coming , judging from the conclusion of her first novel , " then came you . " " a great , warm feeling of happiness for being a woman at last ran through me , " she wrote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie 's new web site to get feminine makeover with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler .

more records are coming , but there 's no proof the parliamentarians spied . the remaining documents from the " rosenholz files " on former west german parliamentarians between 1969 and 1972 , kept by former east germany 's secret police , are to be released at the end of september , wrote marianne birthler in a guest article wednesday in fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g daily .
birthler is head of the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , commonly known as the " stasi . " in early august , files on 11 former parliamentarians were made available to researchers and the media .
the new information could affect as many as 40 former delegates , birthler wrote . spy status still u n clear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler holds a cd-rom version of the rosenholz files the indication " unofficial employee " appears in many of the previously released files as well as those awaiting release .
it is now known that the marking is ambiguous and could mean that the individual willingly spied for the gdr , was unknowingly siphoned for information by the stasi , or that the stasi simply kept information on them . birthler emphasized in her article that there is no proof in the new material that any of the parliamentarians mentioned there were active as spies for the former east german regime . " those who are hoping to find proof in the new documents to convict a few previously unknown stasi informers are n't going to get their money 's worth , " wrote birthler , who also stressed the academic value of the files in learning more about the relationship between the two german governments . more to gdr cooperatio n tha n spyi n g for stasi but not everything in the files is flattering . " the friendly , even affectionate tone in letters to ' dear erich " ' honecker , the former chief of the communist east german state , may be cause for embarrassment , birthler wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi bribed lawmakers the failed vote of no confidence against then chancellor willy brandt -lrb- right -rrb- in 1972 , according to files people often jump directly to assumptions of spying for the stasi when collaboration with the communist regime is brought up , said birthler , who pointed out that other aspects of the gdr are also worth taking into account . " it 's time , also in the eastern part of our country , to consider more seriously the policies of the sed , the parties of the eastern bloc and of the mass organizations , in addition to the secret service , " she said . the rosenholz documents can not be released immediately , due to a privacy law initiated by former chancellor helmut kohl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2006 eu commission upgrades german and eu growth forecasts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have reason to smile the european commission is raising its forecasts for economic growth this year in germany , in the 12-country euro zone and in the 25-nation eu , a new report says . brussels is softly predicting that growth for 2006 in the eu - and also in germany , europe 's largest economy - will be better than expected , according to a new report by the european commission . the commission upgraded the forecast for german growth to 2.2 percent for 2006 , up from an earlier prognosis of 1.7 percent .
it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit . " we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " said german finance minister peer steinbrück . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .

8 .
even though the book can be only pre-ordered at this point , it is already no. 13 on the list of bestsellers at the german site of the online bookseller amazon . herman 's new book is expected to cause at least as much commotion as the article entitled " emancipation - an error ? " which she wrote for the may issue of the political magazine cicero .
in it , she blamed feminism for making women frustrated and for eating away family values in germany . it should come as no surprise that herman is not very popular in feminist circles . alice schwarzer , german feminist and editor of women 's magazine emma , described herman 's article on emancipation as " gibberish between a stone age bat and mother 's cross " - referring to a nazi-era medal of honor for german women who bore more than three children . reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german feminist author alice schwarzer is not amused by eva herman even inside the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a traditional harbinger of family values on the german political scene , herman 's views have been met with puzzlement . " this image of women is unacceptable in a modern society and it does n't correspond any longer to reality , " said marita meyer-kainer , a cdu parliamentarian in hamburg . herman , however , thinks she knows what 's wrong with this world .
and she knows that the solution is a simple one .
if women would only stop trying to be like men , pursuing their careers and trying to juggle their jobs and their kids , and become again what they were always meant to be - mothers and wives - things would get back to normal . but why did she have a career of her own ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tupperware parties become all the rage again ?
herman was born in 1958 into a family of a hotel manager .
her father died when she was six years old .
initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

the eu constitution is at the top , said german foreign minister steinmeier , over a year after it was shot down by french and dutch voters . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said this week in berlin at an annual meeting of the heads of german diplomatic missions that revitalizing plans for a european union constitution would be a top priority when germany takes over the eu presidency in the first half of 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.09.2006 delighted , not desperate , housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman 's days at tagesschau are over , for the time being at least what do women really want ?
definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .
herman has spent most of her life outside the treasured realm of freudian suppression known as domestic bliss . the joy of cooking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home , sweet home despite the fact or , perhaps , because of the fact that she never became a full-time mom , herman is nowadays germany 's most vocal proponent of a pre-feminist fantasy world in which women bake cookies , fold the laundry and water the plants as the ultimate form of self-fulfillment . her new book entitled " the eva principle - for a new femininity " will be published on sept .
8 .
even though the book can be only pre-ordered at this point , it is already no. 13 on the list of bestsellers at the german site of the online bookseller amazon . herman 's new book is expected to cause at least as much commotion as the article entitled " emancipation - an error ? " which she wrote for the may issue of the political magazine cicero .
in it , she blamed feminism for making women frustrated and for eating away family values in germany . it should come as no surprise that herman is not very popular in feminist circles . alice schwarzer , german feminist and editor of women 's magazine emma , described herman 's article on emancipation as " gibberish between a stone age bat and mother 's cross " - referring to a nazi-era medal of honor for german women who bore more than three children . reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german feminist author alice schwarzer is not amused by eva herman even inside the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a traditional harbinger of family values on the german political scene , herman 's views have been met with puzzlement . " this image of women is unacceptable in a modern society and it does n't correspond any longer to reality , " said marita meyer-kainer , a cdu parliamentarian in hamburg . herman , however , thinks she knows what 's wrong with this world .
and she knows that the solution is a simple one .
if women would only stop trying to be like men , pursuing their careers and trying to juggle their jobs and their kids , and become again what they were always meant to be - mothers and wives - things would get back to normal . but why did she have a career of her own ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tupperware parties become all the rage again ?
herman was born in 1958 into a family of a hotel manager .
her father died when she was six years old .
initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .
but germany could have seen it coming , judging from the conclusion of her first novel , " then came you . " " a great , warm feeling of happiness for being a woman at last ran through me , " she wrote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie 's new web site to get feminine makeover with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler . "
but thanks to a forward-thinking young man , she 's got nothing to worry about .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 .

initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .
but germany could have seen it coming , judging from the conclusion of her first novel , " then came you . " " a great , warm feeling of happiness for being a woman at last ran through me , " she wrote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie 's new web site to get feminine makeover with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.09.2006 delighted , not desperate , housewives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva herman 's days at tagesschau are over , for the time being at least what do women really want ?
definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .
herman has spent most of her life outside the treasured realm of freudian suppression known as domestic bliss . the joy of cooking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home , sweet home despite the fact or , perhaps , because of the fact that she never became a full-time mom , herman is nowadays germany 's most vocal proponent of a pre-feminist fantasy world in which women bake cookies , fold the laundry and water the plants as the ultimate form of self-fulfillment . her new book entitled " the eva principle - for a new femininity " will be published on sept .
8 .
even though the book can be only pre-ordered at this point , it is already no. 13 on the list of bestsellers at the german site of the online bookseller amazon . herman 's new book is expected to cause at least as much commotion as the article entitled " emancipation - an error ? " which she wrote for the may issue of the political magazine cicero .
in it , she blamed feminism for making women frustrated and for eating away family values in germany . it should come as no surprise that herman is not very popular in feminist circles . alice schwarzer , german feminist and editor of women 's magazine emma , described herman 's article on emancipation as " gibberish between a stone age bat and mother 's cross " - referring to a nazi-era medal of honor for german women who bore more than three children . reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german feminist author alice schwarzer is not amused by eva herman even inside the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a traditional harbinger of family values on the german political scene , herman 's views have been met with puzzlement . " this image of women is unacceptable in a modern society and it does n't correspond any longer to reality , " said marita meyer-kainer , a cdu parliamentarian in hamburg . herman , however , thinks she knows what 's wrong with this world .
and she knows that the solution is a simple one .
if women would only stop trying to be like men , pursuing their careers and trying to juggle their jobs and their kids , and become again what they were always meant to be - mothers and wives - things would get back to normal . but why did she have a career of her own ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tupperware parties become all the rage again ?
herman was born in 1958 into a family of a hotel manager .
her father died when she was six years old .
initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .
but germany could have seen it coming , judging from the conclusion of her first novel , " then came you . " " a great , warm feeling of happiness for being a woman at last ran through me , " she wrote . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angie 's new web site to get feminine makeover with angela merkel about to be sworn in , the web site for the german chancellor is out of date , as the address only implies a male " kanzler .

definitely not a career , says a former german tv news presenter .
her controversial new book - " the eva principle " - encourages women to stay where she thinks they really belong : by the stove . " i believe , we women should shut up more often , " german tv news presenter eva herman said in a recent interview .
" why do we always have to have a say in everything ? " if anybody wishes they could turn back the hands of time , it is herman .
forget about free will .
forget about emancipation .
forget about equal rights . if she would get a chance to start all over again , she knows what she would do . " i would look for a man and let him work while i would take care of our five children , " she said . the ironic twist in the whole story is that herman - who was , according to a 2003 poll , germany 's favorite news presenter - wo n't get a chance to live her anti-feminist dream .
at the age of 47 , she has one son , is married for the fourth time and has a distinguished television career behind her . furthermore , she has written two novels and two non-fiction books - one about the advantages of breastfeeding and one on the importance of sleeping well at night .
in 2003 , she even came out with her first cd of swing classics , which she sang together with her moderator colleague bettina tietjen , singer max raabe and entertainer hape kerkeling .
herman has spent most of her life outside the treasured realm of freudian suppression known as domestic bliss . the joy of cooking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home , sweet home despite the fact or , perhaps , because of the fact that she never became a full-time mom , herman is nowadays germany 's most vocal proponent of a pre-feminist fantasy world in which women bake cookies , fold the laundry and water the plants as the ultimate form of self-fulfillment . her new book entitled " the eva principle - for a new femininity " will be published on sept .
8 .
even though the book can be only pre-ordered at this point , it is already no. 13 on the list of bestsellers at the german site of the online bookseller amazon . herman 's new book is expected to cause at least as much commotion as the article entitled " emancipation - an error ? " which she wrote for the may issue of the political magazine cicero .
in it , she blamed feminism for making women frustrated and for eating away family values in germany . it should come as no surprise that herman is not very popular in feminist circles . alice schwarzer , german feminist and editor of women 's magazine emma , described herman 's article on emancipation as " gibberish between a stone age bat and mother 's cross " - referring to a nazi-era medal of honor for german women who bore more than three children . reality check bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german feminist author alice schwarzer is not amused by eva herman even inside the conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a traditional harbinger of family values on the german political scene , herman 's views have been met with puzzlement . " this image of women is unacceptable in a modern society and it does n't correspond any longer to reality , " said marita meyer-kainer , a cdu parliamentarian in hamburg . herman , however , thinks she knows what 's wrong with this world .
and she knows that the solution is a simple one .
if women would only stop trying to be like men , pursuing their careers and trying to juggle their jobs and their kids , and become again what they were always meant to be - mothers and wives - things would get back to normal . but why did she have a career of her own ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tupperware parties become all the rage again ?
herman was born in 1958 into a family of a hotel manager .
her father died when she was six years old .
initially , she went into the hotel business herself , but eventually trained at bavarian public radio in munich to become a radio and later tv announcer . she became a news presenter of tagesschau - germany 's most important news program - in 1989 . in anticipation of the forthcoming publication and the debate it would provoke , hermann quit the tageschau news program in august in order to devote more time to her work as an author . " in view of the neutrality of the tagesschau , -lrb- herman -rrb- wants to take a break from her work here , " said kai gniffke , an editor at german public broadcaster ard , at the time .
" it 's a decision that deserves great respect . " after 17 years of presenting news professionally and objectively , herman 's vocabulary is changing .
she is trading " bilateral relations " and " political negotiations " for " warm nests " and " havens " in this " ever more ruthless world . " it is a bizarre change of rhetoric .
but germany could have seen it coming , judging from the conclusion of her first novel , " then came you .

national law determines if the decision is made by the parliamentary body or through a referendum vote . no concrete plan for changes the extent to which the existing document will be changed is under discussion . extensive changes would require the 16 countries that have already approved the document to review it again , while insufficient changes might not satisfy those states that rejected last year 's version . steinmeier said at the opening of the conference monday that europe 's relations with its neighbors to the east , energy security and diplomatic efforts in the middle east were additional priorities on germany 's 2007 presidential program . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel makes case for eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel called for a " new foundation " of the european project during a key speech to the bundestag on thursday , and said germany would work to revive the failed eu constitution .

more records are coming , but there 's no proof the parliamentarians spied . the remaining documents from the " rosenholz files " on former west german parliamentarians between 1969 and 1972 , kept by former east germany 's secret police , are to be released at the end of september , wrote marianne birthler in a guest article wednesday in fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g daily .
birthler is head of the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , commonly known as the " stasi . " in early august , files on 11 former parliamentarians were made available to researchers and the media .

it is now known that the marking is ambiguous and could mean that the individual willingly spied for the gdr , was unknowingly siphoned for information by the stasi , or that the stasi simply kept information on them . birthler emphasized in her article that there is no proof in the new material that any of the parliamentarians mentioned there were active as spies for the former east german regime . " those who are hoping to find proof in the new documents to convict a few previously unknown stasi informers are n't going to get their money 's worth , " wrote birthler , who also stressed the academic value of the files in learning more about the relationship between the two german governments . more to gdr cooperatio n tha n spyi n g for stasi but not everything in the files is flattering . " the friendly , even affectionate tone in letters to ' dear erich " ' honecker , the former chief of the communist east german state , may be cause for embarrassment , birthler wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi bribed lawmakers the failed vote of no confidence against then chancellor willy brandt -lrb- right -rrb- in 1972 , according to files people often jump directly to assumptions of spying for the stasi when collaboration with the communist regime is brought up , said birthler , who pointed out that other aspects of the gdr are also worth taking into account . " it 's time , also in the eastern part of our country , to consider more seriously the policies of the sed , the parties of the eastern bloc and of the mass organizations , in addition to the secret service , " she said . the rosenholz documents can not be released immediately , due to a privacy law initiated by former chancellor helmut kohl .

" iran 's answers have not satisfied us , " merkel said in a speech to parliament .
" the door for diplomacy will not be shut but we will not merely look on while iran breaks the rules without taking action . " merkel said doing nothing " was not an option " while iran ignored calls by the united nations and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to end its uranium enrichment program . merkel 's comments were among the strongest from a european leader since iran ignored an aug .

the meeting was postponed due to unknown reasons . mottaki termed negotiations the best option for removing western concerns over iran 's nuclear programs and rejected other channels , including the un security council , as ineffective . while the eu and the us have warned that an end to diplomacy will mean the issue is taken to the united nations for discussions on possible sanctions , this is opposed by russia and china , both veto-wielding members of the security council . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopes for an alternative to sanctions in iran stand-off iran 's confident dismissal of the un threat of action caused widespread concern in the international community wednesday , while germany maintained that sanctions were far from definite .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

more records are coming , but there 's no proof the parliamentarians spied . the remaining documents from the " rosenholz files " on former west german parliamentarians between 1969 and 1972 , kept by former east germany 's secret police , are to be released at the end of september , wrote marianne birthler in a guest article wednesday in fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g daily .
birthler is head of the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , commonly known as the " stasi . " in early august , files on 11 former parliamentarians were made available to researchers and the media .

it is now known that the marking is ambiguous and could mean that the individual willingly spied for the gdr , was unknowingly siphoned for information by the stasi , or that the stasi simply kept information on them . birthler emphasized in her article that there is no proof in the new material that any of the parliamentarians mentioned there were active as spies for the former east german regime . " those who are hoping to find proof in the new documents to convict a few previously unknown stasi informers are n't going to get their money 's worth , " wrote birthler , who also stressed the academic value of the files in learning more about the relationship between the two german governments . more to gdr cooperatio n tha n spyi n g for stasi but not everything in the files is flattering . " the friendly , even affectionate tone in letters to ' dear erich " ' honecker , the former chief of the communist east german state , may be cause for embarrassment , birthler wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi bribed lawmakers the failed vote of no confidence against then chancellor willy brandt -lrb- right -rrb- in 1972 , according to files people often jump directly to assumptions of spying for the stasi when collaboration with the communist regime is brought up , said birthler , who pointed out that other aspects of the gdr are also worth taking into account . " it 's time , also in the eastern part of our country , to consider more seriously the policies of the sed , the parties of the eastern bloc and of the mass organizations , in addition to the secret service , " she said . the rosenholz documents can not be released immediately , due to a privacy law initiated by former chancellor helmut kohl .

parents are now turning to the european court of human rights for help . at first , andre r. was fined hundreds of euros by the courts for teaching his five daughters and one son at home .
then in august , hamburg authorities threw the 44-year-old father in jail for a week until he agreed to enroll the children in public school .
he did n't . and when officials began escorting the children to school daily and threatening to take custody of them , the family fled to austria . armin eckermann , a lawyer who runs an organization called schulunterricht zu hause that legally represents andre r.and other familes who want to homeschool , says that this is not a unique case in germany - currently there are about 40 families fighting authorities for the right to teach their children at home . meanwhile , some parents , such as andre r. , opt to emigrate to countries where the laws around homeschooling are less strict , such as switzerland , denmark or canada .
they are hoping that a case pending before the european court of human rights in strasbourg will be decided in their favor . " it 's a scandal , really , " said eckermann .
" parents have the right to decide how to educate their children but here in germany the state decides .
so many just leave or face jail . " too restrictive eckermann and other proponents of homeschooling say that german law is too restrictive on parents .
unlike in some other european countries , german law requires that all school-age children physically attend a school that has been certified by education authorities . " the state has a duty to ensure that children receive an education , " hamburg cdu lawmaker robert heinemann told the newspaper hamburger abendblatt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the twelve tribes won a school of their own temporarily as a result , andre r. 's family has faced a battle that has stretched over years to win the right to educate their children at home in accordance with their religious beliefs - the family members are evangelical christians who believe that public schools provide insufficient religious instruction and are a bad moral influence . the fight began after they removed their 10-year-old daughter from private school in 2001 .
a series of court battles followed with higher courts ruling that the children are " isolated " at home , that homeschooling hurts children and social integration and that it is simply illegal under german law . " the courts are afraid that allowing such schooling creates a parallel society , " said eckermann .
" but we already have a parallel society . " european test case as a result , homeschool advocates are turning to the european court of human rights , arguing that german law violates the european human rights charter . " under european law , parents have the right to educate their children according to their faith , " said roger kiska , an attorney with the strasbourg-based european centre for law and justice which is assisting german parents such as andre r. in their legal claims .
" we believe that germany is violating these conventions . " the test case , which represents a number of german families , is expected to be heard by the court shortly .
any ruling the court makes is applicable in germany . partial victories homeschooling is well established in anglophone nations - about two million children are taught at home in the us annually , according to the us census bureau .
even though that number is much lower in europe , most european countries , with the exception of slovakia and germany , allow homeschooling in some form , usually with regular checks by education authorities that the children are learning what the state requires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights is to consider the issue the movement is also quite organized with numerous associations around the world offering advice , education materials and courses .
some parents , such as andre r. , have even gone so far as to get universities degrees in teaching and education . in germany , there have been partial victories for such parents .
a group of fundamentalist christian parents in bavaria recently won the right to have their children taught by their own teachers in a private school subject to state oversight . that helped end a standoff between the religious group called the twelve tribes who do n't want sex education and evolution taught to their children .
but the truce is temporary - the school is on a one-year trial . greater flexibility needed homeschool advocates say that there are at least 200 families in germany teaching their children at home , mostly in rural areas where officials sometimes turn a blind eye .
besides citing religious reasons , some parents say their children do not receive an adequate education in german schools . education expert andreas schleicher of the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- said that germany is not going far enough in " fundamentally changing " its education system , which includes better quality control and greater flexibility . " homeschooling is a tough issue , " he said .
" on one hand , parents have a legitimate interest in wanting diverse educational options .
but on the other side , the government is interested in ensuring quality standards are maintained .
certainly , germany needs to consider more flexibility . " other german education experts say they believe homeschooling will find a place in germany in the future . " what i could imagine is for homeschooling to be allowed within narrow parameters , with students being frequently tested by authorities , " said heinz-peter meidinger , head of the deutsche philologenverband , an association of german high school teachers .
" what i would not welcome is when such students are the rule and not the exception .

" following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit .

" play straight , undergo a dna test and tell all , " said bach , germany 's highest sports official , in an interview with sport bild magazine . a former tour de france and olympic champion , ullrich has refused to take a dna test to clear his name from the doping affair implicating him . " i do n't have to prove my innocence , " he said .
" i am a professional cyclist and not a killer or a criminal . " life-long cycling ban possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich was already found guilty of doping once in 2002 ullrich - along with 50 other riders - is alleged to have been given epo , steroids and human growth hormones by madrid-based sports doctor , eufemiano fuentes , the alleged head of a blood-doping network .
ullrich has denied all allegations and said he does not know fuentes . ullrich was suspended shortly before the 2006 tour by his t-mobile team and was later dismissed .
he faces a lifetime ban from cycling as a second-time offender under the rules of the world anti-doping code . the 32-year-old rider has refused to comment in detail on the allegations , but told the swiss tabloid blick in late july he had never doped . repeating the rumor does n't make it true bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich won the tour de france in 1997 " as you know i 've made a conscious decision not to comment on the many inaccurate reports in detail , " ullrich said .
" otherwise , i 'd spend the whole day correcting facts . " he said that when he had read a report recently that the affair concerning the spanish doctor had spread to hamburg and his name was mentioned in connection with this " i can only shake my head . " ullrich added that " a rumor does not become truer when printed once and then permanently repeated . " public broadcaster under fire for paying ullrich meanwhile german public broadcaster ard has defended making payments to ullrich in exchange for several years for interviews and appearing at special events .

it has also increased its forecast for the euro-zone economies this year to 2.5 percent from 2.1 percent and for the 25-nation eu to 2.7 percent from 2.3 percent . the reason for the upgrade was stronger-than-expected growth in the first six months of this year , eu sources told the german newspaper ha n delsblatt . the eu 's statistical agency eurostat has also signaled stronger growth across the bloc , with second quarter growth in 2006 expected to be 0.9 per cent higher than during the same period last year .
eurostat said first quarter 2006 growth stood at 0.8 per cent . private and public economists were caught off guard by the euro zone 's surprisingly strong growth in the first half of the year - the fastest rate in five years , which is expected to underpin strong performance for the whole of 2006 . " one has to go back a long time to see such good quarterly growth figures , " an eu official told german news agency dpa . taki n g the pulse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup helped fuel growth in germany eu finance ministers are to take the pulse of their combined 25-nation economy when they meet friday , with a growing number are worried that growth has passed its prime , officials said . " following surprisingly strong gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- growth in the first half of 2006 , the euro-zone economy looks set to return to a less exuberant pace of growth , " holger schmieding , an economist for bank of america , told afp . meeting in helsinki for two days of talks also attended by european central bank governors , the ministers are also likely to voice concerns about the impact of higher interest rates on growth . given the strong growth in the euro zone , the european central bank has steadily raised its interest rates since december to keep inflation in check , judging that bloc 's economy is strong enough to cope with higher borrowing costs . but because headline inflation has been driven up almost exclusively by high oil prices , some economists and finance ministers do not share the ecb 's view that higher interest rates are needed to keep inflation down and fear they will hold back investment and consumption and boost the euro . germa n s optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück announced that germany met the eu deficit ceiling the ministers will also have a chance to chew over new forecasts from the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- which said on tuesday that the bloc would see growth this year of 2.7 percent after benefiting in the second quarter from a one-time effect from the soccer world cup , spending in the german construction sector and falling unemployment . ministers are expected to also discuss how volatile oil prices , a cool-down in the us economy and germany 's 3 percent rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- to 19 percent could prevent a rapid eu economic recovery . but the news from berlin make people optimistic : due to higher than expected tax revenue , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of just 2.8 per cent this year , below the euro zone 's 3 per cent of gdp budget deficit limit .

spiralfrog is discussing possible deals with other big record firms , questions still remain over how the artists will be paid .

the 39-year-old princess gave birth by a caesarean section two weeks early , after complications in the pregnancy .
princess kiko , wife of the current emperor 's second son , already has two daughters , but women are not allowed to ascend to the chrysanthemum throne .
her son becomes the first male heir to be born into japan 's royal family in more than four decades .
the present heir , crown prince naruhito , and his wife , princess masako , have a young daughter , while princess sayako is married to a commoner , so if she were to have children they could not be considered .
coverage princess kiko 's son was born weighing 2,558 grams -lrb- 5lbs 10oz -rrb- at 0827 local time -lrb- 2327 gmt tuesday -rrb- .
succession pressures currently only males can ascend the japanese throne emperor akihito has two sons , naruhito and akishino if naruhito died without a male heir , akishino succeeds his baby son , so far unnamed , becomes third in line princess sayako married a commoner so her children can not ascend throne in pictures : japan welcomes birth reports say mother and child are both in good condition .
the pregnancy has attracted enormous interest in japan .
princess kiko has been in hospital since 16 august because of symptoms of partial placenta previa , a condition in which part of the placenta drops too low in the uterus .
doctors said when she went into hospital that the move was precautionary and the pregnancy was proceeding well .
" i am very glad that the prince was born , " said chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe , who is likely to become japan 's next prime minister .
" i truly feel relieved and happy to receive a report that both the princess and the prince are fine .
princess kiko and prince akishino already have two daughters " it 's a refreshing feeling that reminds us of a clear autumn sky . "
conservatives had hoped princess kiko would give birth to a boy , thereby bringing an end to debate on whether the constitution should be revised to allow women to ascend to the throne .
prime minister junichiro koizumi had been advocating such a reform , and there appeared to be support for it amongst the japanese public .
but the reform plans were shelved , amid strong opposition from conservative palace officials and some politicians , when the royal pregnancy was announced .
" reforming the imperial household law is an important issue that concerns the stability of the imperial family , " said shinzo abe .
" we must carry on the debate in a careful and calm manner . "
japan 's birth rate has continued to decline in recent years and the government has been working on ways of persuading women to have more children .
baby and maternity product companies are also hoping the birth will benefit them .
shares in baby-linked firms rose ahead of the birth , with one baby food company 's shares hitting a high for the year on monday , the associated press news agency reported .

this page is now closed .
thank you for your emails .
the comments published on this page reflect the balance of views we received .
superb documentary , nobody does it better than the beeb .
the us is a great country but they sure get a lot of things badly wrong when subjected to closer scrutiny .
willie mclanachan , strathaven well done bbc for showing another very moving programme .
the pictures showing the effects of katrina took me back to that time , the chaos and the pleas of ordinary people for help .
the people of new orleans thought they had been abandoned .
this programme proved how right they were .
judy rogers , edinburgh truly amazing documentary ... superb !
was this really the us we were watching here ?
what kind of " superpower " would treat its people in that way ?
andy , hamilton i have never been so affected by a documentary .
god bless america -lrb- you need it -rrb- .
matthew gordon , wolverhampton congratulations on a well made documentary showing a side of the us we do n't often see .
documentaries that put human faces to a disaster are always thought-provoking .
alison head , leighton buzzard prisoners of katrina was brilliant .
so very informative and interesting .
keep up the good work .
people need to hear these stories .
peter b , n ireland thank you so much for this evening 's documentary .
it provided a valuable insight into the situation in the new orleans prison system .
it has exposed the judicial system for what it really is , and the huge mistakes that have been accepted as the norm .
this programme is the first piece of intellectual viewing i have seen for a long time and is surely a far cry from reality tv shows .
please continue to show quality programmes such as this , which has prompted me to contact a broadcaster for the first time .
sybil john , woolwich that was the most interesting documentary i 've ever seen .
i ca n't get over what i just watched .
well done - i 'm sure you have changed thousands of peoples ' views on the legal system .
callum , sheffield having just watched prisoners of katrina i am horrified to see the way in which these men have been treated .
surely the president of the us can intervene on their behalf .
if he does n't , then he should be ashamed of himself .
the government could , and should , help these men .
peggy gadsby , cornwall what is the matter with you people ?
yet another programme ruined by intrusive " background " music .
why this obsession with constant sawing cellos , which overpower the narration and contributors ' comments ?
let the pictures and narrative speak for themselves ... we do n't need this patronising and superfluous mood prompting .
jonathan baddiel , manchester i know they had no contingency plans for flooding , but they showed total ignorance when the flooding actually came .
katrina destroyed the justice system -lrb- which was already in tatters -rrb- in a few hours .
now many innocent people are in jail .
i hope they will learn lessons from this .
sagat , leeds an excellent programme .
every single american should hang their head in shame .
they are quick enough to protest about injustice and violence in third world countries , but they are far worse as they are supposed to be civilised .
sue taylor , cheltenham although i felt something for the plight of the prisoners , new orleans did not even have a plan for the ordinary people of the city .
vulnerable groups like women and children , the sick , the elderly all suffered the same fate .
surely they should come first .
melanie peterson , hull this programme was one of the best i 've seen for a long time .
it 's really depressing to hear what you already suspected being confirmed .
i 'm so , so glad that the bbc exists and continues to broadcast this stuff .
treble the licence fee and it would still be a bargain .
winston , wales i think this is despicable and i am truly disgusted by what i just watched .
i never realised that a superpower such as the us could be so disorganised .
matthew rodwell , bristol an excellent programme .
i only hope it will be broadcast here in the us .
it amazes me that sheriff gusman was re-elected .
pamela stine , us the land of the free ?
the land of extremes would be a better label .
nick brown , guildford the kind of journalism that makes us all want to be great journalists .
an amazing story , told so well and a subject so worth covering .
the sort of thing that the bbc should strive for , time and time again .
brilliant , fascinating , shocking , well-researched , thought-provoking - and - not a bad thing this : entertaining .
james wallman , london are the prisoners that were locked up for longer than they were supposed to be , or locked up without charge , able to sue the government ?
is anyone able to help them ?
seems like someone should .
richard hoyes , southampton just curious ... you list some great shows on bbc 2 like the stories on katrina .
why ca n't we get that type of quality broadcast here in the states on bbc america rather then endless home improvement shows or benny hill re-runs ?

keep up the good work .
people need to hear these stories .
peter b , n ireland thank you so much for this evening 's documentary .
it provided a valuable insight into the situation in the new orleans prison system .
it has exposed the judicial system for what it really is , and the huge mistakes that have been accepted as the norm .
this programme is the first piece of intellectual viewing i have seen for a long time and is surely a far cry from reality tv shows .
please continue to show quality programmes such as this , which has prompted me to contact a broadcaster for the first time .
sybil john , woolwich that was the most interesting documentary i 've ever seen .
i ca n't get over what i just watched .
well done - i 'm sure you have changed thousands of peoples ' views on the legal system .
callum , sheffield having just watched prisoners of katrina i am horrified to see the way in which these men have been treated .
surely the president of the us can intervene on their behalf .
if he does n't , then he should be ashamed of himself .
the government could , and should , help these men .
peggy gadsby , cornwall what is the matter with you people ?
yet another programme ruined by intrusive " background " music .
why this obsession with constant sawing cellos , which overpower the narration and contributors ' comments ?
let the pictures and narrative speak for themselves ... we do n't need this patronising and superfluous mood prompting .
jonathan baddiel , manchester i know they had no contingency plans for flooding , but they showed total ignorance when the flooding actually came .
katrina destroyed the justice system -lrb- which was already in tatters -rrb- in a few hours .
now many innocent people are in jail .
i hope they will learn lessons from this .
sagat , leeds an excellent programme .
every single american should hang their head in shame .
they are quick enough to protest about injustice and violence in third world countries , but they are far worse as they are supposed to be civilised .
sue taylor , cheltenham although i felt something for the plight of the prisoners , new orleans did not even have a plan for the ordinary people of the city .
vulnerable groups like women and children , the sick , the elderly all suffered the same fate .
surely they should come first .
melanie peterson , hull this programme was one of the best i 've seen for a long time .
it 's really depressing to hear what you already suspected being confirmed .
i 'm so , so glad that the bbc exists and continues to broadcast this stuff .
treble the licence fee and it would still be a bargain .
winston , wales i think this is despicable and i am truly disgusted by what i just watched .
i never realised that a superpower such as the us could be so disorganised .
matthew rodwell , bristol an excellent programme .
i only hope it will be broadcast here in the us .
it amazes me that sheriff gusman was re-elected .
pamela stine , us the land of the free ?
the land of extremes would be a better label .
nick brown , guildford the kind of journalism that makes us all want to be great journalists .
an amazing story , told so well and a subject so worth covering .
the sort of thing that the bbc should strive for , time and time again .
brilliant , fascinating , shocking , well-researched , thought-provoking - and - not a bad thing this : entertaining .
james wallman , london are the prisoners that were locked up for longer than they were supposed to be , or locked up without charge , able to sue the government ?
is anyone able to help them ?
seems like someone should .
richard hoyes , southampton just curious ... you list some great shows on bbc 2 like the stories on katrina .
why ca n't we get that type of quality broadcast here in the states on bbc america rather then endless home improvement shows or benny hill re-runs ?

keep up the good work .
people need to hear these stories .
peter b , n ireland thank you so much for this evening 's documentary .
it provided a valuable insight into the situation in the new orleans prison system .
it has exposed the judicial system for what it really is , and the huge mistakes that have been accepted as the norm .
this programme is the first piece of intellectual viewing i have seen for a long time and is surely a far cry from reality tv shows .
please continue to show quality programmes such as this , which has prompted me to contact a broadcaster for the first time .
sybil john , woolwich that was the most interesting documentary i 've ever seen .
i ca n't get over what i just watched .
well done - i 'm sure you have changed thousands of peoples ' views on the legal system .
callum , sheffield having just watched prisoners of katrina i am horrified to see the way in which these men have been treated .
surely the president of the us can intervene on their behalf .
if he does n't , then he should be ashamed of himself .
the government could , and should , help these men .
peggy gadsby , cornwall what is the matter with you people ?
yet another programme ruined by intrusive " background " music .
why this obsession with constant sawing cellos , which overpower the narration and contributors ' comments ?
let the pictures and narrative speak for themselves ... we do n't need this patronising and superfluous mood prompting .
jonathan baddiel , manchester i know they had no contingency plans for flooding , but they showed total ignorance when the flooding actually came .
katrina destroyed the justice system -lrb- which was already in tatters -rrb- in a few hours .
now many innocent people are in jail .
i hope they will learn lessons from this .
sagat , leeds an excellent programme .
every single american should hang their head in shame .
they are quick enough to protest about injustice and violence in third world countries , but they are far worse as they are supposed to be civilised .
sue taylor , cheltenham although i felt something for the plight of the prisoners , new orleans did not even have a plan for the ordinary people of the city .
vulnerable groups like women and children , the sick , the elderly all suffered the same fate .
surely they should come first .
melanie peterson , hull this programme was one of the best i 've seen for a long time .
it 's really depressing to hear what you already suspected being confirmed .
i 'm so , so glad that the bbc exists and continues to broadcast this stuff .
treble the licence fee and it would still be a bargain .
winston , wales i think this is despicable and i am truly disgusted by what i just watched .
i never realised that a superpower such as the us could be so disorganised .
matthew rodwell , bristol an excellent programme .
i only hope it will be broadcast here in the us .
it amazes me that sheriff gusman was re-elected .
pamela stine , us the land of the free ?
the land of extremes would be a better label .
nick brown , guildford the kind of journalism that makes us all want to be great journalists .
an amazing story , told so well and a subject so worth covering .
the sort of thing that the bbc should strive for , time and time again .
brilliant , fascinating , shocking , well-researched , thought-provoking - and - not a bad thing this : entertaining .
james wallman , london are the prisoners that were locked up for longer than they were supposed to be , or locked up without charge , able to sue the government ?
is anyone able to help them ?
seems like someone should .
richard hoyes , southampton just curious ... you list some great shows on bbc 2 like the stories on katrina .
why ca n't we get that type of quality broadcast here in the states on bbc america rather then endless home improvement shows or benny hill re-runs ?

like-for-like sales at its currys stores , which include rebranded dixons outlets , rose 8 % in the 16 weeks to 19 august against a 3 % drop last year .
overall like-for-like sales - which strip out the effect of new stores - rose 5 % after falling 1 % in 2005 .
strong demand for flat screen tvs and laptops had helped drive sales across europe , the group added .
it also said a recovery in demand in the uk for white goods , such as washing machines and freezers , had also lifted sales .
' good start ' " overall the group has performed well in most of our markets during the first 16 weeks of this financial year , " said chief executive john clare .
" i am encouraged by the good start to this financial year and believe that this year 's pipeline of digital products will continue to capture the imagination of our customers . "
in april , dsg announced it was shaking up its business in the uk in an effort to cut costs .
under the plans , dixons became an online retail operation with its 190 outlets rebranded as currys.digital along with branches of currys .
the move , which is thought to have cost £ 7m , is expected to save dsg £ 3m a year .
dixon 's internet sales have racked up growth of 50 % each year during the last four years , and it now gets over 1 million visitors per month .
but looking ahead , mr clare said it was too early to draw any firm conclusions for the year ahead as the first quarter of the financial year was a traditionally quiet time for the group .
dsg operates 1,450 stores in 14 countries including the uk , norway , sweden , greece , italy , spain , france , czech republic , poland and finland .
as well as pc world and the link in the uk , the group owns elkjop in the nordic countries , and unieuro in italy .

for many , the answer lay on the internet - where fans have taken on the task of continuing the show in dozens of different productions .
the most prominent of these " fan films " is star trek : hidden frontier , which has so far produced 46 episodes over seven seasons .
filmed entirely by volunteers , it draws on characters and events from the official series - but has gained notoriety for its controversial storylines .
the programme is set in the briar patch , a chaotic area of space introduced in the ninth star trek movie , insurrection , and has a cast of almost 50 actors - all working for free .
early days hidden frontier was created by rob caves , who also acts as cameraman , boom operator , scriptwriter , animator and editor on the show .
" it started back in 2000 , " he recalls .
" i was at film school at loyola marymount university in los angeles and i met some other star trek fans that wanted to start up a project .
" we had a star trek club in the area that wanted to help out and we got some actors from that .
" los angeles is very well known for actors wanting to get their break , so we also got a lot of people who would work for free . "
with cast and crew assembled , the team began the process of filming their first episodes .
but a limited budget meant they could not afford the expensive sets and locations of a real television series . "
we decided pretty early on that ... we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done " rob caves creator , hidden frontier the solution was to shoot everything against a green screen in a garage , with the backgrounds added later using computer graphics .
actress risha denney , who plays capt elizabeth shelby on the show , remembers the early shoots as being " a lot smaller , a lot more cramped and a lot more difficult " than they are today .
" even though we 've got more technical - with longer shoots , more language and more props - it 's got a lot easier because we know each other and we 're set in out ways now . "
daring storylines the team 's growing confidence has also allowed them to tackle controversial issues in the programme .
most notably , they introduced an openly gay character , lt corey aster , in the second season of the programme .
played by jt tepnapa , who is also one of the show 's co-producers , lt aster was the first star trek character to have a gay kiss on screen .
" we decided pretty early on that , because we were doing a show that did n't have any direct studio connections , we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done , " says caves .
" one of our actors had clinical depression and so there was a story written about that . "
everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer " rob caves creator , hidden frontiers " we told stories that had gay characters , or you had commentary on 9/11 . "
the episode discussing the repercussions of september 11 2001 featured a star trek security council implementing new anti-terror laws .
" that was kind of a way to talk about some of the things that i guess we are concerned with in our day and age - about how to protect us from terrorism without losing freedom , " says caves .
" the science fiction setting is perfect for telling stories without hitting people over the head with them . "
fanbase it takes between four and six weeks to make one episode of hidden frontier , and new programmes are released on the show 's website as soon as they are finished .
around 50,000 episodes are downloaded for free every month , and more than 2,000 people regularly contribute to the website 's forum pages .
risha denney says she has even been recognised for her role in the programme .
" i 've not had anyone walk up to me , " she says , " but some people realise after 20 to 30 minutes of conversation that they 've seen me on internet " .
denney says the series has also acted as a calling-card for hollywood .
" some of more well-liked characters ended up leaving because they got parts elsewhere . "
" and if i was still pursuing acting actively it would help me a lot . "
caves says the programme has helped him make contacts in the film industry , and he has met several producers " to discuss projects to do when hidden frontier is over " .
however , he says he has no plans to abandon the series just yet .
" hollywood is very much set up so you 'll be working for a while then you wo n't be working , so it 's good practice to be doing something regularly . "
indeed , caves would encourage other people to make their own tribute films .
" everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer , " he says .
" it 's not break-the-bank kind of expensive , but if you 're going to start up a fan film you do need a few thousand dollars to get started .
" but for fans of the show it 's an incredible thing to be able to play in the sandbox . "

" and if i was still pursuing acting actively it would help me a lot . "
there are about 50 actors in the cast of hidden frontier caves says the programme has helped him make contacts in the film industry , and he has met several producers " to discuss projects to do when hidden frontier is over " .
however , he says he has no plans to abandon the series just yet .
" hollywood is very much set up so you 'll be working for a while then you wo n't be working , so it 's good practice to be doing something regularly . "
indeed , caves would encourage other people to make their own tribute films .
" everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer , " he says .
" it 's not break-the-bank kind of expensive , but if you 're going to start up a fan film you do need a few thousand dollars to get started .
" but for fans of the show it 's an incredible thing to be able to play in the sandbox . "

for many , the answer lay on the internet - where fans have taken on the task of continuing the show in dozens of different productions .
the most prominent of these " fan films " is star trek : hidden frontier , which has so far produced 46 episodes over seven seasons .
filmed entirely by volunteers , it draws on characters and events from the official series - but has gained notoriety for its controversial storylines .
the programme is set in the briar patch , a chaotic area of space introduced in the ninth star trek movie , insurrection , and has a cast of almost 50 actors - all working for free .
early days hidden frontier was created by rob caves , who also acts as cameraman , boom operator , scriptwriter , animator and editor on the show .
" it started back in 2000 , " he recalls .
" i was at film school at loyola marymount university in los angeles and i met some other star trek fans that wanted to start up a project .
all of the backgrounds are created on computer after filming " we had a star trek club in the area that wanted to help out and we got some actors from that .
" los angeles is very well known for actors wanting to get their break , so we also got a lot of people who would work for free . "
with cast and crew assembled , the team began the process of filming their first episodes .
but a limited budget meant they could not afford the expensive sets and locations of a real television series .
we decided pretty early on that ... we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done rob caves creator , hidden frontier the solution was to shoot everything against a green screen in a garage , with the backgrounds added later using computer graphics .
actress risha denney , who plays capt elizabeth shelby on the show , remembers the early shoots as being " a lot smaller , a lot more cramped and a lot more difficult " than they are today .
" even though we 've got more technical - with longer shoots , more language and more props - it 's got a lot easier because we know each other and we 're set in out ways now . "
daring storylines the team 's growing confidence has also allowed them to tackle controversial issues in the programme .
hidden frontier portrayed the first gay kiss in star trek history most notably , they introduced an openly gay character , lt corey aster , in the second season of the programme .
played by jt tepnapa , who is also one of the show 's co-producers , lt aster was the first star trek character to have a gay kiss on screen .
" we decided pretty early on that , because we were doing a show that did n't have any direct studio connections , we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done , " says caves .
" one of our actors had clinical depression and so there was a story written about that .
everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer rob caves creator , hidden frontiers " we told stories that had gay characters , or you had commentary on 9/11 . "
the episode discussing the repercussions of september 11 2001 featured a star trek security council implementing new anti-terror laws .
" that was kind of a way to talk about some of the things that i guess we are concerned with in our day and age - about how to protect us from terrorism without losing freedom , " says caves .
" the science fiction setting is perfect for telling stories without hitting people over the head with them . "
fanbase risha denney plays capt elizabeth shelby on the show it takes between four and six weeks to make one episode of hidden frontier , and new programmes are released on the show 's website as soon as they are finished .
around 50,000 episodes are downloaded for free every month , and more than 2,000 people regularly contribute to the website 's forum pages .
risha denney says she has even been recognised for her role in the programme .
" i 've not had anyone walk up to me , " she says , " but some people realise after 20 to 30 minutes of conversation that they 've seen me on internet " .

early days hidden frontier was created by rob caves , who also acts as cameraman , boom operator , scriptwriter , animator and editor on the show .
" it started back in 2000 , " he recalls .
" i was at film school at loyola marymount university in los angeles and i met some other star trek fans that wanted to start up a project .
all of the backgrounds are created on computer after filming " we had a star trek club in the area that wanted to help out and we got some actors from that .
" los angeles is very well known for actors wanting to get their break , so we also got a lot of people who would work for free . "
with cast and crew assembled , the team began the process of filming their first episodes .
but a limited budget meant they could not afford the expensive sets and locations of a real television series .
we decided pretty early on that ... we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done rob caves creator , hidden frontier the solution was to shoot everything against a green screen in a garage , with the backgrounds added later using computer graphics .
actress risha denney , who plays capt elizabeth shelby on the show , remembers the early shoots as being " a lot smaller , a lot more cramped and a lot more difficult " than they are today .
" even though we 've got more technical - with longer shoots , more language and more props - it 's got a lot easier because we know each other and we 're set in out ways now . "
daring storylines the team 's growing confidence has also allowed them to tackle controversial issues in the programme .
hidden frontier portrayed the first gay kiss in star trek history most notably , they introduced an openly gay character , lt corey aster , in the second season of the programme .
played by jt tepnapa , who is also one of the show 's co-producers , lt aster was the first star trek character to have a gay kiss on screen .
" we decided pretty early on that , because we were doing a show that did n't have any direct studio connections , we 'd try and do things that star trek had n't done , " says caves .
" one of our actors had clinical depression and so there was a story written about that .
everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer rob caves creator , hidden frontiers " we told stories that had gay characters , or you had commentary on 9/11 . "
the episode discussing the repercussions of september 11 2001 featured a star trek security council implementing new anti-terror laws .
" that was kind of a way to talk about some of the things that i guess we are concerned with in our day and age - about how to protect us from terrorism without losing freedom , " says caves .
" the science fiction setting is perfect for telling stories without hitting people over the head with them . "
fanbase risha denney plays capt elizabeth shelby on the show it takes between four and six weeks to make one episode of hidden frontier , and new programmes are released on the show 's website as soon as they are finished .
around 50,000 episodes are downloaded for free every month , and more than 2,000 people regularly contribute to the website 's forum pages .
risha denney says she has even been recognised for her role in the programme .
" i 've not had anyone walk up to me , " she says , " but some people realise after 20 to 30 minutes of conversation that they 've seen me on internet " .
denney says the series has also acted as a calling-card for hollywood .
" some of more well-liked characters ended up leaving because they got parts elsewhere . "
" and if i was still pursuing acting actively it would help me a lot . "
there are about 50 actors in the cast of hidden frontier caves says the programme has helped him make contacts in the film industry , and he has met several producers " to discuss projects to do when hidden frontier is over " .
however , he says he has no plans to abandon the series just yet .
" hollywood is very much set up so you 'll be working for a while then you wo n't be working , so it 's good practice to be doing something regularly . "
indeed , caves would encourage other people to make their own tribute films .
" everything you need to do on a fan film now you can do on a home computer , " he says .
" it 's not break-the-bank kind of expensive , but if you 're going to start up a fan film you do need a few thousand dollars to get started .
" but for fans of the show it 's an incredible thing to be able to play in the sandbox . "

dr paul nunn , from the who , said a failure to correctly implement treatment strategies was to blame .
tb experts have convened in johannesburg , south africa , to discuss how to address the problem .
tb presently causes about 1.7 million deaths a year worldwide , but researchers are worried about the emergence of strains that are resistant to drugs .
this is very worrying , especially when mixed with hiv dr paul nunn , who drug resistance is caused by poor tb control , through taking the wrong types of drugs for the incorrect duration .
multi-drug resistant tb -lrb- mdr tb -rrb- , which describes strains of tb that are resistant to at least two of the main first-line tb drugs , is already a growing concern .
globally , the who estimates there are about 425,000 cases of mdr tb a year , mostly occurring in the former soviet union , china and india .
treatment requires the use of second-line drugs , which are more toxic , take longer to work and costly .

a recent survey of 18,000 tb samples by the us-based centers for disease control and the who between november 2004 and november 2005 found 20 % of them were multi-drug resistant and a further 2 % were extreme drug resistant .
further detailed analysis of several countries found the prevalence was even higher .
in the us , 4 % of all mdr tb cases met the criteria for xdr tb ; in south korea , the figure was 15 % .
in latvia , and according to dr nunn other areas of the baltics and the former soviet union , 19 % of all multi-drug resistant cases were extreme drug resistant too .

of these , 52 died within 25 days , and 44 of the 53 had been tested for hiv and were all found to be hiv positive .
he said xdr tb could have a bigger impact on developing nations , including africa , because of the prevalence of hiv .
dr dunn said : " this is very worrying , especially when mixed with hiv .
" we need to make sure we do the basics properly , in other words , ensuring , and where necessary , supervising that the patient takes every pill for the course of the treatment .

he added that it was key that new drugs were developed in future .
he said work was underway looking at new drugs , including research into tb vaccines .

new laws will make it illegal for a parent / guardian to hit a child only if it results in lasting harm or marks .
commissioner barney mcneany said the government was failing in its duties to promote and protect children 's rights .
however , mary russell from the family education trust said the decision should be left to parents .
" we are in fact talking about rearing and disciplining children , " she said .
" in that realm , i am afraid that the offices of the children 's commissioner are no more experienced , no wiser and no better at it than the next man .
" their opinions on it must remain exactly that , opinions .
they must never be brought in as legislation . "
the commissioner 's legal move is being supported by a number of charities and organisations .
the legislation is already in force in england and wales .
mr mcneaney said he believed the legislation would effectively mean children could continue to be assaulted by their parents .
his office has lodged papers with the high court , and a judge will decide whether to grant permission for a judicial review at a hearing next tuesday .
the children 's law centre , save the children and the parents advice centre have issued a joint statement welcoming the legal action .
the organisations said children were entitled to be protected from any form of violence on an equal footing with adults .

new laws will make it illegal for a parent / guardian to hit a child only if it results in lasting harm or marks .
commissioner barney mcneany said the government was failing in its duties to promote and protect children 's rights .
however , mary russell from the family education trust said the decision should be left to parents .
" we are in fact talking about rearing and disciplining children , " she said .
" in that realm , i am afraid that the offices of the children 's commissioner are no more experienced , no wiser and no better at it than the next man .
" their opinions on it must remain exactly that , opinions .
they must never be brought in as legislation . "
the commissioner 's legal move is being supported by a number of charities and organisations .
the legislation is already in force in england and wales .
mr mcneaney said he believed the legislation would effectively mean children could continue to be assaulted by their parents .
his office has lodged papers with the high court , and a judge will decide whether to grant permission for a judicial review at a hearing next tuesday .
the children 's law centre , save the children and the parents advice centre have issued a joint statement welcoming the legal action .
the organisations said children were entitled to be protected from any form of violence on an equal footing with adults .

couric became one of the figureheads of us news broadcasting during her time with nbc , where she interviewed us presidents bill clinton and george bush .
but she has drawn criticism for what some see as blurring the line between news and entertainment .
the news presenter has featured in films such as shark tale and goldmember , as well as presenting the tonight show - a role usually taken by comedian jay leno .
the bbc 's jeremy cooke , in new york , says couric 's appointment marks the end of a totally male dominated era .
generations of americans have grown up receiving their news from white middle class men , from walter cronkite to peter jennings , tom brokaw and dan rather .
amid falling ratings , cbs has made a multi-million dollar gamble that katie couric can reverse the network 's fortunes , our correspondent adds .
but given the fact that so many americans now receive their news from alternative sources , it will be an uphill task , even for katie couric , e-mail this to a friend printable version see also us news legend rather leaves cbs 20 jun 06 -pipe- entertainment couric to become sole news anchor 05 apr 06 -pipe- entertainment waking up with katie couric 14 dec 01 -pipe- newsmakers related internet links cbs news nbc today show the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top entertainment stories u2 reschedule us and canada dates cheryl ' on the mend ' says simon cowell zsa zsa gabor taken to hospital most popular stories now most shared most read the battle for berlin 's gardens your news , your pictures enola gay navigator has ' no regrets ' in pictures : finnish pursuits most popular now , in detail most shared most read world sauna event finalist dies robbie williams ' marries in la ' north korea ' holds southern boat ' duchess tries to avoid bankruptcy dozens killed in china landslides the battle for berlin 's gardens tributes paid to killed uk doctor no 10 rejects child milk cut idea in pictures : finnish pursuits rain adds to pakistan flood woes most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis planning an exit attacks by afghan soldiers pose nato problems sanction evasion ?

on many routes there will be no trains and only one in five is likely to run overall if the row is not resolved .
emergency timetables were handed out earlier to commuters who are urged to avoid rush hour travel if possible .
tens of thousands of people take swt services into london 's waterloo station during weekday rush hours .
make alternative travel arrangements on these days if you possibly can james burt talks on tuesday failed to resolve the row over managers being used to drive trains during a previous strike .
services that run during the walkouts on friday and monday will begin and end earlier than usual .
" we therefore advise you to avoid the peak hours and to make alternative travel arrangements on these days if you possibly can , " said swt operations director james burt .
swt usually runs 1,700 trains every weekday between waterloo and the south west and south east , including bristol , plymouth , reading , weymouth and brighton .
' strike breaking ' row the dispute began as a row over taxis being provided for drivers facing late-night or early-morning shifts but escalated after swt used managers to operate trains during walkouts .
drivers ' union aslef claimed safety was compromised , a charge strongly denied by the company .
an swt spokesman said : " what the union sees as strike breaking , we see as customer service . "
an aslef spokesman said the union had put forward proposals that could resolve the dispute .
but an official said it was a " pretty sure bet " that the strikes will go ahead as planned .

the division , which owns rights to artists including coldplay , robbie williams and justin timberlake , is being sold to clear debts .
vivendi chief jean-bernard levy said the deal was " a unique opportunity to grow our music publishing business " .
the transaction requires approval from regulatory authorities .
wider range bmg music publishing , the world 's third-largest music publisher behind universal and emi , made 81m euros in profits in 2005 by licensing songs for use in films , video games ringtones and other media as well as through records .
other artists it owns rights to include barry manilow , mariah carey and the beach boys .
the deal bolsters the music catalogue of vivendi universal - which last week struck a deal with online music business spiralfrog to make its tunes available as free internet downloads .
the sale of bmg music publishing has been approved by the supervisory boards of both companies .
bertelsmann said the sale would help to clear some of the 4.5bn euros debt it took on when it bought out the 25 % stake that groupe bruxelles lambert -lrb- gbl -rrb- held in bertelsmann .
the purchase was the only way bertelsmann could stop gbl from forcing a stock market listing of the media group .

the division , which owns rights to artists including coldplay , robbie williams and justin timberlake , is being sold to clear debts .
vivendi chief jean-bernard levy said the deal was " a unique opportunity to grow our music publishing business " .
the transaction requires approval from regulatory authorities .
wider range bmg music publishing , the world 's third-largest music publisher behind universal and emi , made 81m euros in profits in 2005 by licensing songs for use in films , video games ringtones and other media as well as through records .
other artists it owns rights to include barry manilow , mariah carey and the beach boys .
the deal bolsters the music catalogue of vivendi universal - which last week struck a deal with online music business spiralfrog to make its tunes available as free internet downloads .
the sale of bmg music publishing has been approved by the supervisory boards of both companies .
bertelsmann said the sale would help to clear some of the 4.5bn euros debt it took on when it bought out the 25 % stake that groupe bruxelles lambert -lrb- gbl -rrb- held in bertelsmann .
the purchase was the only way bertelsmann could stop gbl from forcing a stock market listing of the media group .

the body has upped its forecast for china 's growth rate to 10.4 % , from its previous prediction of 9.5 % .
china 's growth shows no sign of slowing down despite government efforts to cool activity in areas such as construction .
indian output is also set to exceed earlier expectations , with its economy now forecast to grow by 7.8 % this year .
this is up from the 7.6 % annual rise predicted in april .
' strong performances ' in its latest update on the region 's economy , the adb said china and india would bolster developing asia 's growth as a whole in 2006 , forecasts for which it has revised upwards from 7.2 % to 7.7 % .
but it warned that countries in the region needed to adjust more quickly to high oil prices and do more to stimulate investment . "
developing asia 's rapid growth is underpinned by strong performances by china and india " ifzal ali , adb chief economist in its own update on tuesday , the organisation for economic development -lrb- oecd -rrb- revised its growth forecast for the g7 countries upwards to 3 % , but clipped japan 's growth projection from 2.8 % to 2.5 % .
the chinese economy grew by 10.9 % in the first half of 2006 against the same period a year ago , surprising many observers by its continued red-hot performance .
beijing has sought to control the pace of growth by slowing public spending and limiting the availability of bank credit .
however , private sector investment has continued unabated while exports remain buoyant .
2007 forecast the adb has also significantly raised its 2007 economic forecast for china , now expecting growth of 9.5 % , compared with its earlier prediction of 8.8 % .
" developing asia 's rapid growth is underpinned by strong performances by china and india , " said ifzal ali , the adb 's chief economist .
" the outlook for asian growth is quite positive as both domestic and external conditions remain favourable . "
elsewhere in the region , the adb said it expected pakistan and bangladesh to grow faster than first forecast due to healthy exports , and it also raised its growth estimates for singapore , sri lanka , the philippines and afghanistan .
however , it said political uncertainty in thailand ahead of expected elections next month had caused it to downgrade its forecasts .
for 2007 , the adb is now forecasting growth across the region of 7.1 % , compared with the 7 % outlined in april .

the body has upped its forecast for china 's growth rate to 10.4 % , from its previous prediction of 9.5 % .
china 's growth shows no sign of slowing down despite government efforts to cool activity in areas such as construction .
indian output is also set to exceed earlier expectations , with its economy now forecast to grow by 7.8 % this year .
this is up from the 7.6 % annual rise predicted in april .
' strong performances ' in its latest update on the region 's economy , the adb said china and india would bolster developing asia 's growth as a whole in 2006 , forecasts for which it has revised upwards from 7.2 % to 7.7 % .
but it warned that countries in the region needed to adjust more quickly to high oil prices and do more to stimulate investment .
developing asia 's rapid growth is underpinned by strong performances by china and india ifzal ali , adb chief economist in its own update on tuesday , the organisation for economic development -lrb- oecd -rrb- revised its growth forecast for the g7 countries upwards to 3 % , but clipped japan 's growth projection from 2.8 % to 2.5 % .
the chinese economy grew by 10.9 % in the first half of 2006 against the same period a year ago , surprising many observers by its continued red-hot performance .
beijing has sought to control the pace of growth by slowing public spending and limiting the availability of bank credit .
however , private sector investment has continued unabated while exports remain buoyant .
2007 forecast the adb has also significantly raised its 2007 economic forecast for china , now expecting growth of 9.5 % , compared with its earlier prediction of 8.8 % .
" developing asia 's rapid growth is underpinned by strong performances by china and india , " said ifzal ali , the adb 's chief economist .
" the outlook for asian growth is quite positive as both domestic and external conditions remain favourable . "
elsewhere in the region , the adb said it expected pakistan and bangladesh to grow faster than first forecast due to healthy exports , and it also raised its growth estimates for singapore , sri lanka , the philippines and afghanistan .
however , it said political uncertainty in thailand ahead of expected elections next month had caused it to downgrade its forecasts .
for 2007 , the adb is now forecasting growth across the region of 7.1 % , compared with the 7 % outlined in april .

others are searching for light from the first stars to shine in the universe over 13 billion years ago , a task which has so far proved impossible .
around the world these scientists are doing what they do best - detecting the things they can not see amid a background of things they can .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , a maverick band of astronomers in europe and the us decided that simply being unable to see a planet orbiting another star was insufficient reason for not looking .
their success hinged on an attempt to pick up the subtle motions of stars they could see being tugged by orbiting planets which they could n't .
this was a daunting prospect , given how subtle such motions might be .
" a big planet only pulls its star at the speed that a human can run , " explains professor geoff marcy from the university of california at berkeley , one of the original planet-hunting pioneers .
attempts to detect such tiny motions across light-years of space took almost 10 years , recalls marcy .
" and the first planets found to be causing them were real giants - many times the size of jupiter and orbiting so close to their stars they caused relatively large , more easily detectable stellar wobbles . "
to look back across 13 billion years of time to when the universe was just a baby is a remarkable accomplishment for human kind garth illingworth today , the prizes in this field are to be found in locating smaller planets .
worlds of the sizes currently being sought will only wobble their stars at the speeds an insect crawls across a table - just a few centimetres per second .
but such trivial motions , barely detectable by current technology , could betray the presence of something of immense significance : another earth-sized planet .
this is the grail which keeps the teams working on this quest whilst still potentially decades away from the first actual image of such a world .
early dawn also working beyond the limits of their telescopes , in another field of astronomy , are the scientists looking for light from the very first stars to shine in the cosmos .
such ancient light from the first few hundred million years after the big bang has been dimmed and reddened by over 13 billion light-years of space travel across the expanding universe .
" it is tens of billions of times fainter than the stars we see in our night skies , " says professor garth illingworth from the university of california , at santa cruz , whose team used the combined power of the hubble and spitzer space telescopes to find galaxies of stars which developed around 400-600 million years after the big bang .
the hubble space telescope is key to early galaxy detection detection of the cosmic dawn , a few hundred million years before this , might have to wait for the launch of the successor to hubble , the james webb space telescope , planned for 2013 .
but professor richard ellis at the california institute of technology has already snatched some time on a natural " telescope of the future " , as he calls it .
by using the gravitational lensing effect of clusters of nearer galaxies , he has been able to boost the effective magnification of the already mighty keck telescope by as much as 50 times .
his efforts have so far revealed galaxies that existed just 300-400 million years after the big bang .
even this does not take us back to the first stars , which would have materialised perhaps just 100 million years into the universe 's life and lived , on cosmic timescales , fleeting lives .
but such ingenuity might yet reveal them , years before the james webb telescope gets to join the search .
the audacity needed to strive for the precision required to find planets of earth mass around other stars , or to embark on the hunt for the first stars to shine in the universe , is easy to overlook .
but the triumph , against the odds , of actually achieving these herculean goals is also often hidden behind the headlines .
as garth illingworth points out : " to look back across 13 billion years of time to when the universe was just a baby is a remarkable accomplishment for humankind . "

others are searching for light from the first stars to shine in the universe over 13 billion years ago , a task which has so far proved impossible .
around the world these scientists are doing what they do best - detecting the things they can not see amid a background of things they can .
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , a maverick band of astronomers in europe and the us decided that simply being unable to see a planet orbiting another star was insufficient reason for not looking .
their success hinged on an attempt to pick up the subtle motions of stars they could see being tugged by orbiting planets which they could n't .
this was a daunting prospect , given how subtle such motions might be .
" a big planet only pulls its star at the speed that a human can run , " explains professor geoff marcy from the university of california at berkeley , one of the original planet-hunting pioneers .
attempts to detect such tiny motions across light-years of space took almost 10 years , recalls marcy .
" and the first planets found to be causing them were real giants - many times the size of jupiter and orbiting so close to their stars they caused relatively large , more easily detectable stellar wobbles . "
to look back across 13 billion years of time to when the universe was just a baby is a remarkable accomplishment for human kind garth illingworth today , the prizes in this field are to be found in locating smaller planets .
worlds of the sizes currently being sought will only wobble their stars at the speeds an insect crawls across a table - just a few centimetres per second .
but such trivial motions , barely detectable by current technology , could betray the presence of something of immense significance : another earth-sized planet .
this is the grail which keeps the teams working on this quest whilst still potentially decades away from the first actual image of such a world .
early dawn also working beyond the limits of their telescopes , in another field of astronomy , are the scientists looking for light from the very first stars to shine in the cosmos .
such ancient light from the first few hundred million years after the big bang has been dimmed and reddened by over 13 billion light-years of space travel across the expanding universe .
" it is tens of billions of times fainter than the stars we see in our night skies , " says professor garth illingworth from the university of california , at santa cruz , whose team used the combined power of the hubble and spitzer space telescopes to find galaxies of stars which developed around 400-600 million years after the big bang .
the hubble space telescope is key to early galaxy detection detection of the cosmic dawn , a few hundred million years before this , might have to wait for the launch of the successor to hubble , the james webb space telescope , planned for 2013 .
but professor richard ellis at the california institute of technology has already snatched some time on a natural " telescope of the future " , as he calls it .
by using the gravitational lensing effect of clusters of nearer galaxies , he has been able to boost the effective magnification of the already mighty keck telescope by as much as 50 times .
his efforts have so far revealed galaxies that existed just 300-400 million years after the big bang .
even this does not take us back to the first stars , which would have materialised perhaps just 100 million years into the universe 's life and lived , on cosmic timescales , fleeting lives .
but such ingenuity might yet reveal them , years before the james webb telescope gets to join the search .
the audacity needed to strive for the precision required to find planets of earth mass around other stars , or to embark on the hunt for the first stars to shine in the universe , is easy to overlook .
but the triumph , against the odds , of actually achieving these herculean goals is also often hidden behind the headlines .
as garth illingworth points out : " to look back across 13 billion years of time to when the universe was just a baby is a remarkable accomplishment for humankind . "

residents of two villages in gansu province 's hui county were said to be seeking hospital treatment after blood tests showed high levels of lead .
air-born pollution from a nearby smelter was the suspected cause , chinese and hong kong newspapers said .
china 's poor record on environmental pollution is sparking mounting unease .
rapid economic expansion and a push to achieve development targets have sometimes led to safety and environmental concerns being ignored .
' airborne waste ' the beijing daily messenger said that health officials in the villages of xinsi and moba had found almost every family had high levels of lead in their blood .
the daily said 879 people had been affected , but other reports put the figures into the thousands .
an official in hui county told the associated press news agency that a nearby plant was the apparent cause .
" we suspect that they were sickened by pollution caused by a lead smelter nearby that discharged waste into the air , " he said .
the lead plant had been shut down , he said , and the local government was paying medical bills for the villagers .
an investigation was under way , he said .
' full ' but regional newspaper the huashang daily said residents were travelling to xian in neighbouring shaanxi province for treatment because local officials insisted they were fine .
one resident told the daily all six members of his family had elevated lead levels .
" the hospital is full of people from our county .
everyone from our village has gone there , " the daily quoted him as saying .
" we do n't trust local hospitals because they said our lead concentration levels were normal , so we travel to somewhere further away , " he said .
lead poisoning can damage the nervous system and , in serious cases , cause convulsions and even death .
it is particularly harmful in children and can affect their mental and physical development .
" the paediatric ward is so full and it ca n't accommodate my daughters , we have to come back , " the resident said .
