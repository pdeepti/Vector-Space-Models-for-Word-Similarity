program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.12.2006 european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some libyans in tripoli approve of tuesday 's verdict libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .
bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .
after all , the north african desert nation is one of europe 's most important oil and gas suppliers .

heinrich von pierer , the former ceo of the german engineering company siemens , moved directly to the company 's supervisory board when he retired as ceo in january , 2005 . siemens is under investigation for the possible embezzlement of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- that was allegedly transferred to overseas funds and used as bribe money .

" german businesses no longer seem to share such concerns at all . " the rise in the ifo index " suggests that the german economy will continue to expand at an above-trend pace well into 2007 , " schmieding said . dekabank economist andreas scheuerle suggested that the vat hike would lead to a " short dip " in the first quarter of 2007 , but that the economy would then resume its upward course . " we 'll be able to toast to a very presentable 2007 , " scheuerle said . thomson financial ifr markets analyst zaki kada said the ifo data did " not point to a slowdown next year ... and it is looking increasingly likely that the german economy will weather the vat hike in the first quarter of 2007 .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .
after all , the north african desert nation is one of europe 's most important oil and gas suppliers .

" our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said . " unfortunately we now have to overcome formulas in the initial draft , which depart from these basic principles , " he said , adding that he still thought agreement could be reached .
" if we honestly work on the basis of the agreements , we can reach a deal very soon . " the difference of opinion voiced in moscow , however , raises questions as to whether the united nations security council will be called upon to place sanctions on teheran .
the iranian government has denied working on a nuclear weapon program as accused by the west and insists it is interested only in producing nuclear energy . no agreement found on polish meat ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish veto kept an eu-russia summit from getting off the ground in november while the eu and russia were able to reach a deal on meat from most of the eu 's 25 member states on wednesday , steinmeier is still likely to discuss a standing russian import stop on polish meat products . despite a statement from russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev that an agreement allowing delivery of eu meat products to russia as of jan .
1 had been reached , polish officials maintained that they would not lift a veto on eu-russia talks . " nothing has changed , there was no agreement , " polish eu spokesman zbigniew gnatkowski said wednesday . in november , russia threatened to ban imports from the eu of all products of animal origin as of 2007 owing to concerns over sanitary standards in incoming eu member states bulgaria and romania . poland has contended the ban was not for health reason but politically motivated and has been blocking the start of talks between the bloc and russia on a new political , economic and energy deal , which is meant to replace a decade-old accord that expires next year . meetings with opposition leaders planned in his second day of talks on thursday , steinmeier , who was chief of staff for former chancellor gerhard schröder , a close putin ally , before he became foreign minister , will meet with representatives of russian civil society , including opposition politicians and human rights activists . they were expected to discuss a law that went into effect in april that established stricter state controls over the work and finances of non-governmental organizations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

the euro was swapping hands at $ 1.3228 early wednesday , up from $ 1.3190 late tuesday . the munich-based ifo institute said its business climate index for germany rose to 108.7 in december , its highest level since 1990 , from 106.8 in november .
analysts had expected a far more modest rise to 107 . " an unexpected jump in the german ifo survey of business conditions in december heightened expectations of further ecb interest rate hikes in 2007 , " wrote national australia bank senior researcher john kyriakopoulos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are confident about the coming year consensus forecasts had been for a steady ifo index reading in december after the barometer returned to a 15-year high in november . the positive performance in the 12-nation euro zone 's largest member is all the more surprising given germany 's upcoming 3 percent rise in vat to 19 percent from jan .
1 , which many experts believe could put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore on economic activity as a whole . a sign for 2007 ? but ifo president hans-werner sinn insisted that the german economy " is in an extraordinarily strong boom last seen in 1990 . " companies were not only feeling confident about their current business but were also more optimistic about the six-month outlook , sinn said . for its monthly survey , ifo polls about 7,000 companies on their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts said the coming vat hike would only lead to a dip in consumption german economics minister michael glos hailed the figure , saying it boded well for next year . " i 'm expecting 2007 to be a successful year for the german economy , " he said . ifo 's own chief economist gernot nerb described the figures as " surprisingly good . " " they show that the recovery particularly in the manufacturing sector is continuing , " nerb added . germany ready for vat hike analysts too were cheered by the robustness of the data . " did anybody ever worry about the impact of the looming vat hike , the stronger euro or the us slowdown on the german economy ? " asked bank of america economist holger schmieding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.12.2006 european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some libyans in tripoli approve of tuesday 's verdict libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .
bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .
after all , the north african desert nation is one of europe 's most important oil and gas suppliers .

the euro was swapping hands at $ 1.3228 early wednesday , up from $ 1.3190 late tuesday . the munich-based ifo institute said its business climate index for germany rose to 108.7 in december , its highest level since 1990 , from 106.8 in november .
analysts had expected a far more modest rise to 107 . " an unexpected jump in the german ifo survey of business conditions in december heightened expectations of further ecb interest rate hikes in 2007 , " wrote national australia bank senior researcher john kyriakopoulos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german companies are confident about the coming year consensus forecasts had been for a steady ifo index reading in december after the barometer returned to a 15-year high in november . the positive performance in the 12-nation euro zone 's largest member is all the more surprising given germany 's upcoming 3 percent rise in vat to 19 percent from jan .

" i 'm expecting 2007 to be a successful year for the german economy , " he said . ifo 's own chief economist gernot nerb described the figures as " surprisingly good . " " they show that the recovery particularly in the manufacturing sector is continuing , " nerb added . germany ready for vat hike analysts too were cheered by the robustness of the data . " did anybody ever worry about the impact of the looming vat hike , the stronger euro or the us slowdown on the german economy ? " asked bank of america economist holger schmieding .
" german businesses no longer seem to share such concerns at all . " the rise in the ifo index " suggests that the german economy will continue to expand at an above-trend pace well into 2007 , " schmieding said . dekabank economist andreas scheuerle suggested that the vat hike would lead to a " short dip " in the first quarter of 2007 , but that the economy would then resume its upward course . " we 'll be able to toast to a very presentable 2007 , " scheuerle said . thomson financial ifr markets analyst zaki kada said the ifo data did " not point to a slowdown next year ... and it is looking increasingly likely that the german economy will weather the vat hike in the first quarter of 2007 .

in germany , departing ceos often take over leadership of their companies ' supervisory boards . germany 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have already reached an agreement on the supervisory board issue , according to the handelsblatt newspaper . a management board member should not hold a seat on his company 's own supervisory board for five years after his contract as ceo has expired , michael fuchs , the economics affairs spokesman for the cdu told handelsblatt . siemens scandal causes changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retired siemens ceo heinrich von pierer for ceos of german blue-chip companies listed on the elite dax 30 index , heading up the supervisory board after retirement remains a common practice , despite possible conflicts of interest .
yet the ongoing siemens scandal has caused the german government to look for ways to tighten up corporate governance laws . siemens has become a prime example of the cozy relationship between ceos and their supervisory boards .
heinrich von pierer , the former ceo of the german engineering company siemens , moved directly to the company 's supervisory board when he retired as ceo in january , 2005 . siemens is under investigation for the possible embezzlement of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- that was allegedly transferred to overseas funds and used as bribe money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .

stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .

they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.12.2006 european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some libyans in tripoli approve of tuesday 's verdict libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .
bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

in germany , departing ceos often take over leadership of their companies ' supervisory boards . germany 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have already reached an agreement on the supervisory board issue , according to the handelsblatt newspaper . a management board member should not hold a seat on his company 's own supervisory board for five years after his contract as ceo has expired , michael fuchs , the economics affairs spokesman for the cdu told handelsblatt . siemens scandal causes changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retired siemens ceo heinrich von pierer for ceos of german blue-chip companies listed on the elite dax 30 index , heading up the supervisory board after retirement remains a common practice , despite possible conflicts of interest .
yet the ongoing siemens scandal has caused the german government to look for ways to tighten up corporate governance laws . siemens has become a prime example of the cozy relationship between ceos and their supervisory boards .
heinrich von pierer , the former ceo of the german engineering company siemens , moved directly to the company 's supervisory board when he retired as ceo in january , 2005 . siemens is under investigation for the possible embezzlement of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- that was allegedly transferred to overseas funds and used as bribe money .
so far , von pierer has not been directly implicated in the bribery scandal , but the investigation could stretch back to when he was ceo . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens slush-fund scandal deepens , former exec in custody german engineering giant siemens has said an internal audit had uncovered as much as 420 million euros -lrb- $ 554 million -rrb- in suspicious payments as part of the ongoing probe into an alleged bribery and embezzlement scandal .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .
" the impact of such offenses should n't be underestimated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving denies that auschwitz was a purpose-built extermination camp the jewish community in vienna described the decision to free irving as an " erroneous verdict . " coming on the heels of the holocaust deniers ' conference in tehran , the verdict sends the wrong signal and ignores the principle of general prevention , " the community said in a statement . the director of the simon wiesenthal center in israel , ephraim zuroff , sharply criticized the verdict . " irving is , ideologically speaking , probably the most dangerous holocaust denier of the present times , " zuroff told the austrian press agency . court still investigating irving the state prosecutor 's office in vienna is currently investigating irving for a similar crime of holocaust denial .
however , a spokesperson said the suspected crime was n't enough to warrant holding irving in prison . irving 's lawyer said his client would leave the country immediately , and added he had advised irving to give interviews to the press only after he had left austrian soil . denying the holocaust is a crime in austria , as well as in a number of other european countries such as germany and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .
after all , the north african desert nation is one of europe 's most important oil and gas suppliers .

" after closing hanau , the government has not searched for other alternatives , " she said .
" now , a quick solution is needed , and saxony-anhalt should be the stopgap .

in germany , departing ceos often take over leadership of their companies ' supervisory boards . germany 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have already reached an agreement on the supervisory board issue , according to the handelsblatt newspaper . a management board member should not hold a seat on his company 's own supervisory board for five years after his contract as ceo has expired , michael fuchs , the economics affairs spokesman for the cdu told handelsblatt . siemens scandal causes changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retired siemens ceo heinrich von pierer for ceos of german blue-chip companies listed on the elite dax 30 index , heading up the supervisory board after retirement remains a common practice , despite possible conflicts of interest .
yet the ongoing siemens scandal has caused the german government to look for ways to tighten up corporate governance laws . siemens has become a prime example of the cozy relationship between ceos and their supervisory boards .
heinrich von pierer , the former ceo of the german engineering company siemens , moved directly to the company 's supervisory board when he retired as ceo in january , 2005 . siemens is under investigation for the possible embezzlement of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- that was allegedly transferred to overseas funds and used as bribe money .
so far , von pierer has not been directly implicated in the bribery scandal , but the investigation could stretch back to when he was ceo . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens slush-fund scandal deepens , former exec in custody german engineering giant siemens has said an internal audit had uncovered as much as 420 million euros -lrb- $ 554 million -rrb- in suspicious payments as part of the ongoing probe into an alleged bribery and embezzlement scandal .

" after closing hanau , the government has not searched for other alternatives , " she said .
" now , a quick solution is needed , and saxony-anhalt should be the stopgap . " the state government wants federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to go over the plans and look for other alternatives . morsleben has been used since 1971 as a storage area for low- and mid-level radioactive waste . long-term solutions needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waste from nuclear facilities has to go somewhere germany continues to search for long-term solutions for storing its high-level radioactive nuclear waste .
earlier this year , a court in the state of lower saxony overturned lawsuits aimed at keeping a former iron ore mine from being converted into a permanent nuclear waste storage facility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .

she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.12.2006 european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some libyans in tripoli approve of tuesday 's verdict libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .
bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .
after all , the north african desert nation is one of europe 's most important oil and gas suppliers .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .

" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "
" a scandalous verdict , even if it will very likely not be carried out , " austria 's salzburger nachrichten speculated .
" inner political peace was more important to muammar gaddafi than justice and harmony with the west .
that the eu , which bulgaria will join in january , will take a more critical approach toward libya following this unjust verdict is unlikely .

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .

but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

mercury has been seeping from the u-boat for more than 60 years . in 1945 , the german submarine u-864 was on its way to deliver mercury for weapons production to war-time ally japan , when it was torpedoed off norway 's western coast .
all of the 73 men on board went down with the u-boat , as did the steel containers filled with 65-tonnes of weapons-grade mercury .
the norwegian navy spent years looking for the submarine .
they finally located it in 2003 , lying in 150 meters of water near the island of fedje , some 70 km from bergen .
over the next three years , the coastal authority conducted field studies looking at how best to deal with the ecological time-bomb ticking in the north sea . contaminated ocean speaking to dw-world.de , ane eide kjeras , a spokesperson with the norwegian coastal administration , said the sea bed surrounding the wreck was " heavily contaminated " with mercury .
there was also " a low but increasing level of mercury in fish and sea food , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing is banned within a one kilometer zone around the wreck not only is mercury a danger to marine life , it can also pose a hazard to humans who eat the contaminated sea food . the norwegian coastal administration has now recommended hermetically sealing off the submarine and surrounding silt in a layer of sand , gravel and concrete - an underwater version of the chernobly nuclear reactor . there are several good reasons not to attempt to salvage the u-boat , kjeras said . " when divers tried to dig into the keel of the u-boat , the wreck started to move because the ground there is very unstable , " kjeras said .
" there was also crack in the keel so we are afraid to salvage the u-boat in case it splits and all of the mercury spills into the ocean . " wwii weapons on board and then there is also the danger that the world war ii submarine is still armed . " we have to assume there were at least a couple of torpedoes on board , " said kjeras , adding that the norwegian army were closely involved in the investigation . " they advised us that the danger of the torpedoes going off is much larger if you try to lift the wreck , " kjeras told dw-world.de. the norwegian government has n't decided on the exact details of how to seal off the submarine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 20.12.2006 steinmeier heads to moscow to discuss g8 , eu plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is preparing for his role as president of the european council german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will meet russian president vladimir putin on thursday for talks on berlin 's presidencies of the g8 and the eu starting next month , his ministry said . a foreign ministry spokesman said steinmeier would " take the baton " from russia , which held the rotating presidency of the group of eight most industrialized nations in 2006 , and discuss berlin 's plans for the european union in the first half of the year . steinmeier , who will arrive in moscow late wednesday for talks with deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev , will discuss the dispute with iran over its nuclear ambitions and eu-russia ties with his counterpart sergei lavrov and putin on thursday , the spokesman said . germany has worked closely with the five permanent members of the united nations security council - britain , china , france , russia , and the united states - to cobble together a resolution imposing economic sanctions on iran over its refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment program . russia unhappy with proposed iran sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and europe ca n't agree on how to deal with iran 's nuclear program lavrov , however , said on wednesday that a draft put together by germany , france and britain was too strict because it curbed legitimate business deals with teheran instead of restricting only goods related to iran 's nuclear plan . " our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said . " unfortunately we now have to overcome formulas in the initial draft , which depart from these basic principles , " he said , adding that he still thought agreement could be reached .
" if we honestly work on the basis of the agreements , we can reach a deal very soon . " the difference of opinion voiced in moscow , however , raises questions as to whether the united nations security council will be called upon to place sanctions on teheran .
the iranian government has denied working on a nuclear weapon program as accused by the west and insists it is interested only in producing nuclear energy . no agreement found on polish meat ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish veto kept an eu-russia summit from getting off the ground in november while the eu and russia were able to reach a deal on meat from most of the eu 's 25 member states on wednesday , steinmeier is still likely to discuss a standing russian import stop on polish meat products . despite a statement from russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev that an agreement allowing delivery of eu meat products to russia as of jan .
1 had been reached , polish officials maintained that they would not lift a veto on eu-russia talks . " nothing has changed , there was no agreement , " polish eu spokesman zbigniew gnatkowski said wednesday . in november , russia threatened to ban imports from the eu of all products of animal origin as of 2007 owing to concerns over sanitary standards in incoming eu member states bulgaria and romania . poland has contended the ban was not for health reason but politically motivated and has been blocking the start of talks between the bloc and russia on a new political , economic and energy deal , which is meant to replace a decade-old accord that expires next year . meetings with opposition leaders planned in his second day of talks on thursday , steinmeier , who was chief of staff for former chancellor gerhard schröder , a close putin ally , before he became foreign minister , will meet with representatives of russian civil society , including opposition politicians and human rights activists . they were expected to discuss a law that went into effect in april that established stricter state controls over the work and finances of non-governmental organizations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

" after closing hanau , the government has not searched for other alternatives , " she said .
" now , a quick solution is needed , and saxony-anhalt should be the stopgap .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .
" the impact of such offenses should n't be underestimated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving denies that auschwitz was a purpose-built extermination camp the jewish community in vienna described the decision to free irving as an " erroneous verdict . " coming on the heels of the holocaust deniers ' conference in tehran , the verdict sends the wrong signal and ignores the principle of general prevention , " the community said in a statement . the director of the simon wiesenthal center in israel , ephraim zuroff , sharply criticized the verdict . " irving is , ideologically speaking , probably the most dangerous holocaust denier of the present times , " zuroff told the austrian press agency . court still investigating irving the state prosecutor 's office in vienna is currently investigating irving for a similar crime of holocaust denial .
however , a spokesperson said the suspected crime was n't enough to warrant holding irving in prison . irving 's lawyer said his client would leave the country immediately , and added he had advised irving to give interviews to the press only after he had left austrian soil . denying the holocaust is a crime in austria , as well as in a number of other european countries such as germany and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

" our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said . " unfortunately we now have to overcome formulas in the initial draft , which depart from these basic principles , " he said , adding that he still thought agreement could be reached .
" if we honestly work on the basis of the agreements , we can reach a deal very soon . " the difference of opinion voiced in moscow , however , raises questions as to whether the united nations security council will be called upon to place sanctions on teheran .
the iranian government has denied working on a nuclear weapon program as accused by the west and insists it is interested only in producing nuclear energy . no agreement found on polish meat ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish veto kept an eu-russia summit from getting off the ground in november while the eu and russia were able to reach a deal on meat from most of the eu 's 25 member states on wednesday , steinmeier is still likely to discuss a standing russian import stop on polish meat products . despite a statement from russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev that an agreement allowing delivery of eu meat products to russia as of jan .
1 had been reached , polish officials maintained that they would not lift a veto on eu-russia talks . " nothing has changed , there was no agreement , " polish eu spokesman zbigniew gnatkowski said wednesday . in november , russia threatened to ban imports from the eu of all products of animal origin as of 2007 owing to concerns over sanitary standards in incoming eu member states bulgaria and romania . poland has contended the ban was not for health reason but politically motivated and has been blocking the start of talks between the bloc and russia on a new political , economic and energy deal , which is meant to replace a decade-old accord that expires next year . meetings with opposition leaders planned in his second day of talks on thursday , steinmeier , who was chief of staff for former chancellor gerhard schröder , a close putin ally , before he became foreign minister , will meet with representatives of russian civil society , including opposition politicians and human rights activists . they were expected to discuss a law that went into effect in april that established stricter state controls over the work and finances of non-governmental organizations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .
" the impact of such offenses should n't be underestimated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving denies that auschwitz was a purpose-built extermination camp the jewish community in vienna described the decision to free irving as an " erroneous verdict . " coming on the heels of the holocaust deniers ' conference in tehran , the verdict sends the wrong signal and ignores the principle of general prevention , " the community said in a statement . the director of the simon wiesenthal center in israel , ephraim zuroff , sharply criticized the verdict . " irving is , ideologically speaking , probably the most dangerous holocaust denier of the present times , " zuroff told the austrian press agency . court still investigating irving the state prosecutor 's office in vienna is currently investigating irving for a similar crime of holocaust denial .
however , a spokesperson said the suspected crime was n't enough to warrant holding irving in prison . irving 's lawyer said his client would leave the country immediately , and added he had advised irving to give interviews to the press only after he had left austrian soil . denying the holocaust is a crime in austria , as well as in a number of other european countries such as germany and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .
" the impact of such offenses should n't be underestimated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving denies that auschwitz was a purpose-built extermination camp the jewish community in vienna described the decision to free irving as an " erroneous verdict . " coming on the heels of the holocaust deniers ' conference in tehran , the verdict sends the wrong signal and ignores the principle of general prevention , " the community said in a statement . the director of the simon wiesenthal center in israel , ephraim zuroff , sharply criticized the verdict . " irving is , ideologically speaking , probably the most dangerous holocaust denier of the present times , " zuroff told the austrian press agency . court still investigating irving the state prosecutor 's office in vienna is currently investigating irving for a similar crime of holocaust denial .
however , a spokesperson said the suspected crime was n't enough to warrant holding irving in prison . irving 's lawyer said his client would leave the country immediately , and added he had advised irving to give interviews to the press only after he had left austrian soil . denying the holocaust is a crime in austria , as well as in a number of other european countries such as germany and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's holocaust conference plan prompts anger a proposed conference that stirred ire in germany earlier this year is now slated to take place next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 20.12.2006 european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some libyans in tripoli approve of tuesday 's verdict libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .
bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .
libya wanted the death sentences from the very beginning in order to gain favor among its own population .
and : in order to get more funds from the eu to care for the sick children .
a horrible form of blackmail … , " the paper surmised .
" libya 's sentencing of the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to death was an act of cynicism , " paris ' daily liberation said .
" people know that the libyan children were infected with hiv before the foreign medical personnel arrived in the country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader muammar gadhafi london 's times took a pragmatic approach .
" the west had hoped that when libya decided to give up its mass destruction weapons program in 2003 , the path was paved for a quick return to normal relations .
there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .
switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung broadened the perspective when its commentator wrote that " the european union will likely not just consider the death sentence given to the six medics a step back , but more even so , to be a slap in the face .
since last year , the eu has been helping libya try to get its aids epidemic under control through an expensive plan of action . "

bulgaria has support from eu member states . " the command has been carried out , " according to bonn 's general-anzeiger .
" just recently , libyan leader muammar gadhafi repeatedly made public demands that the five bulgarian nurses be punished .
his motives are clear : after the compensation payments running into the millions to the relatives of the 270 victims who died in the 1988 pan am airliner bombing over lockerbie , scotland , for which libya has claimed responsibility , and for the 1986 ' la belle ' disco bombing in berlin , he needs political leverage against the west as it tries to cozy up to the north african country . "
the rennes-based french paper oest-france commented that " it 's an abominable story in which the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor have been tied up in libya .
it is also an absurd tale .
from the beginning it has been evident that the libyan government would try to deflect criticism of its country by turning foreigners in the country into scapegoats to carry the burden of its own failures … yet it was the government in tripoli which allowed the situation in its hospitals to deteriorate so badly that it prompted the aids epidemic .

there was hope that investments would rise and cultural exchange would be possible … this death sentence shows that the rehabilitation of libya will occur neither quickly , nor painlessly , " the paper wrote .

" our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said .

but it was n't until irving re-entered austria 17 years later , in november 2005 , that he was arrested for those crimes .
in february 2006 , the court sentenced irving to three years in prison for denying the holocaust .
on wednesday , vienna 's court of appeal ruled that the 68-year-old irving did n't need to serve the remainder of his term in prison , and has freed the british historian on probation .
" the fact that the offense was committed a long time ago , 17 years , was a mitigating circumstance , " said judge ernest maurer .
the defense had argued that the three-year sentence was too severe .
irving received fan mail in prison prosecutor marie-luise nittel told the court that irving had received numerous letters from fans while he was in prison .
she said he was " icon of the radical right-wing community " and a " dangerous criminal personality . " his comments were a real mockery of all the victims of the nazi regime , " nittel said .
" the impact of such offenses should n't be underestimated . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irving denies that auschwitz was a purpose-built extermination camp the jewish community in vienna described the decision to free irving as an " erroneous verdict .

in germany , departing ceos often take over leadership of their companies ' supervisory boards . germany 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its coalition partner , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have already reached an agreement on the supervisory board issue , according to the handelsblatt newspaper . a management board member should not hold a seat on his company 's own supervisory board for five years after his contract as ceo has expired , michael fuchs , the economics affairs spokesman for the cdu told handelsblatt . siemens scandal causes changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retired siemens ceo heinrich von pierer for ceos of german blue-chip companies listed on the elite dax 30 index , heading up the supervisory board after retirement remains a common practice , despite possible conflicts of interest .
yet the ongoing siemens scandal has caused the german government to look for ways to tighten up corporate governance laws . siemens has become a prime example of the cozy relationship between ceos and their supervisory boards .
heinrich von pierer , the former ceo of the german engineering company siemens , moved directly to the company 's supervisory board when he retired as ceo in january , 2005 . siemens is under investigation for the possible embezzlement of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 260 million -rrb- that was allegedly transferred to overseas funds and used as bribe money .

" our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said . " unfortunately we now have to overcome formulas in the initial draft , which depart from these basic principles , " he said , adding that he still thought agreement could be reached .
" if we honestly work on the basis of the agreements , we can reach a deal very soon . " the difference of opinion voiced in moscow , however , raises questions as to whether the united nations security council will be called upon to place sanctions on teheran .
the iranian government has denied working on a nuclear weapon program as accused by the west and insists it is interested only in producing nuclear energy . no agreement found on polish meat ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish veto kept an eu-russia summit from getting off the ground in november while the eu and russia were able to reach a deal on meat from most of the eu 's 25 member states on wednesday , steinmeier is still likely to discuss a standing russian import stop on polish meat products . despite a statement from russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev that an agreement allowing delivery of eu meat products to russia as of jan .
1 had been reached , polish officials maintained that they would not lift a veto on eu-russia talks . " nothing has changed , there was no agreement , " polish eu spokesman zbigniew gnatkowski said wednesday . in november , russia threatened to ban imports from the eu of all products of animal origin as of 2007 owing to concerns over sanitary standards in incoming eu member states bulgaria and romania . poland has contended the ban was not for health reason but politically motivated and has been blocking the start of talks between the bloc and russia on a new political , economic and energy deal , which is meant to replace a decade-old accord that expires next year . meetings with opposition leaders planned in his second day of talks on thursday , steinmeier , who was chief of staff for former chancellor gerhard schröder , a close putin ally , before he became foreign minister , will meet with representatives of russian civil society , including opposition politicians and human rights activists . they were expected to discuss a law that went into effect in april that established stricter state controls over the work and finances of non-governmental organizations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 20.12.2006 kidnapped , abused girls remain in spotlight after liberation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after world headlines of her escape in august , natascha kampusch is in the news again natascha kampusch , who was kidnapped , abused for eight years and finally escaped in august , recently gave a new interview about her ordeal .
but was it a good idea ?
dw-world.de spoke with a psychologist and trauma expert . in an interview with austrian public television orf , which was aired on tuesday , natascha kampusch said she was still plagued by her ordeal and found it tough adjusting to her new , free life .
she said she had difficulty eating , going out alone or being in large crowds . she now lives alone in vienna and has access to counselors to help her recover . kidnapped in 1998 , kampusch was forced to live in a basement cell for eight years .
her extraordinary escape in august made headlines around the world .
kampusch 's life is the subject of a recent book by two british journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natascha 's september interview on orf another similar case not unlike kampusch , then 13-year-old stephanie rudolph - a german - was seized on her way to school in dresden in january . during her five weeks of captivity , her kidnapper repeatedly raped her .
rudolph managed to drop a note on the sidewalk during a rare walk with her abuser .
a passerby spotted it and alerted police , who freed her after several bumbled attempts .
rudolph likewise gave an interview in late september - shortly after kampusch 's first one on orf - to german public broadcaster zdf . rudolph 's captor was given the maximum sentence last week of 15 years in prison . dw-world.de spoke with german child psychologist and trauma expert christian lüdke about the effects of going public with such dramatic events . dw-world.de : is it damaging to the girls to give public interviews ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian lüdke christian lüdke : both are victims of unbelievably violent acts .
their childhoods were ended brutally and abominably .
they were traumatized and need protection and a sense of security . in general , i think it is right to give the victims a voice , to allow them to speak in public about what happened to them , but only when they are truly ready and when it is beneficial to them . in natascha 's case , she gave the interview when she was still in shock , in stephanie 's case , while the trial was underway .
it was as though they should sell their souls in the way they were asked to divulge information to the public . the german public broadcaster zdf requested my opinion about stephanie rudolph appearing on their talk show , and i strongly advised against it . i believe such an appearance takes away from the magnitude of the situation ; it belittles it .
the girls present themselves as stable individuals who have hardly been hurt at all .
the culprit is then affirmed in a certain way , and the whole situation appears less dramatic than it actually was . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions tuned into natascha 's first interview in september but in both of these cases , the girls approached the media , and not the other way around . in natascha 's case , her advisors said the paparazzi was chasing her and rather than giving in to them , the whole business could be turned upside down .
in my opinion , that was the wrong advice .
they could have simply published a picture of natascha , and protected her that way . i found it appalling that during the interview she just suppressed the horrible events .
in the end , it was as if a fairy tale were being presented .
people wanted to see a fairy tale and they got it : it was as if a girl like " sleeping beauty " had suddenly appeared after 100 years .
she 's pretty , she 's eloquent , and people end up forgetting that she has been brutally abused . and stephanie ? i think it was her father 's interests which were being served , and her lawyers ' - they wanted to be in the limelight .
stephanie should have been protected more and been given peace and quiet , and not been confronted with the whole situation again , especially not with the culprit .
again , it is right to give victims a voice , but not in such a way that other people gain attention for it .
that is reprehensible - both from a professional and a human standpoint .
it is a form of victim abuse . nonetheless , could the girls ' interviews perhaps have helped other victims of violent acts who may have been watching ? there were probably thousands of people watching who may have experienced something similar - abuse , rape , being held involuntarily - but i do n't believe that natascha 's and stephanie 's descriptions were cathartic for them .
it could n't have been healing for them .
the images just come flooding back , which can lead to further trauma .
the can of worms is opened up again , the show comes to an end , and then they stand there helpless and alone .
that ca n't be helpful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario mederake received 15-years in jail for kidnapping and abusing stephanie r. why are other people interested in watching such interviews ? they are fascinated by that which is repugnant , but there 's another reason : hearing such stories also offers relief to some people .
they feel relieved that such horrible events have not happened to them or their loved ones .
however , the latest studies show that for many people who are permanently confronted with such violence on television , a slow trauma process creeps up on them - they gradually lose a sense of security themselves by hearing about such violent acts in the media . how can one go about the whole issue better ? i think it 's right to inform the public , and to do it quickly and comprehensively - to explain what happened to the victims because providing information , after all , also gives people a sense of security .
it 's also right since the perpetrators are so often presented as victors , while the victims are shown as losers .
actually , i find the victims to be the stronger ones because they have survived , and it takes courage to talk to the public .
but one should respect their boundaries so that an interview does not become another form of abuse . # b # also , in stephanie 's case , she did not appear in court to testify against her captor .
that was the right decision .
she should n't have to confront her victimizer and be traumatized again . what is a healthy way for victims to try to come to terms with such an experience ? such traumatic experiences rob victims of a fundamental sense of security .
the acts imprint themselves on their souls and in how they feel about their bodies .
but every human being has his or her own method of recovery and self-healing .
the most essential thing is that survivors live in a peaceful atmosphere and gain distance to the events .
they should do nice things and not be constantly confronted with the negative experiences .
young people in particular need a safe environment and reliable people around them who convey a sense of hope .
these young girls will never be able to forget what happened to them , but everyone has the ability to overcome even the most horrible events imaginable given the proper support . louisa schaefer interviewed christian lüdke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german child-sex kidnapper sentenced to 15 years a german court on thursday sentenced a 36-year-old man to the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison for the kidnapping and repeated sexual assault of a schoolgirl .

" our partners ... are trying to turn the situation around in their favor by inserting into the resolution statements which would de facto lift all limits on the restraints that are being introduced in iran and will sever ... economic ties with iran in completely legitimate areas , " he said . the five permanent security council members and germany had agreed that any action against iran should rule out the use of force , help find a negotiated solution to the issue and support the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , lavrov said . " unfortunately we now have to overcome formulas in the initial draft , which depart from these basic principles , " he said , adding that he still thought agreement could be reached .
" if we honestly work on the basis of the agreements , we can reach a deal very soon . " the difference of opinion voiced in moscow , however , raises questions as to whether the united nations security council will be called upon to place sanctions on teheran .
the iranian government has denied working on a nuclear weapon program as accused by the west and insists it is interested only in producing nuclear energy . no agreement found on polish meat ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish veto kept an eu-russia summit from getting off the ground in november while the eu and russia were able to reach a deal on meat from most of the eu 's 25 member states on wednesday , steinmeier is still likely to discuss a standing russian import stop on polish meat products . despite a statement from russian agriculture minister alexei gordeyev that an agreement allowing delivery of eu meat products to russia as of jan .
1 had been reached , polish officials maintained that they would not lift a veto on eu-russia talks . " nothing has changed , there was no agreement , " polish eu spokesman zbigniew gnatkowski said wednesday . in november , russia threatened to ban imports from the eu of all products of animal origin as of 2007 owing to concerns over sanitary standards in incoming eu member states bulgaria and romania . poland has contended the ban was not for health reason but politically motivated and has been blocking the start of talks between the bloc and russia on a new political , economic and energy deal , which is meant to replace a decade-old accord that expires next year . meetings with opposition leaders planned in his second day of talks on thursday , steinmeier , who was chief of staff for former chancellor gerhard schröder , a close putin ally , before he became foreign minister , will meet with representatives of russian civil society , including opposition politicians and human rights activists . they were expected to discuss a law that went into effect in april that established stricter state controls over the work and finances of non-governmental organizations . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu summit closes with focus on middle east as a summit of european leaders concluded friday , chancellor angela merkel said germany would take over the eu presidency in january knowing that it had members ' support for an ambitious six-month program .

councillor peter o 'reilly urged people to recycle their christmas cards and trees as well as their normal waste .
" christmas is a time when a lot of additional waste is created , up to 75 % of which can be recycled , " he said .
" old cards , drinks bottles and even trees can all be recycled and made into new products and our recycling centres will be open over the festive period . "
mr o 'reilly , who chairs the council 's health and environmental services committee , congratulated the city 's residents for taking to recycling " with great gusto " .
" the fact that we have broken through the 20 % mark shows that the message is getting through and people are beginning to understand that we must all learn to make recycling the norm , " he said .
the council says that about 700 tonnes of paper , plastic , cardboard and metals is collected from blue bins across belfast for recycling each month .
it says this will increase when the latest phase of the recycling scheme is rolled out in the west of the city .
landfill donations meanwhile , it has emerged that landfill operators have given more than £ 11m to community , social and environmental projects in northern ireland in the last 10 years .
the donations were part of the landfill communities fund -lrb- formerly the landfill tax credit scheme -rrb- which allows landfill site operators to donate part of their annual tax to environmental bodies .
projects helped include the transformation of a derelict church in newcastle , county down , into an indoor skateboarding park with the help of a £ 25,000 grant to the wildlife trust .
and a £ 5,000 grant helped sandelford special school in coleraine to create a multi-sensory garden for children , incorporating various beds of wildflowers , fruit and vegetables .
financial secretary to the treasury john healey said : " from a few hundred pounds to help renovate a village hall , to a few thousand to help establish a local nature reserve , the landfill communities scheme has helped make a real difference in neighbourhoods across northern ireland . "

" old cards , drinks bottles and even trees can all be recycled and made into new products and our recycling centres will be open over the festive period . "
mr o 'reilly , who chairs the council 's health and environmental services committee , congratulated the city 's residents for taking to recycling " with great gusto " .
" the fact that we have broken through the 20 % mark shows that the message is getting through and people are beginning to understand that we must all learn to make recycling the norm , " he said .
the council says that about 700 tonnes of paper , plastic , cardboard and metals is collected from blue bins across belfast for recycling each month .
it says this will increase when the latest phase of the recycling scheme is rolled out in the west of the city .
landfill donations meanwhile , it has emerged that landfill operators have given more than £ 11m to community , social and environmental projects in northern ireland in the last 10 years .
the donations were part of the landfill communities fund -lrb- formerly the landfill tax credit scheme -rrb- which allows landfill site operators to donate part of their annual tax to environmental bodies .
projects helped include the transformation of a derelict church in newcastle , county down , into an indoor skateboarding park with the help of a £ 25,000 grant to the wildlife trust .
and a £ 5,000 grant helped sandelford special school in coleraine to create a multi-sensory garden for children , incorporating various beds of wildflowers , fruit and vegetables .
financial secretary to the treasury john healey said : " from a few hundred pounds to help renovate a village hall , to a few thousand to help establish a local nature reserve , the landfill communities scheme has helped make a real difference in neighbourhoods across northern ireland . "

ian jolly has already improved telecommunications on bardsey island but the system runs on batteries which need to be changed regularly .
now he plans to make use of the island 's weather and will install a wind turbine to make battery changing a thing of the past .
he hopes the system will support an internet broadband connection .
ian jolly , 61 , from bryn y baal , flintshire , had heard of bardsey but had never visited the island before he was contacted by the trustees in 2000 to help them set up a new phone service on the island .
solar panels " the problem is that the island has no permanent electricity supply and also there is only a mobile phone signal either on high land or the northern tip of the island , " he said .
working for free , mr jolly set up a receiver on the northern tip of the island , which relays the phone signal to houses on the island .
he said phone calls are easier than they were but were expensive because they were on a mobile phone network .
in summer , batteries used to run the system are charged by solar panels , but during the winter someone has to go and change them regularly .
mr jolly decided a small wind turbine would be the answer .
broadband connection a small unit , such as those found on yachts , will be sited low so as not to disrupt the view and also to lessen any chance of low-flying manx shearwaters crashing into it .
ultimately , mr jolly would like to see a broadband connection on the island .
having a phone link with the outside world had " opened up a whole new world " for islanders , he said .
" but it has n't changed the remoteness of the place , it just makes life more liveable on the island , " he added .
bardsey island has been a national nature reserve since 1986 and the trust which runs it is keen on keeping it as ' green ' as possible .
emyr roberts , the island 's warden , said the island would make an " ideal place " for a wind turbine .
the island 's only permanent residents , farmers david and libby barnden , are set to leave and have applied to live on canna in the hebrides - population 15 .
they are leaving bardsey because of " financial circumstances " and not loneliness , they said .

ian jolly has already improved telecommunications on bardsey island but the system runs on batteries which need to be changed regularly .
now he plans to make use of the island 's weather and will install a wind turbine to make battery changing a thing of the past .
he hopes the system will support an internet broadband connection .
ian jolly , 61 , from bryn y baal , flintshire , had heard of bardsey but had never visited the island before he was contacted by the trustees in 2000 to help them set up a new phone service on the island .
solar panels " the problem is that the island has no permanent electricity supply and also there is only a mobile phone signal either on high land or the northern tip of the island , " he said .
working for free , mr jolly set up a receiver on the northern tip of the island , which relays the phone signal to houses on the island .
he said phone calls are easier than they were but were expensive because they were on a mobile phone network .
in summer , batteries used to run the system are charged by solar panels , but during the winter someone has to go and change them regularly .
mr jolly decided a small wind turbine would be the answer .
broadband connection a small unit , such as those found on yachts , will be sited low so as not to disrupt the view and also to lessen any chance of low-flying manx shearwaters crashing into it .
ultimately , mr jolly would like to see a broadband connection on the island .
having a phone link with the outside world had " opened up a whole new world " for islanders , he said .
" but it has n't changed the remoteness of the place , it just makes life more liveable on the island , " he added .
bardsey island has been a national nature reserve since 1986 and the trust which runs it is keen on keeping it as ' green ' as possible .
emyr roberts , the island 's warden , said the island would make an " ideal place " for a wind turbine .
the island 's only permanent residents , farmers david and libby barnden , are set to leave and have applied to live on canna in the hebrides - population 15 .
they are leaving bardsey because of " financial circumstances " and not loneliness , they said .

the move follows a deal between the commercial arm of the organisation , bbc worldwide , and technology firm azureus .
the agreement means that users of azureus ' zudeo software in the us can download titles such as little britain .
until now , most bbc programmes found on peer-to-peer file-sharing networks have been illegal copies .
beth clearfield , vice president of programme management and digital media at bbc worldwide , said that the agreement was part of a drive to reach the largest audience possible .
" we are very excited to partner with azureus and make our content available through this revolutionary distribution model , " she said .

the move follows a deal between the commercial arm of the organisation , bbc worldwide , and technology firm azureus .
the agreement means that users of azureus ' zudeo software in the us can download titles such as little britain .
until now , most bbc programmes found on peer-to-peer file-sharing networks have been illegal copies .
beth clearfield , vice president of programme management and digital media at bbc worldwide , said that the agreement was part of a drive to reach the largest audience possible .
" we are very excited to partner with azureus and make our content available through this revolutionary distribution model , " she said .
high definition azureus is best known for developing a bittorrent client , or program , that allows large media files to be easily shared over the internet .
the program has been downloaded more than 130 million times .
once you have watched a show , you can rate it , comment on it and recommend it to a friend gilles bianrosa , azureus earlier this month the company launched a video sharing site similar to youtube , codenamed zudeo .
the site allows users to upload and view content .
however , in contrast to most video sharing sites , zudeo offers high definition videos .
users must also download a program to access and upload content .
the new deal means that users of the software will be able to download high-quality versions of bbc programmes , including red dwarf , doctor who and the league of gentleman .
classic series such as fawlty towers will also be available through a bbc " channel " .
the titles will be protected by digital rights management software to prevent the programmes being traded illegally on the internet .
" this will be a very different experience from traditional file-sharing networks , " said gilles bianrosa , ceo of azureus .
users will also be able to link to programmes from blogs , social networks and fansites .
" if you have zudeo running it will take you to that programme ; and if you do n't , it will suggest you install it , like the first time you download a flash movie , " said mr bianrosa .
" once you have watched a show , you can rate it , comment on it and recommend it to a friend . "
mr bianrosa believes the cult status of many bbc programmes will make these features appealing to zudeo users .
legal services file-sharing is often associated with illegal distribution of copyrighted content .
but in recent months a number of networks have tried to shake off this old image .
bittorrent , the company behind the original file-sharing software of the same name , has recently signed a number of deals with content providers , such as 20th century fox , in a bid to become a legitimate download service .
earlier this year , sharman networks , the owners of kazaa , did similar deals .
kazaa uses advertising to provide content for free .
no pricing structure for the bbc content on zudeo has been revealed .
azureus is expected to announce other partnerships in the new year .

the anglers conservation association -lrb- aca -rrb- is now considering legal action if measures are not taken to protect fish such as salmon and trout .
the organisation says the existing fish pass built into the 10-year-old barrage does not adequately protect fish from foraging seals .
british waterways , which manages the barrage , has promised to mount a study into ways of improving the situation .
aca solicitor guy lilley allen , said : " the problem with the barrage is the salmon and sea trout are trying to run up the river , coming up to the barrage and are being delayed because they can not find the very small opening of the fish pass and consequently seals are having an absolute feast .
water quality " the seal population is increasing just in front of the barrage because they know they 're on to a good thing with the fish being held up .
" the simple solution is to build a new fish pass to get them past the barrage more quickly . "
a british waterways spokesman said : " the whole of the barrage is operated as a fish pass by bw staff who operate the locks and the barrage gates to allow migrating trout and salmon to pass upstream .
" undoubtedly improved water quality has led to an increase in migratory salmon and sea trout travelling back up the tees estuary and this has led in turn to increases in the sightings of predatory mammals such as seals .
" the activities of these predatory species are almost certainly impacting on the salmon and coarse fish populations and the environment agency have recommended detailed and lengthy scientific survey work .
" only then can we understand how significant these impacts are . "

aca solicitor guy lilley allen , said : " the problem with the barrage is the salmon and sea trout are trying to run up the river , coming up to the barrage and are being delayed because they can not find the very small opening of the fish pass and consequently seals are having an absolute feast .
water quality " the seal population is increasing just in front of the barrage because they know they 're on to a good thing with the fish being held up .
" the simple solution is to build a new fish pass to get them past the barrage more quickly . "
a british waterways spokesman said : " the whole of the barrage is operated as a fish pass by bw staff who operate the locks and the barrage gates to allow migrating trout and salmon to pass upstream .
" undoubtedly improved water quality has led to an increase in migratory salmon and sea trout travelling back up the tees estuary and this has led in turn to increases in the sightings of predatory mammals such as seals .
" the activities of these predatory species are almost certainly impacting on the salmon and coarse fish populations and the environment agency have recommended detailed and lengthy scientific survey work .
" only then can we understand how significant these impacts are . "

no incidents were reported in a part of the kingdom which piloted the nominated neighbour scheme during the summer .
people in the rest of the region were conned out of £ 40,000 during the three-month trial period .
under the scheme , residents hold up a yellow card when an unknown person comes to their door .
the caller is directed to a neighbour 's house , where someone can double-check their identity .
if the caller is genuine , the neighbour accompanies them back to the elderly or vulnerable person 's home and waits while they carry out their business .
' advance notice ' fife user panels is an organisation which helps shape policy for elderly people living alone in the area .
co-ordinator jessie watt told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " older people have a right and a need to feel safe and secure in their own homes , and be confident that when they open their door , it is to someone they want to speak to .
" many tell me that it would be better if home services , when there is a change of personnel , give advance notice to contribute to this feeling of safety .
" local authorities and service providers do say that this should happen , but sometimes short notice it is not always easy to get in touch with people . "
she added : " it would be particularly helpful for those who have lost their sight , or hearing , as it would allow them to be prepared and have someone with them when a new caller arrives . "

wimpey said it expected uk completions to reach record levels in 2006 , while prices continued to rise .
but problems in the us have prompted the group to write off land deals worth around $ 1m and slow future land purchases in all states except texas .
despite its us problems , wimpey expects full year profits to meet forecasts .
looking ahead , wimpey said it remained cautious about the us market , adding it would hold off on further land purchases amid belief that prices could fall further .
the us property market has been going through a slump , with annual spending on new housing down 17.4 % in the third quarter of 2006 , according to official figures .
meanwhile , applications to build new homes fell for the 10th month in a row in november .
but wimpey 's prospects were significantly better in the uk .
its uk forward order book for 2007 stood at £ 763m -lrb- $ 1.5bn -rrb- - a 10 % increase by volume and 11 % by value compared with the same time last year .
uk house prices surged this year despite two rate rises by the bank of england .

wimpey said it expected uk completions to reach record levels in 2006 , while prices continued to rise .
but problems in the us have prompted the group to write off land deals worth around $ 1m and slow future land purchases in all states except texas .
despite its us problems , wimpey expects full year profits to meet forecasts .
looking ahead , wimpey said it remained cautious about the us market , adding it would hold off on further land purchases amid belief that prices could fall further .
the us property market has been going through a slump , with annual spending on new housing down 17.4 % in the third quarter of 2006 , according to official figures .
meanwhile , applications to build new homes fell for the 10th month in a row in november .
but wimpey 's prospects were significantly better in the uk .
its uk forward order book for 2007 stood at £ 763m -lrb- $ 1.5bn -rrb- - a 10 % increase by volume and 11 % by value compared with the same time last year .

manu sharma , son of former federal minister venod sharma , was convicted of shooting jessica lal dead in delhi .
the case was reopened after he and eight others were acquitted in february , prompting a public outcry .
campaigners say media pressure over the case has encouraged the courts to take on india 's rich and powerful . "
i am really happy with the judgement .
i really could not ask for more " jessica lal 's sister , sabrina india 's elite feel courts ' heat the delhi high court also ordered sharma to pay 50,000 rupees -lrb- $ 1,100 -rrb- in compensation to jessica lal 's family .
" the court said since it was not a pre-planned murder , manu sharma will serve a life sentence , " rd rana , one of sharma 's lawyers , told reporters .
the prosecution had demanded that sharma be sentenced to death .
two of his friends , vikas yadav , the son of another politician , and amardeep singh gill , a former manager with coca cola , were sentenced to four years in jail for destroying evidence .
" i am really happy with the judgement .
i really could not ask for more , " the murdered model 's sister , sabrina lal , told reporters after the sentencing .
manu sharma 's lawyers say they plan to appeal against his conviction in the supreme court .
' conspiracy ' prosecutors said manu sharma fired at jessica lal after she refused to serve him a drink at a fashionable restaurant in the capital where she was working as a waitress .
several eyewitnesses came forward to the police , but by the time the case came to trial seven years later key eyewitnesses had retracted their statements .
the trial finally collapsed in february 2006 when the lower court judge said the prosecution 's case contained loopholes and there was insufficient evidence to convict .
the acquittals sparked public outrage , with protest rallies and a sustained media campaign launched to demand justice for jessica lal , who was 34 when she was killed .
police appealed against the acquittals and opened an investigation into allegations that there had been a conspiracy to pervert justice .
several witnesses and police officials involved in the case were questioned .
campaigners said it had been the latest in a long line of cases where members of india 's elite had been able to manipulate the law and get away with murder .
but the pressure mounted over the jessica lal case is seen as a turning point in efforts to bring the rich to justice .
observers say the sustained media campaigns and public protests resulted in other cases being reopened and convictions secured .
in october , the son of a former senior policeman was convicted of raping and murdering delhi student priyardishini mattoo in 1996 .
earlier this month , former indian cricketer navjot sidhu was sentenced to three years in prison for manslaughter after beating a man in a dispute over a parking space .
his acquittal , too , was overturned on appeal .

several eyewitnesses came forward to the police , but by the time the case came to trial seven years later key eyewitnesses had retracted their statements .
the trial finally collapsed in february 2006 when the lower court judge said the prosecution 's case contained loopholes and there was insufficient evidence to convict .
the acquittals sparked public outrage , with protest rallies and a sustained media campaign launched to demand justice for jessica lal , who was 34 when she was killed .
prosecutors said ms lal was shot for refusing to serve a drink police appealed against the acquittals and opened an investigation into allegations that there had been a conspiracy to pervert justice .
several witnesses and police officials involved in the case were questioned .
campaigners said it had been the latest in a long line of cases where members of india 's elite had been able to manipulate the law and get away with murder .
but the pressure mounted over the jessica lal case is seen as a turning point in efforts to bring the rich to justice .
observers say the sustained media campaigns and public protests resulted in other cases being reopened and convictions secured .
in october , the son of a former senior policeman was convicted of raping and murdering delhi student priyardishini mattoo in 1996 .
earlier this month , former indian cricketer navjot sidhu was sentenced to three years in prison for manslaughter after beating a man in a dispute over a parking space .
his acquittal , too , was overturned on appeal .
