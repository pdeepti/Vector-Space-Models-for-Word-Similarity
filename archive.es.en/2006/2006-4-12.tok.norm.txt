that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .

with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation .

voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .

" it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair .

" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .

with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "

he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election posters can come down , despite the current standstill rome-based political scientist james walston questioned what might happen if the stalemate continued , particularly given that one of the first duties of the new parliament will be to elect a new state president . " the nightmare scenario is that if we do n't have a government by may 18 , when president -lrb- carlo azeglio -rrb- ciampi 's mandate is up , then we do n't have a head of state either , " walston said . " that is a possibility if berlusconi does really stop everything , " he said .
" then things will really get interesting .

" we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .

in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer .

he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .

" the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election posters can come down , despite the current standstill rome-based political scientist james walston questioned what might happen if the stalemate continued , particularly given that one of the first duties of the new parliament will be to elect a new state president . " the nightmare scenario is that if we do n't have a government by may 18 , when president -lrb- carlo azeglio -rrb- ciampi 's mandate is up , then we do n't have a head of state either , " walston said . " that is a possibility if berlusconi does really stop everything , " he said .
" then things will really get interesting .

voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair . " we call on iran to respect its obligations and comply with the demands of the international atomic energy agency and the un security council , " cope said . iran should re-establish a " relationship of trust " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei will be negotiating in tehran this week " the announcement by the iranian authorities of the activation of 164 centrifuges is worrying , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said in a statement .
" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2006 opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler in madagascar : africa also has success stories horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair .

" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2006 italy facing weeks of uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's the official winner , but berlusconi wo n't concede analysts say italy will have to cope with weeks of political and economic uncertainty as prime minister berlusconi rejected a general election result .
but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election posters can come down , despite the current standstill rome-based political scientist james walston questioned what might happen if the stalemate continued , particularly given that one of the first duties of the new parliament will be to elect a new state president . " the nightmare scenario is that if we do n't have a government by may 18 , when president -lrb- carlo azeglio -rrb- ciampi 's mandate is up , then we do n't have a head of state either , " walston said .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair . " we call on iran to respect its obligations and comply with the demands of the international atomic energy agency and the un security council , " cope said . iran should re-establish a " relationship of trust " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei will be negotiating in tehran this week " the announcement by the iranian authorities of the activation of 164 centrifuges is worrying , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said in a statement .
" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2006 italy facing weeks of uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's the official winner , but berlusconi wo n't concede analysts say italy will have to cope with weeks of political and economic uncertainty as prime minister berlusconi rejected a general election result .
but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election posters can come down , despite the current standstill rome-based political scientist james walston questioned what might happen if the stalemate continued , particularly given that one of the first duties of the new parliament will be to elect a new state president . " the nightmare scenario is that if we do n't have a government by may 18 , when president -lrb- carlo azeglio -rrb- ciampi 's mandate is up , then we do n't have a head of state either , " walston said . " that is a possibility if berlusconi does really stop everything , " he said .
" then things will really get interesting .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .

they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .

with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .

" the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair . " we call on iran to respect its obligations and comply with the demands of the international atomic energy agency and the un security council , " cope said . iran should re-establish a " relationship of trust " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei will be negotiating in tehran this week " the announcement by the iranian authorities of the activation of 164 centrifuges is worrying , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said in a statement .
" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2006 opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler in madagascar : africa also has success stories horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues .
-lrb- april 3 , 2006 -rrb- eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german president seeks " real partnership " with africa german president horst köhler called sunday for a " true partnership " between the west and africa as he kicked off an initiative to solve the continent 's urgent problems .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair . " we call on iran to respect its obligations and comply with the demands of the international atomic energy agency and the un security council , " cope said . iran should re-establish a " relationship of trust " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei will be negotiating in tehran this week " the announcement by the iranian authorities of the activation of 164 centrifuges is worrying , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said in a statement .
" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .
it 's not a florida-type situation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election posters can come down , despite the current standstill rome-based political scientist james walston questioned what might happen if the stalemate continued , particularly given that one of the first duties of the new parliament will be to elect a new state president . " the nightmare scenario is that if we do n't have a government by may 18 , when president -lrb- carlo azeglio -rrb- ciampi 's mandate is up , then we do n't have a head of state either , " walston said . " that is a possibility if berlusconi does really stop everything , " he said .
" then things will really get interesting .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .

they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .

in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

the catholic church in germany has protested , saying it will try to persuade mtv not to air the show . father nicolas , a clerk at the vatican caters to an infantile pope who loves horror movies and pogo sticks .
he tries to stay righteous in spite of his attraction to vixen sister penelope and the evil machinations of three money-obsessed cardinals . it 's a cartoon series called " popetown , " a parody of the vatican .
and it is so controversial that the catholic church in germany , where it is to be aired in may , is already trying to persuade mtv not to air the show . " we have not given up hope that dialogue with the direction of mtv will lead to a decision to cancel the screening of the series and to consideration for the feelings of christians in our country , " the german bishop 's conference , the catholic church 's highest office in the country , said in a statement . it said it would also complain to the relevant authorities about an advertisement for the cartoon series , saying it mocked the christian faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict would most likely not be amused by " popetown " " mtv 's advertisement for ' popetown ' in several television programming magazines constitutes a provocation for germany 's christians just a few days before good friday and easter , " a statement said . the advertisement , which shows a laughing man with a crown of thorns watching television , " mocked and ridiculed the central tenets of the christian faith , " it added . too controversial the latest cartoon to court controversy because of its irreverent take on religion , " popetown " was originally produced for the bbc but the british broadcaster decided in 2004 not to screen it because it was too controversial . referring to the recent controversy over the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers , joachim herrmann , a leader of the bavaria-only christian social union party , said mtv would have thought twice about poking fun at muslim clerics in a similar way . " i demand that the broadcaster stop trampling on the religious feelings of christians , and to shelve the program as well as the tasteless advertisement , " herrmann said .
" it is not acceptable that the christian faith in particular is dragged into the dirt just because it is easier and less dangerous , " he added . bildunterschrift : sister penelope doubles as a journalist in the show mtv plans to start screening the 10-part series , which is billed as the story of a " crazy pope " running a deeply corrupt state , in austria , germany and switzerland on may 3 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the series depicts an infantile pontiff earlier on monday , germany 's lay catholics also protested against the planned " popetown " season and the advertisement . " we call on all christians in germany to join our call that the series ' popetown ' should not be shown , " the central committee of german catholics said . it called the advertisement a " repulsive mockery of the catholic church " and an attack on the christian faith . a spokesman for mtv in berlin said the catholic group had on monday threatened legal action unless the music channel cancelled the series . " so far we do not have any plans to change our schedule .
we will still start screening on may 3 , " he told afp . pope benedict xvi , the former cardinal joseph ratzinger , was born in the southern german state of bavaria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2006 opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler in madagascar : africa also has success stories horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2006 opinion : helping africa is europe 's political and moral duty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohler in madagascar : africa also has success stories horst köhler is convinced that africa 's ideas will solve africa 's problem .
that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .
" they have a very slim majority in the senate , and in the chamber -lrb- of deputies -rrb- .
they will be exposed to constant attack by the opposition , who can claim the support of half the country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi is certain of his victory political analyst andrea vannucci said it would only take one bout of flu to erase the prodi alliance 's one or possibly two-seat majority in the 315-seat upper house . for that reason , the center-left coalition would likely forego the privilege of retaining the post of senate speaker , who is not allowed to vote , vannucci said . " it was a polite habit up until about 10 years ago to hand it to the opposition , " vannucci said . italy is n't germany analysts discounted an apparent overture by the 69-year-old prime minister to prodi about forming a german-style " grand coalition " to share power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could prodi and berlusconi work together ?
probably not , say analysts " it 's a good thing for him to say because it makes it seem like he 's the one seeking national harmony , " d 'altimonte said . " but this is not germany , this is italy , and you have to ask where the refoundation communists would fit in , " d 'altimonte said .
" can prodi afford to leave them out ?
could berlusconi work with them ? " us-style recount is unlikely in italy vannucci said berlusconi 's brinkmanship was unlikely to derail the new government .
the prospect of a us-style recount drama was remote in italy . " the recount idea is an obvious move by berlusconi given the closeness of the vote , " he said .
" it 's very unlikely it will change anything , because of the strength of the italian system .

but the prospect of a us-style recount drama is n't likely in italy . prime minister silvio berlusconi has demanded a recount of thousands of disputed ballots in the last gamble of a rollercoaster election in italy .
voters this week handed power to his center-left rival romano prodi in the tightest election in living memory .
a margin of just 25,000 votes contributed to prodi 's victory . " what can possibly happen that has n't already ? " said roberto d 'altimonte , a political scientist at florence university .
" well , this is italy , so anything can happen . " the prospect of an extended battle over the outcome of the vote threw up the possibility of a lengthy delay in naming the new government .
it put prodi 's priority of reviving a dilapidated economy on the back burner . " we 're now going to have a legal battle on the recounting of the contested ballots , so i expect the uncertainty to continue , " d 'altimonte said .
he said it could take weeks , depending on what berlusconi wanted to recount - the contested 43,000 ballots or the entirety of the invalid ballots . d 'altimonte said a large proportion of the one million ballots declared invalid in the election for the lower house were considered " spoiled " in the first count by polling monitors for both coalitions .
but they could also now be subject to recount . the rest is made up of the " contested " ballots - on whose validity party monitors could not agree - and blank ballots . a bout of flu could erase the majority james newell , an italian politics specialist at salford university , said the razor-thin margin of prodi 's victory troubled him . " it leaves us with a government with little legitimacy , " newell said .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .

with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "
the us magazine paid tribute to 37 people who spoke up for others . but with the world cup coming to germany this year , the grönemeyer name has n't gone unnoticed by the fifa .
the soccer association has asked him to write the official hymn for the event . the piece is already finished and is called " celebrate the day . "
it will be released in several languages and grönemeyer will sing it personally at the world cup 's official opening in munich on june 9 . petra lambeck -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .

with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .

but they hope iran will still adhere to a un security council deadline . germany 's deputy government spokesman thomas steg said iran must suspend all uranium enrichment work , as stipulated in a un security council resolution last month . " we are deeply concerned about these reports of the supposedly successful start of enrichment activities , " steg told reporters on wednesday . " we can only say that this is a further step in the wrong direction .
iran is apparently not prepared to abandon the road to isolation , " steg said , echoing criticism from the united states and russia . the french government shared germany 's sentiments . " these declarations are rather a step in the wrong direction , " government spokesman jean-francois cope said .
he said france was aiming for a diplomatic settlement to the affair . " we call on iran to respect its obligations and comply with the demands of the international atomic energy agency and the un security council , " cope said . iran should re-establish a " relationship of trust " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's mohamed elbaradei will be negotiating in tehran this week " the announcement by the iranian authorities of the activation of 164 centrifuges is worrying , " french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said in a statement .
" if this announcement were confirmed , it would go directly against the repeated demands made by the iaea and the united nations security council . " the minister said france was awaiting the conclusions of a mission to iran by iaea head mohamed elbaradei , who leaves for tehran wednesday . " once again , i firmly urge iran to suspend its dangerous activities in order to re-establish a relationship of trust with the international community , " douste-blazy said . waiting for a " reliable signal " germany has been working with the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - to convince tehran to freeze its enrichment program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the five permanent members of the un security council are aiming for a peaceful solution german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger said wednesday the negotiations had reached a " difficult phase . " he said the partners were waiting for a " reliable signal " that tehran was willing to meet the un security council deadline to freeze its enrichment activities , which runs out this month . jäger added that germany still believed that a russian proposal to enrich uranium for iran on russian soil could be " an important element of a possible solution . " in an elaborate ceremony tuesday , the islamic regime declared its scientists had managed to enrich uranium to make reactor fuel , in direct contravention of the un security council demand for such work to stop . this process , which can be extended to make weapons-grade uranium , is the focus of fears that iran could acquire weapons of mass destruction .
tehran has consistently denied the charge . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies un with nuclear breakthrough iran announced tuesday it had successfully enriched uranium to make nuclear fuel , a dramatic breakthrough in its disputed atomic drive that defies a un security council demand for the work to be halted .

but music is n't his only passion .
grönemeyer is actively involved in getting poverty and development aid back on the political agenda . herbert grönemeyer is celebrating his 50th birthday on wednesday in a manner true to his character : low-key .
no public celebrations , probably just a quiet dinner with friends and family in his adopted home , london . grönemeyer is one of germany 's best-known stars .
for over 25 years , he has rocked through the german music scene and wo n't be stepping down anytime soon .
he 's currently putting together a new album , expected to be released next year . grönemeyer 's success story began in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his first two albums were a flop - the first winning a prize for the ugliest cover of the year .
but he finally landed his big breakthrough with the song " männer " or " men . "
for his fans , it became the ultimate cult song . men are " super strong " and " can do everything " ; they " buy women " yet " secretly cry . "
grönemeyer caricatured the male superhero who , when it comes down to it , is still just a human being .
the accompanying album stayed in the top 100 of the charts for 79 weeks and became an unprecedented sales success for a german rock singer . " mensch " clinched grönemeyer 's comeback at the end of the 1990s , it became quieter around grönemeyer for some time , following severe strokes of fate in his personal life .
in november 1998 , he lost both his brother wilhelm and his wife anna to cancer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer won the " eins live krone " award for " mensch " grönemeyer disappeared for a while from the public eye .
in this time , he wrote the songs for his album " mensch " or " human , " which sealed his comeback four years later . " mensch " became a huge success , selling over three million copies .
with its single of the same name , grönemeyer climbed to the top of the german single charts for the first time . singing for africa grönemeyer is n't known just for his music , but also for his political work .
he 's a person who likes to voice his opinion and is not one to mince words . the 50-year-old takes a stand on political issues in many of his songs .
his lyrics oppose nuclear power and racism , and call for tolerance and peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grönemeyer was also part of the live 8 concert in berlin last year grönemeyer is also actively involved in development projects for africa .
together with fellow german musician wolfgang niedecken , he wrote the german song for the first live aid concert over 20 years ago . today , he 's head of the action group " your voice against poverty , " the german branch of bob geldof 's initiative " make poverty history . " the campaign 's goal is to make people aware of the poverty issue and exert pressure on government leaders .
they are supposed to do more for development aid in order to meet the united nations ' millennium goals for battling poverty .
for grönemeyer , this is a question of humanity and solidarity . " together , we have the power to change things and the time to act , to wake up , to give the world a new twist is now , " grönemeyer said .
" if we do n't face up to this task now , we will have to live with the lifelong disgrace of not having done those things which were possible to really defeat poverty , illness , hunger and death .
and future generations will measure us by this . " grönemeyer is supplying the world cup hymn his social actions have also made grönemeyer internationally known .
his face was on the front of a special edition of time last october under the headline " european heroes 2005 . "

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

the announcement on tuesday provided an early snapshot of the strategy of the newly merged company just three months after adidas acquired reebok in a four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- deal finalized in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adidas is making the new jersey for germany 's national soccer team adidas will concentrate on team sports , leaving reebok activities such as aerobics , gym wear and running apparel .

that conviction marked the choice of countries he visited during his second trip to the continent as germany 's president . the reforms in mozambique , madagascar and botswana are exemplary for the continent .
in mozambique , civil war has been overcome and decisive policies are being employed to combat poverty and improve the educational system .
in madagascar , the president has prescribed strict economic reforms , has pressed forward with improving the infrastructure and providing utilities for the countryside and has made the environment his top priority .
in botswana , the political leadership handles the country 's rich resources responsibly , and there 's free healthcare and a social welfare system .
it has the lowest level of corruption on the continent - even ranking above italy , greece and portugal in that respect - and since independence four years ago , it has been a stabile democracy . if such reform politics were the norm in africa , there would not only be fewer catastrophes and wars on the continent ; then africa might even have left its neighbor , dogged old europe , behind in some respects .
in any case , africa would generate different headlines than it now does as well as a different perception of it from europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is vital president köhler wants good news from africa , and he wants his trips to spread the message .
he wants to use the three countries to show that the eagerness to reform can be felt all over , and that in africa politics is often more pragmatic and fast than elsewhere when it comes to reversing developmental backwardness . elites are key the president has his role in africa .
he can resume discussions where he left off as head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
he can freely and directly address political abuses - and he 's valued by his interlocutors .
back home in germany , köhler 's political comments are often heavily criticized - whether the issue is congo or labor market policies .
in africa , he 's viewed as a friend and welcomed with respect and trust . as köhler was frequently told during his visit , germany also has an especially good reputation there .
the germans are considered to be strong and decisive , the madegascan president told his german colleague - a positive image that stands in glaring contrast to the generally negative image of africa in germany . why has botswana achieved that which angola or congo - also rich in resources - have failed to do ?
why is it that a country like mozambique , still one of the 10 poorest in the world , achieves average growth of 8 percent ?
the key to success is the elites .
if they take political responsibility , their countries can be led out of poverty and war . europe must cha n ge , too that 's why köhler sees education as key to development .
but köhler is also convinced that enduring changes ca n't be made if industrialized countries do n't change their politics .
that goes for world trade as well as for the reckless and interest-led exploitation of raw materials on the african continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : botswana 's diamond mines have turned it into an economic success köhler 's arguments go far beyond simple cost-benefit calculations .
the situation in the democratic republic of congo and in sudan and the growing number of refugees who strand on italy 's shores are n't alone in showing that the crises and conflicts in africa threaten europe 's security and prosperity . what 's more important to the german president is that the poverty , desperation and death in africa repudiate european values .
africa is a political necessity to him and a moral duty for europe .
köhler brings it to a head with a question that european foreign policy has n't yet answered : what remains of european values in an increasingly globalized world , if europe continues to leave africa aside . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .
during visits to mozambique , madagascar and botswana , the german leader will promote better understanding of african issues .

germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .

jeremy colman 's report found nhs overspend , combined with previous debts , came to a total of £ 114m .
more than half of the £ 82m of previous debts will have to be paid off before 2009 , worsening the financial situation of the welsh nhs , he warned .
deputy welsh health minister john griffiths said a " deficit culture " within the nhs was being tackled .
in his report , mr colman said " short-term financial pressures " were preventing the nhs from resolving its long-standing deficits .
summary findings local health boards mostly expected to meet 2005-2006 budget limits , with overall £ 4m surplus most nhs trusts forecast deficits , with £ 26m overspend estimated health commission wales forecast £ 10m deficit estimates in december showed an improvement on previous forecasts , with total net deficit of £ 32m by march 2006 source : auditor general for wales , is the nhs in wales managing within its available resources ?
the report recommends an " all-wales analysis " is carried out , examining how well nhs finances are managed .
mr colman said : " while the exercise of financial control has improved , there is a worrying downward trend in the financial position of the nhs in wales .
" recovery plans must be realistic with effective reporting procedures .
it must be quite clear where responsibilities for action lie and who is accountable for delivery .
" most of all , the underlying reasons for the deficit must be addressed . "
effective links in addition to the £ 82m of previous debt , the study found the nhs overspent by £ 32m last year .
this figure is combination of a £ 26m overspend predicted by nhs trusts , and a deficit of £ 10m forecast by health commission wales .
but the total is offset by local health boards in wales , which are predicting an overall surplus of £ 4m .
the report questions whether there have been effective links between the " strategic direction " of the nhs and the implementation of local plans .
' enormous debts ' in march , the welsh assembly government confirmed the nhs in wales would end the financial year £ 71m in debt .
we are determined that we will have better financial management within the nhs in wales john griffiths , deputy welsh health minister but health minister brian gibbons said the figure was 2 % of annual turnover , which was " manageable " .
deputy welsh health minister john griffiths told bbc radio wales the assembly government 's handling of the nhs had produced " continuous improvement " but said he was " concerned " with financial management within the nhs .
he said : " we 've got more doctors and nurses , better equipment , better buildings , waiting times have been driven down .

" their has been a deficit culture for quite some time and we are determined to eradicate it .
" we 'll be agreeing plans with -lrb- the nhs -rrb- to make sure these deficits are wiped out . "
mr griffiths added he did not think job cuts were likely to reduce the deficit .
richard lewis , welsh secretary of the british medical association , said the inherited debt was a " real handicap to the nhs moving forward positively " .
dr lewis said health service managers who had such " enormous debts " hanging over them would not be able to concentrate on how best to look after patients , " despite their best efforts " .

the south east england development agency -lrb- seeda -rrb- names brighton and hove and urban south hampshire as " two diamonds for growth " .
and seaside towns from whitstable to cowes , including hastings and bexhill , are described as a " string of pearls " that can narrow economic gaps .
the idea will be discussed at a coastal cities summit in brighton on 16 may .
" the coastal area is rich in diversity and potential , " said a seeda spokesman . "
the potential of the coastal area is huge " seeda chairman , james brathwaite and it said that many projects were already under way .
deputy prime minister john prescott said the summit in brighton would be " an important opportunity " .
commenting on the announcement of the coastal plan , he said it would mean " looking afresh at the economic contours of a region " .
mr prescott said : " it 's about thinking east-west not just north-south .

a quiet man of simple tastes twenty and some years have passed since george left us and i have only recently begun to understand the man that my grandfather was .
i wish i had known him better .
send us your views a gordon highlander , captured at st valery en caux in france along with the remainder of the 51st highland division and like many other men of his generation , he suffered at the hands of his enemies , both at the time and for the rest of his life .
he shared little of the pain inflicted upon him as a prisoner of war .
george was a quiet man of simple tastes who loved his children and his grandchildren .

he placed one-half of it back in his wallet and he handed me the other ; " when you are a man and you come back , we 'll join these two halves together and we will have a drink , okay " i can still remember the tears welling up in his eyes as he spoke .
we never did share that drink .

so with two months to go , how is the warm welcome shaping up ?
by adopting " a time to make friends " as the tournament slogan , world cup organisers want national stereotypes lingering since world war ii to be smothered under a friendly embrace .
much of this responsibility will fall on berlin , which is to host five matches plus the final in its remodelled olympiastadion , the venue for the 1936 nazi-era olympics .
the tournament 's opening ceremony is on 7 june at the brandenburg gate - the symbol of the city and its divided past .
brandenburg gate souvenirs are joined by football memorabilia and with weeks to go , traditional berlin souvenirs have fresh competition in the shape of t-shirts , caps , cushions and even umbrellas for the participating football teams .
but on the city streets , there are few signs one of the world 's biggest tournaments is on the horizon .
" they do n't go mad about football like they do in england .
it 's a typical berlin thing , " says gary taylor , 35 , who has lived in berlin for five years and works in a souvenir shop on unter den linden , near the gate .
" they do n't get very excited about anything .
it 's a very laid-back city so they do n't go over-the-top like in cologne or munich . "
we can be a little bit rude but we have big hearts berliner martina fampel taxi drivers , arguably the best barometer of a city 's sensibilities , explain the muted atmosphere by saying there are fears amongst berliners about the impending arrival of hundreds of thousands of people .
recalling conversations with passengers , martina fampel , 44 , says : " some of them are worried about all the people coming here , the hooligans or the people drinking too much and making difficulties .
" for me it 's not interesting who the winner is , but i think it will be a big party and just about having fun .
" berlin will do a great job .
we think we are a little bit special , we can be a little bit rude , but we have big hearts . "
germany 's image is not that good and we want to show we 're not as bad as people think julia kienbaum berlin tourism another taxi driver said he was planning to leave the city for a month to get away from the crowds .
he added that restrictions on how close taxis could drive to the stadiums on match days would affect business .
there are a few hints of the party ahead , such as a 32-metre football which adorns the city 's highest building , the fernsehturm , and a giant " kicker " football game in the city centre .
there is also plenty going on behind the scenes , as organisers strive to fulfil their friendly pledge .
' prussian discipline ' julia kienbaum , a berlin tourism marketing spokeswoman , says : " germany 's image is not that good and we want to show we 're not as bad as people think .
berlin 's highest tower gets a makeover " people think of germans as very serious and they still have a bad impression because of the second world war , brutal prussian discipline and the idea we want to be the leaders of the world . "
with this in mind , tournament organisers have taken the unusual step of encouraging fans without tickets to travel to germany and watch the matches on dozens of big screens around the country , including nine screens in berlin .
the capital is well used to hosting large numbers of people - it has 600 hotels accommodating nearly two million foreign visitors a year .
for young people who can not get a bed , there is a " fan camp " in the capital with 2,000 tent spaces , and the city 's shops are permitted to trade for longer throughout the tournament .
there is also a mile of activities planned from the kulturforum to the reichstag -lrb- parliament building -rrb- , where a football theme park including a replica olympic stadium is being built .
tabloid hype the test for whether the tournament 's mission statement succeeds may lie with germany 's biggest rivals , england , who are thought to be bringing one of the largest contingents of fans , an estimated 100,000 .
table football with a big difference the majority will be coming to the country for the first time , a fact travel experts in the uk blame on negative imagery about the war .
this perception is intensified by british tabloid newspapers eager to portray any match between england and germany as world war iii .
but a happy experience in germany for so many english people could begin to change attitudes .
the hosts have even hired their former nemesis , england 's 1966 world cup hero geoff hurst , to front a campaign to entice tourists from the uk .
christoph biermann , football writer at munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung , is amazed that events 60 years ago could still shape people 's thinking .
all the same , he believes germany will welcome england because the two cultures have a lot in common .
" in germany the image of england football supporters has changed .
i saw how well-behaved they were in portugal .
" sun protection seems to be an alien concept for a lot of them and they like to drink at 10 o 'clock in the morning , but that 's ok if they do n't hit passers-by .

there are a few hints of the party ahead , such as a 32-metre football which adorns the city 's highest building , the fernsehturm , and a giant " kicker " football game in the city centre .
there is also plenty going on behind the scenes , as organisers strive to fulfil their friendly pledge .
' prussian discipline ' julia kienbaum , a berlin tourism marketing spokeswoman , says : " germany 's image is not that good and we want to show we 're not as bad as people think .
" people think of germans as very serious and they still have a bad impression because of the second world war , brutal prussian discipline and the idea we want to be the leaders of the world . "
with this in mind , tournament organisers have taken the unusual step of encouraging fans without tickets to travel to germany and watch the matches on dozens of big screens around the country , including nine screens in berlin .
the capital is well used to hosting large numbers of people - it has 600 hotels accommodating nearly two million foreign visitors a year .
for young people who can not get a bed , there is a " fan camp " in the capital with 2,000 tent spaces , and the city 's shops are permitted to trade for longer throughout the tournament .
there is also a mile of activities planned from the kulturforum to the reichstag -lrb- parliament building -rrb- , where a football theme park including a replica olympic stadium is being built .
tabloid hype the test for whether the tournament 's mission statement succeeds may lie with germany 's biggest rivals , england , who are thought to be bringing one of the largest contingents of fans , an estimated 100,000 .
the majority will be coming to the country for the first time , a fact travel experts in the uk blame on negative imagery about the war .
this perception is intensified by british tabloid newspapers eager to portray any match between england and germany as world war iii .
but a happy experience in germany for so many english people could begin to change attitudes .
the hosts have even hired their former nemesis , england 's 1966 world cup hero geoff hurst , to front a campaign to entice tourists from the uk .
christoph biermann , football writer at munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung , is amazed that events 60 years ago could still shape people 's thinking .
all the same , he believes germany will welcome england because the two cultures have a lot in common .
" in germany the image of england football supporters has changed .
i saw how well-behaved they were in portugal .
" sun protection seems to be an alien concept for a lot of them and they like to drink at 10 o 'clock in the morning , but that 's ok if they do n't hit passers-by .
" that 's what a lot of people in germany understand .
they also drink a lot and sing , so in that respect germany and england are very close , and different from france , italy or spain . "

members of the aber and llanfairfechan graziers association took sheep from the carneddau range during the winter .
but they are returning them for summer grazing after allowing important wildlife habitats time to recover .
the pioneering scheme involving 22 graziers is the largest in wales , the countryside council for wales said .
the agreement , which also involves the snowdonia national park authority , was formally signed in march but graziers removed their stock from the mountain last winter in a good-will gesture .
on wednesday , graziers will return their sheep to the mountain to join the carneddau 's 120 wild ponies which are staying there all year round .
the graziers have been the custodians of this landscape for hundreds of years john lloyd jones , countryside council for wales two part-time shepherds have been employed to encourage the 7,700 sheep to graze the valleys in the summer so that the fragile habitats higher up the mountain are protected .
tudor jones , chairman of the graziers association , said he had already seen signs of rejuvenation .
" the upland vegetation is already looking better , and i 've spotted more grouse in the lower areas as well , which means that the heather must be healthier , " he said .
" i 'm also looking forward to our sheep doing well as they return to graze the common land , where the upland pastures have been rested , with only the ponies grazing them .
" the sheep 's food supply will be better than ever . "
most of the 2,700 hectares of common land are of european importance for wildlife and have been designated a special area of conservation -lrb- sac -rrb- .
landscape custodians they feature the fragile montane heath found only on the highest summits of the carneddau , upland heath , blanket bog as well as species rich grasslands .
grassy areas lower down are also important for the chough - a red-legged member of the crow family and one of snowdonia 's most distinctive rare birds .
councillor caerwyn roberts , chairman of the park authority , welcomed the agreement .
he said : " it will safeguard not only the incredibly valuable wildlife habitats of the carneddau , but will also ensure that traditional farming flourished in the area - the backbone of this rural community now , as it has been for many centuries " .
john lloyd jones , countryside council for wales chairman , said it showed the positive end result of designating the landscape an sac .
he said they had been able to attract £ 4.3m in objective one european funding for rhaglen tir eryri partnership which brings direct financial benefits to the graziers and local employment .
" the graziers have been the custodians of this landscape for hundreds of years .
this scheme supports their work into the future , " he added .

the italian researchers , who analysed data on 2,745 men , say more work is needed to establish a firm association .
however , they believe the key may be that cholesterol is used by the body to produce male hormones which have been linked to prostate cancer .
other experts said the annals of oncology study findings were plausible , but disputed the hormone theory . "
it suggests that people can do something themselves to reduce the chances of getting a disease which is among the biggest killers of men " professor nick james the researchers , from the istituto di ricerche farmacologiche mario negri in milan , admitted the study had to rely on patients reporting details of their own medical conditions .
however , they said the apparent association between high cholesterol and prostate cancer seemed to be a real one - particularly as the study uncovered no evidence of a link between the disease and ten other medical conditions .
the researchers examined data on 1,294 men with prostate cancer , and 1,451 men admitted to hospital with non-cancerous conditions .
they found men with prostate cancer were around 50 % more likely to have had high cholesterol levels .
the association was particularly strong among men diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 50 , and after the age of 65 .
both these groups were 80 % more likely to report high cholesterol levels than men free from cancer .
gallstones the analysis also found prostate cancer patients were 26 % more likely to have had gallstones .
thinner men appeared to be particularly vulnerable .
researcher dr cristina bosetti said : " androgens - hormones that have a role in prostate tissue and cancer - are synthesised from cholesterol , suggesting a possible biological relationship between high cholesterol and prostate cancer .
" gallstones are related to high cholesterol levels as well and are often composed of cholesterol .
" so , the direct relationship we found between gallstones and prostate cancer , while it was not statistically significant , suggests a similar biological mechanism may explain the link . "
dr bosetti said there was some evidence suggesting cholesterol-lowering statin drugs may help protect against prostate cancer .
however , she said studies investigating the link had so far been limited and inconclusive .
professor nick james , a cancer specialist at the university of birmingham , said it was " entirely plausible " that cholesterol was linked to prostate cancer .
he said : " there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting that diet is a factor in developing prostate cancer .
for instance , the disease is more common in northern european countries , where consumption of animals fats is relatively high .
" this research carries a positive message : it suggests that people can do something themselves to reduce the chances of getting a disease which is among the biggest killers of men . "
however , professor james was unconvinced by the idea that male hormones were key .
instead , he said some of the chemicals produced by the breakdown of cholesterol were known to be carcinogenic .
chris hiley , of the prostate cancer charity , said : " further research is needed to confirm this but in the meantime the health benefits of a varied diet are indisputable .
" we encourage men to cut down their intake of fatty foods and red and processed meat , but continue to eat oily fish and a high fibre diet with porridge oats , as well as plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables daily . "

however , they said the apparent association between high cholesterol and prostate cancer seemed to be a real one - particularly as the study uncovered no evidence of a link between the disease and ten other medical conditions .
the researchers examined data on 1,294 men with prostate cancer , and 1,451 men admitted to hospital with non-cancerous conditions .
they found men with prostate cancer were around 50 % more likely to have had high cholesterol levels .
the association was particularly strong among men diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 50 , and after the age of 65 .
both these groups were 80 % more likely to report high cholesterol levels than men free from cancer .
gallstones the analysis also found prostate cancer patients were 26 % more likely to have had gallstones .
thinner men appeared to be particularly vulnerable .
researcher dr cristina bosetti said : " androgens - hormones that have a role in prostate tissue and cancer - are synthesised from cholesterol , suggesting a possible biological relationship between high cholesterol and prostate cancer .
" gallstones are related to high cholesterol levels as well and are often composed of cholesterol .
" so , the direct relationship we found between gallstones and prostate cancer , while it was not statistically significant , suggests a similar biological mechanism may explain the link . "
dr bosetti said there was some evidence suggesting cholesterol-lowering statin drugs may help protect against prostate cancer .
however , she said studies investigating the link had so far been limited and inconclusive .
professor nick james , a cancer specialist at the university of birmingham , said it was " entirely plausible " that cholesterol was linked to prostate cancer .
he said : " there is a lot of circumstantial evidence suggesting that diet is a factor in developing prostate cancer .
for instance , the disease is more common in northern european countries , where consumption of animals fats is relatively high .
" this research carries a positive message : it suggests that people can do something themselves to reduce the chances of getting a disease which is among the biggest killers of men . "
however , professor james was unconvinced by the idea that male hormones were key .
instead , he said some of the chemicals produced by the breakdown of cholesterol were known to be carcinogenic .
chris hiley , of the prostate cancer charity , said : " further research is needed to confirm this but in the meantime the health benefits of a varied diet are indisputable .
" we encourage men to cut down their intake of fatty foods and red and processed meat , but continue to eat oily fish and a high fibre diet with porridge oats , as well as plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables daily . "

the grant from the european regional development fund will go towards a major revamp of newcastle 's hancock museum , including new galleries .
it means more than £ 24.5m of the £ 26m needed for the great north museum project has been secured .
four existing museums will be brought together under one roof and it is a key part of plans for a cultural quarter for the city centre 's northern area .
newcastle university dean of cultural affairs dr eric cross said : " with the imminent closure of the hancock museum to allow work on the development of the great north museum to begin in earnest , this news could not have come at a better time .

dartmoor wildlife park near plymouth has been on the market for 18 months but attempts to keep it intact have come to nothing .
owner ellis daw , 77 , who has run the park for 38 years , is retiring .
he says the park will close on 23 april and if a buyer is not found , some unsold animals will have to die .
those at risk include big cats - the park has six siberian tigers and five lions - flamingos , pelicans , porcupines , three bears and a pack of wolves .
there 's no reason why the park should n't carry on ellis daw the park can not be kept open to the public because mr daw will be handing in his zoo licence .
mr daw said : " we have been working on it and we have had quite a bit of luck placing the great majority so far , although there are a few very old ones which we do n't quite know about . "
mr daw said the park 's closure would certainly be the end of the line for spar , the 17-year-old king of the tiger enclosure .
" the only way for him if we were to close would be to shoot him , really , because no one else would take him at his age . "
he added : " there 's no reason why the park should n't carry on .
we get a lot of people here and we do a lot of education work .
it should go on .
" with a bit of extra effort i think it can be pulled off . "
mr daw , the owner of a successful timber firm , opened the park in 1968 on farmland his family bought after world war ii .
his aim was to give animals space to roam , after being horrified by zoo conditions during childhood visits in the 1920s .
in 2002 mr daw was given a conditional discharge after he admitted breeding tigers illegally and housing them in unsuitable conditions .
south hams district council , which issues zoo licences , said it would be be talking to mr daw about rehoming the animals .
ian bollans , head of environmental health , said : " there is a fairly supportive industry out there .
" i do n't think there will be a problem , but our primary concern is to see the animals rehoused to permanent locations . "

dartmoor wildlife park near plymouth has been on the market for 18 months but attempts to keep it intact have come to nothing .
owner ellis daw , 77 , who has run the park for 38 years , is retiring .
he says the park will close on 23 april and if a buyer is not found , some unsold animals will have to die .
those at risk include big cats - the park has six siberian tigers and five lions - flamingos , pelicans , porcupines , three bears and a pack of wolves .
there 's no reason why the park should n't carry on ellis daw the park can not be kept open to the public because mr daw will be handing in his zoo licence .
mr daw said : " we have been working on it and we have had quite a bit of luck placing the great majority so far , although there are a few very old ones which we do n't quite know about . "
mr daw said the park 's closure would certainly be the end of the line for spar , the 17-year-old king of the tiger enclosure .
" the only way for him if we were to close would be to shoot him , really , because no one else would take him at his age . "
he added : " there 's no reason why the park should n't carry on .
we get a lot of people here and we do a lot of education work .
it should go on .
" with a bit of extra effort i think it can be pulled off . "
mr daw , the owner of a successful timber firm , opened the park in 1968 on farmland his family bought after world war ii .
his aim was to give animals space to roam , after being horrified by zoo conditions during childhood visits in the 1920s .
in 2002 mr daw was given a conditional discharge after he admitted breeding tigers illegally and housing them in unsuitable conditions .
south hams district council , which issues zoo licences , said it would be be talking to mr daw about rehoming the animals .

the £ 2m windfall will run three projects across scotland to help parents and children with problems work towards law-abiding lifestyles .
the two-year initiatives in south lanarkshire , falkirk , and perth and kinross will also make use of parenting orders and asbos .
they will be based on the highly successful dundee families project .
justice minister cathy jamieson admitted there had been too much emphasis on supporting difficult families at the expense of communities in the past .
problem families the projects aim to break the cycle of offending by helping parents deal with the anti-social behaviour of their children .
but ms jamieson warned the move was not a soft option and that families would have to meet strict behaviour improvement targets .
speaking on a visit to the dundee project , which has earned an international reputation for its intensive work with problem families , she said : " a small number of families are responsible for most , and usually the most serious , anti-social behaviour in each community .
" their behaviour has a disproportionate affect on the community in which they live .
" dealing with their problems therefore helps not just those families - but the families who live next door , on the same stair , in the same street . "
the projects will bring health , housing and social work professionals together to monitor the families taking part .
intensive intervention carol , a single mother with three children , said the help she got from the dundee project , run by children 's charity nch scotland and the city council , saved her life .
" for the first time i felt somebody was interested in me and i almost handed over my life to them , " she said .
" they encouraged me to attend groups at the project and they offered advice and support in dealing with children , school , housing and neighbours . "
andrew girvan , director of children 's services for nch scotland , said its methods had reduced the need for evictions and prevented children from being taken into care .
" intensive intervention with the most challenging families will achieve the best outcomes - both for the families themselves and the wider community , " he said .

" their behaviour has a disproportionate affect on the community in which they live .
" dealing with their problems therefore helps not just those families - but the families who live next door , on the same stair , in the same street . "
the projects will bring health , housing and social work professionals together to monitor the families taking part .
intensive intervention carol , a single mother with three children , said the help she got from the dundee project , run by children 's charity nch scotland and the city council , saved her life .
" for the first time i felt somebody was interested in me and i almost handed over my life to them , " she said .
" they encouraged me to attend groups at the project and they offered advice and support in dealing with children , school , housing and neighbours . "
andrew girvan , director of children 's services for nch scotland , said its methods had reduced the need for evictions and prevented children from being taken into care .
" intensive intervention with the most challenging families will achieve the best outcomes - both for the families themselves and the wider community , " he said .
