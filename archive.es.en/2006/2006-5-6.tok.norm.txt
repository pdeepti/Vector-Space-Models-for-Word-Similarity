dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .
the president serves a term of 30 months . anila shuka -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade had failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .

opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .
i think it is very important not to abandon the belarusian people . alexander kudascheff interviewed benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2006 german officials irate about proposed industry ransom fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german government pay to get them back ?
on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .
i think it is very important not to abandon the belarusian people . alexander kudascheff interviewed benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .
the president serves a term of 30 months . anila shuka -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade had failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .
modest beginning for kosovo talks expected for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations sit down together at the negotiating table .
opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .
dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand .
-lrb- april 5 , 2006 -rrb- balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed .

according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .

physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2006 german unemployed urged to get their hands dirty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asparagus picker anna kocsoija : unsurprisingly not german it 's asparagus time !
the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.05.2006 tocotronic ushered in new era of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no plans to break up : guitarist rick mcphail -lrb- first from right -rrb- joined the band just last year since the band was founded in 1993 , tocotronic has influenced a number of german bands with its headstrong music .
dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2006 german unemployed urged to get their hands dirty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asparagus picker anna kocsoija : unsurprisingly not german it 's asparagus time !
the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .

but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon .

" he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2006 german unemployed urged to get their hands dirty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asparagus picker anna kocsoija : unsurprisingly not german it 's asparagus time !
the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category .

this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .

dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts .

tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category .

this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.05.2006 tocotronic ushered in new era of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no plans to break up : guitarist rick mcphail -lrb- first from right -rrb- joined the band just last year since the band was founded in 1993 , tocotronic has influenced a number of german bands with its headstrong music .
dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .
-lrb- april 30 , 2006 -rrb- feedback do you think germans should pick their own asparagus ?

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .
the president serves a term of 30 months . anila shuka -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade had failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .
modest beginning for kosovo talks expected for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations sit down together at the negotiating table .
opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .
dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand .
-lrb- april 5 , 2006 -rrb- balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

" the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .

they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .

several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .

we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .

hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .

hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .

children in paraguay what 's the best way to get back at your country when you think that you 've been treated unfairly ?
" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .
apparently hass is not going to face financial difficulties because of it since he claims that his pension can not be touched to cover alimony payments . he 'll have to hurry , however : german justice minister brigitte zypries has already introduced a bill that would make such " fake paternities " illegal . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new parenting legislation focuses on fathers the falling birth rate is forcing the german government to look for ways to sponsor family-building .
a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .

hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .

on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .
i think it is very important not to abandon the belarusian people . alexander kudascheff interviewed benita ferrero-waldner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .
the president serves a term of 30 months . anila shuka -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade had failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .
modest beginning for kosovo talks expected for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations sit down together at the negotiating table .
opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .
dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand .
-lrb- april 5 , 2006 -rrb- balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .

physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .
the president serves a term of 30 months . anila shuka -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu suspends talks on closer ties with serbia the european commission announced that it had suspended talks on closer ties with serbia because belgrade had failed to fully cooperate with the united nations war crimes court .
modest beginning for kosovo talks expected for the first time since the end of the kosovo war , serbian and ethnic albanian delegations sit down together at the negotiating table .
opinion : eu still playing tug-of-war with balkan states the eu has resumed negotiations on closer ties with serbia , despite belgrade 's flop in delivering the remaining war crimes suspects .
dw 's bernd riegert says it 's becoming increasingly difficult for the union to expand .
-lrb- april 5 , 2006 -rrb- balkan states have high hopes of joining the european club southeastern europeans expect more political stability and economic benefits from joining the eu but are also wary of inflation and their job prospects , an opinion poll has shown .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .

but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .

the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

both the eu and nato are looking ahead at possible membership for southeast europe .
but western europe 's wariness and a lack of regional cooperation are standing in the way . europe may be experiencing growth pains from its biggest expansion to date when it took in 10 new members in may 2004 . but that is n't stopping germany from looking at taking on challenges in southeastern europe when it assumes the presidency of the european union during the first half of 2007 . democratic and economic developments in the countries of the former yugoslavia are not only of interest to the european union , but to nato and foreign investors as well , according to germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler wants stronger regional cooperation in the balkans erler emphasized that " there is no alternative to regional cooperation " in the balkans , which should n't be used as a kind of stalling tactic against integration . " we need the cooperation of the political leaders to counteract these conspiracy theories . " guarded e n thusiasm several pressing issues are putting regional cooperation to the test .
on may 21 , the citizens of montenegro will decide via referendum whether to maintain its union with serbia or claim independence .
serbia also faces the possibility of losing the province of kosovo , a solution favored by the ethnic albanian majority there , when its status is finally decided this year . serbian president boris tadic said wednesday in a statement that he was " worried by every slow down on the road to european integration … because it directly affects our citizens ' wish for a prosperous future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : montenegro proposed holding a referendum to decide the fate of the former yugoslavian republic everyone seems to have their eye on the integration of southeastern europe , though with varying degrees of enthusiasm . " the eu and nato have the same things in mind for the region , " said james pardew from nato headquarters in brussels .
" the first one is integration .
in the balkans , nato and the eu are championing the same values - democracy , rule of law and economic development . " for this reason , said albania 's acting minister of defense petrit karabina , " the albanian government and society are making an effort to combine these elements in a common strategy . " stumbli n g blocks remai n but hurdles remain .
serbia 's recent failure to hand over alleged war criminal radko mladic is a major obstacle on its path to eu accession .
eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn announced wednesday that negotiations with serbia on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- had been suspended because serbia had not arrested the bosnian serb military leader , who has been at large since 1995 . cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , located in the hague , is a prerequisite for drawing closer to the european union .
serbia and montenegro , along with albania and bosnia and herzegovina , is a potential candidate country for the eu .
croatia and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the only two candidates for eu accession among the countries of former yugoslavia , while slovenia became an eu member in 2004 . eu a n d nato pursue differe n t goals the eu and nato may be striving for the same result in southeast europe but to differing ends , according to dusan reljic , southeast europe expert at the foundation for science and politics in berlin . " the eu is a system that spans various areas of life , economics , society and culture , " he said .
" nato is not a political instrument to solve things but a technical military instrument . "
because of this fundamental difference , reljic added he does n't see the need to " directly pair the issues . " croatia , albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia belong to nato 's membership action plan , which makes them candidate countries for nato membership . hans-gert pöttering of germany will tackle integration in southeastern europe and other issues facing the eu , such as the constitutional framework and the financial crisis , when he takes over the presidency of the european parliament from josep borrell fontelles in january 2007 .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .

hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .

we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

on the heels of the release of two german hostages from iraq , a member of parliament has called on industry to foot future ransom costs . days after thomas nitzschke and rene bräunlich stepped on to german soil again , in the wake of 99 days of captivity , many people here believe that only the payment of a sizeable ransom made a happy ending possible in the latest hostage drama involving german nationals in iraq . left-wing social democratic parliamentarian ottmar schreiner told the tabloid bild on friday that german industry should be urged to set up a special fund which would enable it to repay any ransom money the government has to agree to in future abductions of employees of german firms abroad .
he argued that german companies were making good money in other countries , including in crisis regions .
hence it would be only fair if industry refunded any ransom the government paid instead of making taxpayers foot the bill . the bdi federal association of german industry called schreiner 's proposal a big joke , as it would come close to a direct encouragement for kidnappers to try and get their hands on the fund . no blackmail , government says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still speculation that the government paid for susanne osthoff 's release last year from iraq the berlin government also reacted angrily to the leftist mp 's suggestion .
during the recent hostage-taking and after the release of the two engineers it had tried to avoid any impression that ransom was paid to the abductors . " like previous german governments , the current coalition is n't willing to react to blackmail attempts in any way , " said government spokesman thomas steg .
" we 've never engaged in any negotiations about ransom issues , nor are we planning to do so in future .
we 've never paid any ransom to secure the release of german hostages .
against this background , i ca n't really understand why social democrat parliamentarian ottmar schreiner is demanding a so-called ransom fund to be set up by german industry .
why on earth should anyone need such a fund , if ransoms are never paid ? " steg said that schreiner should have thought twice before voicing such a proposal . " i personally believe that this proposal is absurd and pointless , " he said .
" and the best thing you can do about it is to forget it immediately .
i could use different language in evaluating mr schreiner 's suggestion , " he added . glad hostages are back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : candlelight vigils were held weekly for the hostages in leipzig christian democratic party secretary general ronald pofalla also lashed out against any such industry fund , albeit for different reasons .
he did not try to convince the public that no ransom was paid in the latest hostage-taking incident .
but he argued that the debate about full-scale compensation for any release costs was a typically german phenomenon . " shoud n't we instead be glad that the two germans are back safely and unharmed and leave it that ? " he asked . the german firm for which the two former hostages work , called cryotec , has meanwhile signaled it will make up for the costs the foreign ministry incurred for flight tickets and hotel bookings .
but company director peter bienert said there should be no talk of refunding ransom money , as the government insists that none was paid . ex-hostages : we were treated well in their first interview since their release , bräunlich and nitzschke meanwhile on saturday said they had not been mistreated and their captors had been " committed muslims . "
the two also denied suggestions that they had been sold by their hostage takers to another militant group , according to the interview in the leipziger volkszeitu n g daily . " we were held captive by the same group the whole time , " rene bräunlich , 32 , was quoted as saying .
" it 's not true that we were ' sold . " ' thomas nitzschke , 28 , said his captors were " committed muslims " who frequently read the koran and prayed five times a day .
he added they " wanted to fight for their country .

is this the eu 's last word o n this matter u n til hamas recog n izes israel a n d pursues peace ? ferrero-waldner : let me state very clearly what we have done .
on the one hand we have of course paid out humanitarian funds and funds for the basic needs of the palestinian people - and that is a great deal , 100 million euros -lrb- $ 127 million -rrb- at the beginning of this year - which is much more than last year .
this is almost half our total aid for the entire year .
on the other hand we have frozen all the funds which go directly to the palestinian authority or which pass through their hands .
we 'll continue this policy until some final decisions have been made .
hamas as an organization is on the list of terrorist organizations and still has n't recognized important principles .
we hope that a hamas government will move in the right direction .
i 'd just like to quickly name the three principles , as they are all important : renouncing violence , recognizing israel 's right to exist and accepting earlier agreements made by the palestinian authority like the oslo accords and the road map which charts the pathway towards a two-state solution . but that 's a slightly stra n ge sig n al .
o n the o n e ha n d fu n ds are bei n g withheld , but o n the other ha n d you are looki n g for ways to still bri n g fi n a n cial be n efits to the palesti n ia n s .
is n ' t there a da n ger that palesti n ia n s will thi n k : " okay , as hamas we are still hostile towards israel , but we 'll still receive the mo n ey ? " we can not remain indifferent to the needs of the population .
so we are trying to find ways of getting funds to them directly in future .
it is not always easy to explain this to people , but i think that this dual strategy is very important .
of course our primary goal is to see hamas and the government change its stance and recognize our principles , which are also the basic principles of the international community . the eu is mai n ly cou n ti n g o n palesti n ia n preside n t mahmoud abbas .
he is a member of the fatah moveme n t , which lost the electio n s whe n hamas was democratically elected .
is it perhaps a ill-co n ceived strategy to keep backi n g abbas although he represe n ts a moveme n t that the palesti n ia n s are tired of because of its susceptibility to corruptio n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ismail haniyeh of hamas in front of pictures of president mahmoud abbas and late president yasser arafat well , it is a fact that mahmoud abbas was elected as president in presidential elections that were absolutely free and fair .
we need to appreciate this and also recognize the elections that brought hamas to power .
but president abbas is accepted by the international community .
he is a man who wants to drive the peace process forward .
so it is obvious that in these circumstances we 'll try to work with him and through him .
but i think that it is really essential to reinforce his position , because he needs our help in gaining the expertise on how to really conduct the business of a presidential office .
we are basically prepared to offer him our know-how at this point . you say you wa n t to help the people i n specific ways , so what is the eu actually doi n g i n the palesti n ia n territories ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinians need help to rebuild infrastructure we 're doing a lot of work on the ground , but the most important issue is to help the refugees .
they are the poorest of the poor .
here we cooperate closely with the united nations relief organization for palestine refugees , which is working in the area to help these people .
as far as we are able , we are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs , including energy and water .
we are also involved in providing food and education and health care .
adequate medical care is an essential issue in meeting basic needs .
these are the most important things .
of course , we have also sought to press ahead with infrastructure projects and we have also tried to help with a transparent government or institution formation , as we call it .
and if i may be allowed to tackle another issue in connection with funding : people are always asking what the european union is doing .
the best thing would be for israel to start transferring funds again , for this is really palestinian money in the form of duties and tax income .
perhaps it will be possible in future to organize this through an international monitoring mechanism .
then we can say that the funds are being monitored and transactions are transparent and no money is going to the hamas government . hamas ' victory has dealt a major blow to what was already a shaky middle east peace process .
ca n we expect the eu to prese n t a n ew i n itiative i n the n ear future ? we are currently seeking to clarify these financial issues .
we believe that this is important for the general population .
the middle east quartet is due to meet in new york on may 9 and we will certainly continue to discuss our joint strategy there .
i believe that it is very important that mahmoud abbas has an opportunity to get in contact with the new israeli government so that the two sides can move the peace process forward despite the difficulties of the current situation .
we will do all we can in this regard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarusian president alexander lukashenko the middle east is n ot the o n ly area faci n g a crisis , but there is also o n e right o n our doorstep i n europe .
followi n g the re-electio n of the autocrat a n d despot alexa n der lukashe n ko , the situatio n i n belarus is serious a n d the mai n oppositio n leader alexa n der mili n kevich has bee n arrested .
ca n we expect a n y sig n al from the eu ? well , as you saw , i reacted immediately .
we are naturally watching the situation very closely .
milinkevich and some of his supporters in the opposition were detained to prevent any demonstrations taking place on may 1 .
we shall have to see if there is any other action that we can take in future such as freezing credit .
we are keeping our options open and we will see how the european union will react at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers or later .
i would prefer not to say too much at this stage , but we are following the situation very closely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.05.2006 german unemployed urged to get their hands dirty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asparagus picker anna kocsoija : unsurprisingly not german it 's asparagus time !
the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job .
-lrb- april 21 , 2006 -rrb- german farmers like polish workers just fine when germany 's government employment agency recommended out-of-work germans help out with the annual spring harvest , farmers protested loudly .
they prefer the harder-working seasonal workers from eastern europe .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .
several young men in bonn are hoping the program llifts them out of chronic unemployment .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed . " six weeks of hard physical labor appears to be so unattractive to germans that none of them lasts the course .
also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .
if that 's not enough of an incentive , he said , some of the unemployed would be made to learn the hard way - through cuts in their benefits - that the money they spend must first be earned . uwe hessler -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans told to pick their asparagus themselves germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.05.2006 tocotronic ushered in new era of german rock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no plans to break up : guitarist rick mcphail -lrb- first from right -rrb- joined the band just last year since the band was founded in 1993 , tocotronic has influenced a number of german bands with its headstrong music .
dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

also the prospect of facing unemployment again after the harvest discourages some of them . " the return of about 300,000 poles on work permits this season has become a national controversy as many people wonder why some of germany 's approximately 5 million jobless ca n't do the job . using a carrot-and-stick strategy the german labor office has launched a campaign to fill at least 10 percent of seasonal harvest jobs with germans on the dole .
according to edelgard woythe , the head of the local employment office in potsdam - the capital of brandenburg where 50,000 unemployed could theoretically do the job , the government was trying everything to get germans into the fields . unemployed given psychological tests for asparagus suitability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beelitz 's asparagus queen is happy to hold it - but not pick it " we 've put in enormous efforts to convince people to work in the fields , " she said .
" we 've organized group meetings every other day and even held individual conversations with candidates .
physical and psychological tests are being conducted and we 've set up training sessions where people can learn how to pick asparagus . " nevertheless , from brandenburg 's army of jobless only a staggeringly small number of 154 have so far taken on harvesting jobs .
this number is even more stunning considering that jobless germans get an extra bonus of up to 25 euros -lrb- $ 31.50 -rrb- a day and free transportation on a bus that brings them to work and home again . heinrich alt , vice president of the german labor office was convinced that the campaign will gather momentum after its miserable start .
" the harvesting season is just beginning and we are expecting to see an increase in numbers when the strawberry and wine harvests start .
i 'm sure we will be able to reach the 10 percent in the course of the year . " germans can earn between 2,000 and 4,000 euros during the six-week asparagus season , alt claimed .

the slogan screams from every supermarket and roadside stall .
but while germans are enthusiastic consumers , they have no desire to harvest the veg .
a government initiative is trying to change that . the annual asparagus frenzy is under way in germany .
wooden huts at thousands of road junctions , selling only asparagus , have opened their shutters to offer foodies the delicate white stems . but as in previous years the asparagus spring harvest is again stirring a heated controversy over the use of hard-working seasonal workers from eastern europe who some complain are taking away jobs from unemployed germans .
the german government has responded by attempting to bring more germans into the fields to harvest their own crops . in a large asparagus field near the town of beelitz south of berlin , hundreds of workers collect the expensive white stems .
using long metal scoops , they dig them out from banks of earth and then fill the gaps with a trowel . there is , of course , nothing remarkable about asparagus picking in germany - apart from the fact that the workers are often all foreigners .
farmer ernst-august winkelmann said that asparagus was best picked by workers from eastern europe because germans frequently lacked the will and perseverance for the backbreaking job . germans ca n't handle the hard labor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans do n't want the back-breaking job " long-term unemployed germans are no longer used to working for their money , " he claimed .

dw-world.de spoke to singer dirk von lowtzow about changes the band has undergone . even before their first song hit record store shelves , hamburg band tocotronic already had a devoted fan club .
a couple of songs and a handful of shows were all jan müller , arne zank , dirk von lowtzow needed to get a new generation of german rock on its feet . the now ubiquitous but then still unusual attire of tight t-shirts with advertising logos also gave the band a reputation others ended up copying right down to the short in the front , long in the back haircuts . " there were no stores where you could buy the stuff , " von lowtzow said .
" we got out clothes from the donation boxes or flea markets and thought it was completely hilarious to have some kind of band uniform . " sig n i n g about the idiosy n cratic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk von lotzow 's songs concentrated the anger of a generation it was n't just the band 's fashion sense that others imitated .
tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

" father " hundreds of children is the answer one german man came up with . in the 1980s , jürgen hass was a well-respected member of society .
he worked as an insurance salesman in the town of rees near the dutch border and was involved in local politics as a member of the free-market , liberal free democratic party . then , in 1987 , hass was sentenced to three years in prison for fraud .
but he insisted that he was innocent and eventually moved to paraguay .
hass , whose name means " hatred " in german , took with him a built-up anger against the german state .
now he seems to have figured out a way to take " personal , private revenge , " as he put it according to german magazine der spiegel . hass has decided to take advantage of a loophole in germany 's legal system that allows men to recognize children as their own as long as the mother agrees and no other man claims paternity .
the 56-year-old has told the magazine that he 's already recognized about 300 children from paraguay , romania , hungary , moldavia , russia , ukraine and india . he plans to add another 700 by the end of the year , saying that he wants his " children " to benefit from germany 's social welfare system as they become german citizens .

tocotronic 's lyrics - which brought young people 's anger at german middle-class conservativeness to the boiling point by dealing with the peculiar aspects of everyday situations the band 's fans saw reflected in their own lives - were also absorbed by other bands . reading the writing scratched into school desks and spray painted on walls , the german music press prophesied that tocotronic would begin a new era of german pop , along with other bands sucha s blumfeld , kolossale jugend , fünf freunde and huah ! . tocotronic 's 1995 debut album , " digital ist besser " -lrb- digital is better -rrb- , became an anchor for a generation of pop music fans who wanted to stray from the mainstream . to prove their position as outsiders in the german music industry , tocotronic rejected an award from the pop music channel viva in the " young , german and on the way up " category . " back then , there was already a feeling of wanting to nationalize german rock music , " von lowtzow said .
" with the refusal we wanted to make it clear that we are not interested in receiving awards under those conditions . movi n g i n a n ew , orga n ized directio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tocotronic broke out of its self confusion in 2005 after releasing " es is egal , aber " -lrb- it 's does n't matter , but -rrb- , the band decided it needed to develop in a different and new direction .
this new direction took tocotronic to france , where the band worked on a new album with producer carol von rautenkranz and integrated more instruments played by professional orchestra musicians into their songs , leaving the first albums ' scratchy , raw tones on the cutting room floor . it was a process , von lowtzow said , that led to a chaotic period during which the band got lost in the increased effort needed to produce an album .
the situation came to a head in 2002 with tocotronic 's self-titled album , which took a year and a half to produce . to get past their confusion , the band left their headphones in the studio and descended into a berlin basement and recorded their next album in 10 days .
tocotronic 's lyrics changed , from dealing with daily situations to focusing more on the fantastical . " at the beginning these everyday descriptions interested a lot more people , " von lowtzow said .
" back then we had the feeling there were n't many people doing anything like it . some cha n ges always occur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still going strong but tocotronic did n't remain the lone voice of daily life for very long ; pop authors and even advertising companies adopted their style . " suddenly every idiot could write about what it 's like to stand at the cash register and pay for a soda , " von lowtzow said .
" we do n't want to be incorporated into that and at a certain point decided to get interested in things besides this everyday world . " to make the transformation complete , the band traded their logo t-shirts and sweat suits for simple black pants and shirts . at the beginning of 2006 fans were treated to " the best of tocotronic , " but von lowtzow was quick to point out that the lack of new material on the 22-song double album was n't a sign that creative differences were driving the band members apart . " that 's an interpretation that is completely unknown to us , " von lowtzow said .
" at the moment we 're writing some new pieces for a new album , and there are absolutely no thoughts of even partially burying tocotronic .

the poll pits prime minister laisenia qarase 's fijian-dominated sdl party against the predominantly ethnic indian labour party of mahendra chaudhry .
relations between native fijians and ethnic indians , who make up almost 40 % of the population , have been tense .

police were clearly visible around polling stations , which were opened at 0700 local time on saturday -lrb- 1900 gmt on friday -rrb- . "
this is their day and they owe it to fiji that they should do the right thing and vote wisely " pm qarase urges fijians to vote but in some areas , the lack of ballot papers led to queues of thousands of people , some of whom were told to return later , reuters news agency reports .
in the rural west of the main island of viti levu , election officials agreed to keep polling stations open an hour later because some people were kept waiting for up to three hours .
during the poll , 2,000 ballot boxes will be distributed to the 100 of fiji 's 320 islands which are inhabited .
voting is due to last until 13 may , and the ballot-counting is expected to take four days .
twelve parties are trying to win seats in the 71-member parliament .

tensions between the two men are well known and reflect the suspicions that exist between native fijians and ethnic indians .
army chief voreqe bainimarama has said the military will back whichever government is elected .
commodore bainimarama has been engaged in an angry dispute with mr qarase over a controversial amnesty bill that would allow leaders of former coups , such as george speight who led the 2000 coup , to apply to be released .

the poll pits prime minister laisenia qarase 's fijian-dominated sdl party against the predominantly ethnic indian labour party of mahendra chaudhry .
relations between native fijians and ethnic indians , who make up almost 40 % of the population , have been tense .
voting began peacefully , although the start was delayed in some areas with the late arrival of ballot papers .
police were clearly visible around polling stations , which were opened at 0700 local time on saturday -lrb- 1900 gmt on friday -rrb- .
this is their day and they owe it to fiji that they should do the right thing and vote wisely pm qarase urges fijians to vote but in some areas , the lack of ballot papers led to queues of thousands of people , some of whom were told to return later , reuters news agency reports .
in the rural west of the main island of viti levu , election officials agreed to keep polling stations open an hour later because some people were kept waiting for up to three hours .
during the poll , 2,000 ballot boxes will be distributed to the 100 of fiji 's 320 islands which are inhabited .

plans for the self-sufficient community on farmland at glandwr near the preseli mountains were unveiled on saturday .
around 30 houses would be built from natural materials and residents would generate their own electricity and make their livelihoods off the land .
lammas , who are behind the scheme , said it would hold consultation meetings before seeking planning consent .
the group was formed last year with the aim of creating a " model for highly sustainable development " .
spokesperson paul wimbush said it had taken time to identify a suitable site but lammas would unveil its plans and draft design at an open day at the queen 's hall in narberth on saturday .
the project will place pembrokeshire at the cutting edge for sustainable living solutions paul wimbush " it is the perfect location for our project , " he explained .
" we have developed a good working relationship with the owner of the land and held initial meetings with the immediate neighbours , which went very well .
" we will be holding more community consultation meetings in due course .
traditional skills " should things continue to evolve as smoothly as they have to date , we expect to apply for outline planning permission this autumn or winter . "
he said the development on 175 acres would be made-up of about 30 smallholdings .
there are also plans for a community centre , shop , workshop and hostel .
" it will create a wealth of land based produce and will revive many traditional rural skills as well as explore innovative approaches to living on the land , " he added .
" residents of the proposed settlement will need to create their own electricity and will need to demonstrate to the local planning authority that they are substantially meeting their households ' needs from the land .
" all buildings will be made from local , natural materials and will visually blend with the landscape .
" a proportion of the plots will be reserved for local people .
the project will place pembrokeshire at the cutting edge for sustainable living solutions . "
pembrokeshire council and the national park authority have made provision in their development plan , which governs the use of land in the county , for low-impact living .
local councillor lynn davies said " this site is about half a mile from glandwr . "
he said he would wait and see what was proposed and seek feedback from people living nearby before commenting on the plan .

blaine has undergone intensive training for the challenge , shedding 50lbs -lrb- 23kg -rrb- in body weight since january to improve the efficiency with which his body uses oxygen .

after staying on from paul murphy 's era to provide continuity , angela smith goes to join ruth kelly 's new communities and local government department built out of the remains of john prescott 's old empire .
more surprisingly the wealthiest nio minister in memory , millionaire shaun woodward , bids goodbye to security and health in northern ireland to move to tessa jowell 's culture department .
given mr woodward 's background in tv journalism this is something of a return to his roots .
angela smith was well liked by civil servants and lobbyists as she handled her various portfolios which included victims , the environment and economic development .
her most controversial task was to push ahead with the legislation ending academic selection .
the order , which has come in for trenchant criticism from the supporters of grammar schools , is still making its way through parliament .
shaun woodward , a high profile defector from the conservatives , threw himself into his first ministerial job with gusto .
he will no doubt like to be remembered as the politician who approved a total smoking ban in public enclosed spaces for northern ireland and cut hospital waiting lists .
he attracted some less favourable headlines earlier this year when he told the bbc that the ira had ended criminality , a statement which later appeared to be contradicted by both senior police officers and the independent monitoring commission .
the controversy prompted unionist calls for mr woodward 's resignation , calls which the minister strongly rejected , claiming that too much was being made of his comments .
at the time of writing the precise portfolios of the new members of the nio team have yet to be announced .
however , at first sight there appears to be an overlap between the liverpool mp maria eagle 's former responsibilities at the department of education and skills and much of angela smith 's work .
similarly the manchester mp paul goggins ' concentration within the home office on areas like serious and organised crime and the assets recovery agency look to have a natural relevance to shaun woodward 's old brief .
peter hain survives with his two jobs , apparent proof that the allegations made about him concerning a supposed peerage offer have not dented him so far as downing street is concerned .
plaid cymru used parliamentary privilege on thursday to claim that mr hain had offered the recently deceased welsh politician peter law a peerage not to stand against labour in the last election .
but , mr hain vehemently denied the allegation accusing the welsh nationalists of cowardice in not making it to his face .
after emerging from the reshuffle unscathed , mr hain declared that this was an " exciting time for wales " as he pushes through legislation intended to give the welsh assembly greater powers and " a defining period for northern ireland " as he works " flat out " to achieve a restoration of stormont .
clearly it would have been peculiar timing to have moved the secretary of state so close to the 15 may resumption of the assembly .
although , with so many top jobs changing hands it 's a fair bet that mr hain would not have turned down a perch further up the ministerial pecking order .
what of tony blair ?
will this reshuffle diminish the pressure on the prime minister to set a date for his departure .
despite predictable calls from some left-wingers for mr blair to declare a timetable for his departure there 's no sign of him jumping ship any time soon .
most observers agree that the english local election results whilst bad for labour , could have been a lot worse .
discussing mr blair 's future on the bbc 's inside politics two northern ireland born commentators now resident in england , former labour press officer adrian mcmenamin and former labour councillor turned newspaper columnist leo mckinstry , agreed that mr blair looks secure well beyond the 24 november deadline for a stormont deal .
mr mcmenamin thought a left-wing stalking horse challenge might actually strengthen the prime minister 's hand .
if they are right then none of the local parties should be betting on holding onto their trump cards to see how gordon brown or david cameron might deal the pack .

after staying on from paul murphy 's era to provide continuity , angela smith goes to join ruth kelly 's new communities and local government department built out of the remains of john prescott 's old empire .
more surprisingly the wealthiest nio minister in memory , millionaire shaun woodward , bids goodbye to security and health in northern ireland to move to tessa jowell 's culture department .
peter hain will remain as ni secretary given mr woodward 's background in tv journalism this is something of a return to his roots .
angela smith was well liked by civil servants and lobbyists as she handled her various portfolios which included victims , the environment and economic development .
her most controversial task was to push ahead with the legislation ending academic selection .
the order , which has come in for trenchant criticism from the supporters of grammar schools , is still making its way through parliament .
shaun woodward , a high profile defector from the conservatives , threw himself into his first ministerial job with gusto .
he will no doubt like to be remembered as the politician who approved a total smoking ban in public enclosed spaces for northern ireland and cut hospital waiting lists .
he attracted some less favourable headlines earlier this year when he told the bbc that the ira had ended criminality , a statement which later appeared to be contradicted by both senior police officers and the independent monitoring commission .
the controversy prompted unionist calls for mr woodward 's resignation , calls which the minister strongly rejected , claiming that too much was being made of his comments .
at the time of writing the precise portfolios of the new members of the nio team have yet to be announced .
however , at first sight there appears to be an overlap between the liverpool mp maria eagle 's former responsibilities at the department of education and skills and much of angela smith 's work .
similarly the manchester mp paul goggins ' concentration within the home office on areas like serious and organised crime and the assets recovery agency look to have a natural relevance to shaun woodward 's old brief .
shaun woodward bids goodbye to the health and security portfolios peter hain survives with his two jobs , apparent proof that the allegations made about him concerning a supposed peerage offer have not dented him so far as downing street is concerned .
plaid cymru used parliamentary privilege on thursday to claim that mr hain had offered the recently deceased welsh politician peter law a peerage not to stand against labour in the last election .
but , mr hain vehemently denied the allegation accusing the welsh nationalists of cowardice in not making it to his face .
after emerging from the reshuffle unscathed , mr hain declared that this was an " exciting time for wales " as he pushes through legislation intended to give the welsh assembly greater powers and " a defining period for northern ireland " as he works " flat out " to achieve a restoration of stormont .
clearly it would have been peculiar timing to have moved the secretary of state so close to the 15 may resumption of the assembly .
although , with so many top jobs changing hands it 's a fair bet that mr hain would not have turned down a perch further up the ministerial pecking order .
what of tony blair ?
will this reshuffle diminish the pressure on the prime minister to set a date for his departure .
despite predictable calls from some left-wingers for mr blair to declare a timetable for his departure there 's no sign of him jumping ship any time soon .
most observers agree that the english local election results whilst bad for labour , could have been a lot worse .
discussing mr blair 's future on the bbc 's inside politics two northern ireland born commentators now resident in england , former labour press officer adrian mcmenamin and former labour councillor turned newspaper columnist leo mckinstry , agreed that mr blair looks secure well beyond the 24 november deadline for a stormont deal .
mr mcmenamin thought a left-wing stalking horse challenge might actually strengthen the prime minister 's hand .

geraldine smith made the attack as mr prescott hung on as deputy prime minister but was stripped of his department in a cabinet reshuffle .
fellow labour backbencher kate hoey said people would wonder " what on earth he is going to get paid for " .
but no 10 says mr prescott has a heavy workload chairing cabinet committees .
' no demotion ' mr prescott has faced damaging newspaper headlines during the past fortnight after admitting having an affair with one of his secretaries , tracey temple .
downing street insisted he was not being demoted in the reshuffle .
the bulk of mr prescott 's local government and communities brief passes to ex-education secretary ruth kelly .
the deputy prime minister will keep his grace-and-favour apartment at admiralty house in london and his official country residence of dorneywood in buckinghamshire .
and he is likely to continue to take charge of running the government when mr blair is out of the country .
' astonishment ' morecambe bay mp ms smith told bbc radio 4 's today programme mr blair had sent the wrong signal by suggesting mr prescott was not fit to run his department but good enough to remain deputy prime minister .
" it is outrageous that the deputy prime minister loses his department but keeps his position , his salary and the perks of the job , " she said .
" most people were astonished by this reshuffle .
he will be laughed at - that is the most devastating thing that can happen michael heseltine ex-deputy prime minister " we have had excellent ministers like jack straw , and he is just side-lined , while people like john prescott remain in their post without the responsibilities of office . "
the conservatives accused mr prescott of being a waste of public money .
shadow chancellor george osborne said : " john prescott loses his department but keeps the trappings of office - including the car , the salary , and the two grace-and-favour homes .
" add it all up , and the taxpayer is going to be paying more than a quarter of a million pounds a year .
if you 're looking for ways to cut waste in government , you can start with john prescott . "
' experienced ' shadow home secretary david davis dubbed the deputy prime minister " prescott-lite " .
mr blair would have found it difficult to sack mr prescott without triggering an election to replace him as labour 's deputy leader .
but new labour chairwoman hazel blears said mr prescott had been planning for some time to give up his departmental responsibilities to concentrate on other issues .
" the job that john prescott will be doing , and actually has been doing for a long time now , will be chairing some pretty high-level committees designed to try to make sure that policy right across government is focused on the things that matter to the public , " she said .
" he 's got a lot of experience of doing that .
he 's also going to be following up some of the kyoto issues around climate change . "
former conservative deputy prime minister michael heseltine said mr blair had obviously wanted to make major cabinet changes but been unable to sack anybody apart from home secretary charles clarke .
lord heseltine said john major had never told him he had " screwed things up " but could keep his title and money .
he said mr prescott was now a " figure of fun " .
" that is humiliating , that is the most devastating and damaging thing that can happen , " he said .
