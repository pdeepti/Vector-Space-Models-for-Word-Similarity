ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use .

the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .

' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

" there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency .

france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .

" belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mittal steel executives aditya -lrb- l -rrb- and lakshmi -lrb- r -rrb- mittal eventually got what they wanted - arcelor germany-based e.on has made europe 's largest takeover bid – a $ 66 billion offer for spanish competitor endesa .
e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .
the eu commission recently ordered madrid to remove regulatory hurdles by jan .

deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .
as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .
this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .
instead , foreign minister tuomioja was forced to kick his diplomatic skills into high gear in handling the crisis in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cold is really cold in finland relations with russia ultimately deteriorated during the finns ' time at the eu helm .
the unsolved murder case of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , russia 's conflict with georgia and poland 's argument with russia over energy and trade due to a spat over meat imports all served to make finland 's path decidedly rockier . nonetheless , following a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , prime minister vanhanen said that the eu and russia belonged together . " russia needs our markets , " vanhanen said .
" it needs us as much as we need it in many areas .
we are deeply entwined with each other , and both sides use that to their advantage . " success at the finish line despite the difficulties along the way , the finns did rack up one major success at the end of its presidency .
tuomioja managed to prompt eu foreign ministers to reach an agreement on a common eu position concerning turkey 's accession to the bloc .
member-states said they would freeze negotiations on eight out of 35 policy areas , primarily due to turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to eu-member cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " santa 's " house during polar night in finland two major laws were also passed during finland 's six months .
after years of intense debate , the european parliament passed rules deregulating the eu 's service sector . under the finnish watch , eu lawmakers likewise passed a controversial bill to curb the use of hazardous chemicals .
the so-called reach legislation requires eu businesses to prove that the chemicals they use or manufacture do not present a danger to human health or the environment . the finnish eu leadership also succeeded in getting other initiatives up and running , especially in the areas of research and in certain mobile phone charges . brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency dw-world.de 's special on germany 's eu presidency eu ministers agree to slow turkey 's membership talks european union foreign ministers have agreed on a partial suspension on membership talks with turkey in response to ankara 's failure to respect its trade obligations to eu member cyprus .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .

even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .

the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 27.12.2006 boeing overtakes airbus in new orders for 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing 's 787 dreamliner was a hit , while airbus hit a wall with a350 delivery problems us airplane maker boeing has overtaken europe 's floundering airbus consortium , ending five years of runner-up status . the year 2006 saw boeing take in some 25 percent more orders than its european rival airbus , according to a report in the financial times deutschland newspaper .
according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .

e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .

deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .

real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .

the unsolved murder case of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , russia 's conflict with georgia and poland 's argument with russia over energy and trade due to a spat over meat imports all served to make finland 's path decidedly rockier . nonetheless , following a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , prime minister vanhanen said that the eu and russia belonged together .

" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mittal steel executives aditya -lrb- l -rrb- and lakshmi -lrb- r -rrb- mittal eventually got what they wanted - arcelor germany-based e.on has made europe 's largest takeover bid – a $ 66 billion offer for spanish competitor endesa .
e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .
the eu commission recently ordered madrid to remove regulatory hurdles by jan .

deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .
as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .
this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 27.12.2006 " we 're looking for a second earth " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corot will be the first satellite to search for planets outside our solar system european satellite project corot will be launched wednesday to seek out earth-like planets beyond the solar system .
dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .

e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .

european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use .

even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .

" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore .

the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .

just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .

the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .
instead , foreign minister tuomioja was forced to kick his diplomatic skills into high gear in handling the crisis in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cold is really cold in finland relations with russia ultimately deteriorated during the finns ' time at the eu helm .
the unsolved murder case of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , russia 's conflict with georgia and poland 's argument with russia over energy and trade due to a spat over meat imports all served to make finland 's path decidedly rockier . nonetheless , following a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , prime minister vanhanen said that the eu and russia belonged together . " russia needs our markets , " vanhanen said .
" it needs us as much as we need it in many areas .
we are deeply entwined with each other , and both sides use that to their advantage . " success at the finish line despite the difficulties along the way , the finns did rack up one major success at the end of its presidency .
tuomioja managed to prompt eu foreign ministers to reach an agreement on a common eu position concerning turkey 's accession to the bloc .
member-states said they would freeze negotiations on eight out of 35 policy areas , primarily due to turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to eu-member cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " santa 's " house during polar night in finland two major laws were also passed during finland 's six months .
after years of intense debate , the european parliament passed rules deregulating the eu 's service sector . under the finnish watch , eu lawmakers likewise passed a controversial bill to curb the use of hazardous chemicals .
the so-called reach legislation requires eu businesses to prove that the chemicals they use or manufacture do not present a danger to human health or the environment . the finnish eu leadership also succeeded in getting other initiatives up and running , especially in the areas of research and in certain mobile phone charges . brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency dw-world.de 's special on germany 's eu presidency eu ministers agree to slow turkey 's membership talks european union foreign ministers have agreed on a partial suspension on membership talks with turkey in response to ankara 's failure to respect its trade obligations to eu member cyprus .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .

oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .

e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .

european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mittal steel executives aditya -lrb- l -rrb- and lakshmi -lrb- r -rrb- mittal eventually got what they wanted - arcelor germany-based e.on has made europe 's largest takeover bid – a $ 66 billion offer for spanish competitor endesa .
e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .
the eu commission recently ordered madrid to remove regulatory hurdles by jan .
19 or face legal action - a call for europe's governments to enable free competition on the european energy market .
deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .
as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .
this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers -pipe- 27.12.2006 mergers and acquisitions saw banner year in europe in 2006 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has stepped in to push along e.on 's bid for endesa the year 2006 was a record one for mergers and acquisitions .
german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mittal steel executives aditya -lrb- l -rrb- and lakshmi -lrb- r -rrb- mittal eventually got what they wanted - arcelor germany-based e.on has made europe 's largest takeover bid – a $ 66 billion offer for spanish competitor endesa .
e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .
the eu commission recently ordered madrid to remove regulatory hurdles by jan .
19 or face legal action - a call for europe's governments to enable free competition on the european energy market .
deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .
as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .
this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .
tour guide thomas merz will then keep his job because the 300,000 square meter terminal will be rented out and there will still be visitors eager for a walk around this piece of berlin history . there 's still no final word on the future of the legendary airport . about the only thing certain is that flights will continue to land there until at least 2008 . uwe hessler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-era airport will close a year later than planned a german court has said berlin 's ' nazi ' airport , tempelhof , which was supposed to close on oct 31 , 2007 , could stay open for another year in a compromise deal .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .
instead , foreign minister tuomioja was forced to kick his diplomatic skills into high gear in handling the crisis in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cold is really cold in finland relations with russia ultimately deteriorated during the finns ' time at the eu helm .
the unsolved murder case of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , russia 's conflict with georgia and poland 's argument with russia over energy and trade due to a spat over meat imports all served to make finland 's path decidedly rockier . nonetheless , following a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , prime minister vanhanen said that the eu and russia belonged together . " russia needs our markets , " vanhanen said .
" it needs us as much as we need it in many areas .
we are deeply entwined with each other , and both sides use that to their advantage . " success at the finish line despite the difficulties along the way , the finns did rack up one major success at the end of its presidency .
tuomioja managed to prompt eu foreign ministers to reach an agreement on a common eu position concerning turkey 's accession to the bloc .
member-states said they would freeze negotiations on eight out of 35 policy areas , primarily due to turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to eu-member cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " santa 's " house during polar night in finland two major laws were also passed during finland 's six months .
after years of intense debate , the european parliament passed rules deregulating the eu 's service sector . under the finnish watch , eu lawmakers likewise passed a controversial bill to curb the use of hazardous chemicals .
the so-called reach legislation requires eu businesses to prove that the chemicals they use or manufacture do not present a danger to human health or the environment . the finnish eu leadership also succeeded in getting other initiatives up and running , especially in the areas of research and in certain mobile phone charges . brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency dw-world.de 's special on germany 's eu presidency eu ministers agree to slow turkey 's membership talks european union foreign ministers have agreed on a partial suspension on membership talks with turkey in response to ankara 's failure to respect its trade obligations to eu member cyprus .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .

loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .

levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .

the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .

for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .

" it needs us as much as we need it in many areas .
we are deeply entwined with each other , and both sides use that to their advantage . " success at the finish line despite the difficulties along the way , the finns did rack up one major success at the end of its presidency .
tuomioja managed to prompt eu foreign ministers to reach an agreement on a common eu position concerning turkey 's accession to the bloc .
member-states said they would freeze negotiations on eight out of 35 policy areas , primarily due to turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to eu-member cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " santa 's " house during polar night in finland two major laws were also passed during finland 's six months .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

according to an annual report issued by boeing , the chicago based company had 904 orders in the year up to dec .
20 versus 714 for airbus , a figure including 635 new orders at the end of november plus new orders published in december . boeing 's new , more fuel-efficient 787 " dreamliner " jet and 777 aircraft proved to be the prize attractions .
' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .

but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .

airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 27.12.2006 " we 're looking for a second earth " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corot will be the first satellite to search for planets outside our solar system european satellite project corot will be launched wednesday to seek out earth-like planets beyond the solar system .
dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .

e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .

european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .

even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?

" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .
the green space will help improve the climate in berlin , they say .

saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ?

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .

e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .

european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .

in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .

" we are inter-dependent , " belarus 's deputy prime minister vladimir semashko said at minsk airport late tuesday after returning home from fruitless gas negotiations in moscow .
" if i do n't have a domestic gas supply contract , gazprom wo n't have a transit deal . " gazprom acknowledged that its latest round of negotiations with belarus on a steep price increase failed , but said europe was safe due to gas reserves in germany and austria to guard against possible cuts . " unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .

australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions bavarian farmer harvests energy can carbon capture stop climate change ? environment -pipe- 27.12.2006 kenya signs historical emissions agreement for power plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severe drought is just one of the effects of climate change as kenyans battle the environmental effects of climate change , the country 's electricity company has signed an historic emission reduction agreement with the world bank to expand a geo-thermal power plant . looking down from one of the majestic mountain ranges that lie a few hours drive from kenya ’ s capital city of nairobi , lush valleys spread out for kilometers , and lake naivasha glimmers in the distance , teeming with wildlife .
but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .

two years ago , oliver hirschbiegel 's " the downfall " offered a vision of the gloom of hitler 's last 10 days alive .
it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version . " go for zucker " the low-budget project is funded by german public tv corporations wdr , arte , br and others after levy 's success in 2004 with the movie , " go for zucker . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy and actress maria schrader at a showing of " meschugge " - a joint film project that comedy , about two squabbling jewish brothers misbehaving in 1990s germany , outraged many conservative jews . in the new movie , it may be a slight salve that the jewish character , gruenbaum , is not meant to be laughed at . mühe , who plays gruenbaum , earlier had the lead roles as both a jew and joseph goebbels in an inept german movie comedy about the nazis , " goebbels and geduldig , " and won a european best-actor award this year for a film about communist dictatorship . however , levy 's production team admit they found it creepy to film " mein führer " on berlin streets in the first two months of 2006 with crowds of extras massed on the street in nazi uniforms , shouting " heil hitler " and waving swastika banners . what levy 's mother makes of the movie is also unknown . " after the first draft of the script , i spoke to my mother who herself experienced nazism as a jew in berlin , " levy said .
" i wanted to know if she had a major moral issue , but she just said , ' do n't come complaining to me if the critics maul you .

it certainly was not light-hearted entertainment . while germans enjoy sophisticated lampooning of their living politicians on tv and at cabaret clubs , they have never learned to giggle about hitler , their homegrown monster : he was just too awful . awful , levy might say , is not always healthy .
loathing puts hitler on a kind of " pedestal of monstrosity " which levy says has to be knocked down .
the director asserts he has a right to apply " ' subversive jewish humor " to cut the nazi leader down to size . the comic hitler of the movie is portrayed as too depressed to give one of his ranting speeches .
so he arranges for a -lrb- fictional -rrb- jewish acting teacher , adolf gruenbaum , played by german actor ulrich mühe , to give him a five-day crash course in effective speaking . hitler is played by helge schneider , a german musician and occasional actor who usually presents traveling comedy shows .
schneider , 51 , does not look like anything hitler , but add lank , dyed hair , a toothbrush moustache and rubber mask , and anyone can . make-up specialist gregor eckstein said the hardest part was persuading schneider to give up his long blonde hair for the part . hitler as a bed-wetter during gruenbaum 's therapy , this hitler wears a yellow tracksuit and reveals he is insecure , impotent and a bed-wetter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanging up swastikas for filming was controversial in berlin this version can be traced back to wartime allied jokes aimed at belittling hitler .
levy said he was influenced by the theory of swiss-based psychologist alice miller , published in 1980 , that something must have gone wrong with hitler in his childhood . his other inspiration was a book by paul devrient , a german who really did coach hitler in public speaking . although the movie does not open in germany until january 11 , and reviewers have yet to say how successful levy has been in his self-imposed cultural mission , the media have already been debating whether such a film is a healthy development . while levy says that his title , " the truly truest truth , " mocks the stern intonation of the usual german tv documentaries about the nazi leader , some commentators wonder what tomorrow 's children will understand about hitler , if they only remember the comedy version .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .
that , at least , is the way finland presented itself when it took up the european union presidency this past summer . finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and his team were perhaps a bit idiosyncratic , but definitely pragmatic in how they went about eu business for the six-month term . listening to all those double-vowel combinations in finnish , however , was a bit difficult to get used to .
the eu president 's team ended up installing an online guide so broadcast journalists could get the pronunciation of vanhanen 's name right , as well as that of foreign minister erkki tuomioja and tarja halonen , the country 's head of state . lebanon crisis rather than russia agenda creating new partnerships with resource-rich russia was supposed to top the to-do list of finland 's eu presidency , particularly since they share a border .
instead , foreign minister tuomioja was forced to kick his diplomatic skills into high gear in handling the crisis in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cold is really cold in finland relations with russia ultimately deteriorated during the finns ' time at the eu helm .
the unsolved murder case of russian journalist anna politkovskaya , russia 's conflict with georgia and poland 's argument with russia over energy and trade due to a spat over meat imports all served to make finland 's path decidedly rockier . nonetheless , following a meeting with russian president vladimir putin , prime minister vanhanen said that the eu and russia belonged together . " russia needs our markets , " vanhanen said .
" it needs us as much as we need it in many areas .
we are deeply entwined with each other , and both sides use that to their advantage . " success at the finish line despite the difficulties along the way , the finns did rack up one major success at the end of its presidency .
tuomioja managed to prompt eu foreign ministers to reach an agreement on a common eu position concerning turkey 's accession to the bloc .
member-states said they would freeze negotiations on eight out of 35 policy areas , primarily due to turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to eu-member cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " santa 's " house during polar night in finland two major laws were also passed during finland 's six months .
after years of intense debate , the european parliament passed rules deregulating the eu 's service sector . under the finnish watch , eu lawmakers likewise passed a controversial bill to curb the use of hazardous chemicals .
the so-called reach legislation requires eu businesses to prove that the chemicals they use or manufacture do not present a danger to human health or the environment . the finnish eu leadership also succeeded in getting other initiatives up and running , especially in the areas of research and in certain mobile phone charges . brussels correspondent bernd riegert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency dw-world.de 's special on germany 's eu presidency eu ministers agree to slow turkey 's membership talks european union foreign ministers have agreed on a partial suspension on membership talks with turkey in response to ankara 's failure to respect its trade obligations to eu member cyprus .

but there was little sympathy for the former dictator . european governments expressed their opposition to the death penalty , but respected iraq 's sovereignty in dealing with saddam . according to iraqi law , saddam should be hanged within 30 days .
iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki 's government has said it will not shy away from carrying out the sentence .
saddam was convicted in november of crimes against humanity for allegedly ordering the deaths of 148 shiite men from the village of dujail . the german government said wednesday it was satisfied that that the trial had been both necessary and fair .
while stressing that germany is " categorically opposed to the death penalty , " saddam deserved to be tried for crimes against humanity , said the government 's deputy spokesman thomas steg . " there is nothing to indicate the trial , including the appeals process , did not take place in accordance with the rule of law and legal principles in operation in iraq , " steg said . the trial helped iraq " legally come to terms " with its past , the government said . britain agreed , saying that saddam 's execution should be left up to the independent iraqi tribunal , a foreign office spokesman in london told the afp news agency . " our position is unchanged .
we are opposed to the death penalty as a matter of principle , but the decision is one for the iraqi authorities , " the spokesman said . reconciliation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam reacts against his verdict france reacted similarly , voicing its opposition to capital punishment , but saying that only iraq could decide how to punish saddam . the french foreign ministry said that the decision to execute saddam should be left up to the iraqi people and the sovereign authorities in iraq .
france 's priority remains to work for the reconciliation of the iraqi people to restore " complete sovereignty , " the statement said . italy expressed concern about the death sentence .
italian foreign minister massimo d 'alema said he feared the execution of saddam would have negative consequences for reconciliation in iraq . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " will saddam hussein 's execution change anything ? "
dw readers voiced their opinions on the court ruling that saddam hussein is to be executed by hanging , with most respondents voicing their disapproval of the death penalty .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- europeans divided on saddam death sentence while political leaders across europe said saddam hussein should be held accountable for his actions , they also expressed their opposition to the death penalty the former iraqi dictator received .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .

but the reality behind this apparent garden of eden is very different .
it ’ s partly the fault of kenya ’ s ever growing population , the ensuing man-made pollution , and the speed at which its forests are being felled for fire wood .
but it ’ s also because the effects of climate change are making themselves felt here .
nelly damaris chepkoskei , a farmer from kericho district outside of nairobi , is 50 years .
she has clear smooth skin , her crinkly jet black hair is streaked with gray wisps , and a ruby and gold cloth is wrapped elegantly around her head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the earth warms , disease-carrying mosquitoes are becoming more wide-spread she told dw-radio that her country ’ s new climate reality has brought longer droughts , unexpected frosts , and mosquitoes .
" i had not seen mosquitoes before and now there are so many " she said .
" and when they bite the children and the women , the mothers have go to hospital to nurse the sick children plus work at home . "
the sad contradiction of this situation , is that the people who are now being directly affected by and are suffering because of climate change , are not responsible for making it happen .
africa hit hard by climate change responsibility lies firmly in the hands of the world ’ s rich industrialized countries , that have been pumping green house gases into the atmosphere for decades .
hans verolme is the director of wwf ’ s global climate change program .
he believes the developed world should open their eyes to the hardships that many africans , like nelly , are having to deal with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the countries that are responsible for global warming are not necessarily those who are affected the most verolme said these countries should commit to tackling global warming seriously because they are " responsible in a major way for the emissions that are currently in the atmosphere . "
" we can not expect kenya to do the same , " he said .
" kenya is an example of a country that needs our help but is otherwise not responsible . "
one way that industrialized countries can help reduce green house gas emissions , is through the clean development mechanism or cdm .
under the cdm , which is part of the kyoto protocol , developed countries can finance environmentally-friendly energy , infrastructure , agriculture and forestry projects in the developing world .
electricity in short supply unfortunately , accessing energy and electricity in kenya is very difficult .
according to eddy njoroge , the managing director of kenya ’ s main electricity provider kenton , only fifteen percent of the population have access to electricity .
in the rural areas this drops down to four percent , he says .
the enormous rift valley stretches all the way from the dead sea in israel , right down to east africa .
just a few hours outside of nairobi is where you ’ ll find hell ’ s gate national park .
and right in the center of this park is where the answer to eddy njoroge ’ s problem may lie - because this is the perfect environment for drawing geo-thermal energy from deep out of the ground .
green energy from rocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's masai women call for more to be done to tackle climate change environmentally-friendly , geo-thermal energy is sourced by pumping hot water 2000 meters from under the ground all the way up to the surface .
these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .
small-scale geo-thermal energy and it ’ s also encouraging other businesses to make use of green geo-thermal energy - like the oserian flower farm , just down the road .
osserian is a cut flower grower exporting around 400 million stems a year to europe .
it has to make sure that the thousands of flowers growing in its massive greenhouses have a constantly mild temperature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya 's flower growers need to heat their greenhouses at night so the farm ’ s owners decided to make use of the geo-thermal wells drilled during the initial exploration of the olkaria geothermal field .
the wells oserian uses aren ’ t suitable for the mass power production kengen needs , but are perfect for supplying the warmth and carbon dioxide needed for growing roses .
oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .
oserian is currently the only local business putting geo-thermal energy to use in this way , knight said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the variable climate caused by global warming is making is making life difficult for farmers no matter how small a scale , tying private enterprise to increasing green energy use may be the answer to reducing the world ’ s carbon dioxide emissions .
a report by the world bank 's former chief economist , sir nicholas stern , called climate change " the greatest and widest ranging market failure ever seen . "
he said failure to deal with it now , could shrink the world ’ s economy by 20 percent .
although progress is slow , steps are being taken to reduce global co2 emissions .
but one problem still remains - even if emissions were reduced to zero today , nothing can stop the next few decades worth of climate change from happening . anja kueppers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

these it drives turbines and produces " green " electricity .
with financial support from the west , two geo-thermal power stations have already been built in this area in the last 30 years .
one of these is called olkaria .
it ’ s hard to miss the kilometers of piping transporting the geo-thermal energy from the olkaria power plant , that run right through the heart of this national park .
and the amount of hot steam they ’ re transporting is set to increase further , because just a few weeks ago , kengen signed an historic emission reductions purchase agreement with the world bank .
this means the world bank will buy emission reductions at olkaria , giving kengen the funds to expand the plant and to generate an additional 35 mw over the next two years .
this is the first cdm geo-thermal energy project in africa .
it will save the equivalent of 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year from entering the atmosphere .

oserian ’ s mini geo-thermal power plant produces 1.8 mw of power .
this is used to heat and control the humidity in the greenhouses , which in turn protects the flowers from fungal diseases and so reduces the amount of fungicides used .
cheaper power it also saves the company considerable money .
oserian has had to invest about 25 million euros into its geo-thermal processes .
according to bruce knight , oserian ’ s chief engineer , there was initially a " lot of cynicism " about the project but it has proved worthwhile .

what did it achieve in six-months ' time ?
for one thing , lebanon replaced russia on the agenda . finland is home to over 50,000 lakes , endless forests , elk , reindeer and a people who are fond of vodka and heavy metal music .

" unfortunately , negotiations in fact ended without a result , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov said on russian state television , vesti 24 . gazprom has threatened to reduce deliveries to belarus on january 1 if the ex-soviet republic refuses to pay higher prices from 2007 and share control of its pipelines with the russian firm . however , kupriyanov assured that western european clients would not be affected by the row , which is similar to a crisis between gazprom and ukraine at the start of 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom cut supplies to hungary in jan .
2006 due to a dispute with ukraine then , gazprom temporarily cut off supplies to ukraine , which produced gas shortages in europe in the dead of winter . gazprom , the world 's largest gas producer , supplies a quarter of europe 's gas needs .
the cut-off to ukraine prompted european leaders to raise concerns over reliance on russia . about 80 percent of the russian gas piped to europe transits through ukraine and about 20 percent through belarus . gas in european storage a russian gas industry source told reuters news agency that gazprom had stored much more gas than in germany and austria as compared to last year and could cover contracts in europe for several weeks if needed . the industry source said extra gas had been pumped into rheden , the biggest storage facility in germany , belonging to wingas , a joint venture of gazprom and germany 's petrochemical giant basf .
extra gas has also apparently been stored in its haidach storage facility in austria . kupriyanov has confirmed extra european gas reserves : " there are no grounds for concern among european consumers , " he told state television vesti 24 . agreement still possible a belarussian energy ministry official who wished to remain anonymous told russian news agency interfax that he still hoped for an accord with gazprom .
" we continue to formulate our position , and we hope for a softening of gazprom 's position , " the official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder -lrb- r -rrb- and russian president vladimir signed a deal in 2005 to create a russian-german pipeline under the baltic sea by 2010 he described threats by gazprom that belarus could face a cut-off as " rather brusque . " belarus currently pays gazprom $ 46.68 per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,315 cubic feet -rrb- of gas . gazprom has said it wants to charge around $ 200 , unless belarus agrees to sell 50 percent of its pipeline operator beltransgaz , giving the russian state-owned giant an important strategic foothold on the european union 's eastern border . earlier on tuesday , gazprom said it was prepared to scale back and charge only $ 110 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters . kupriyanov said that by comparison , ukraine would pay $ 130 for gas in 2007 .

german energy giant e.on 's $ 66 billion -lrb- 50 billion euro -rrb- takeover bid for spain 's endesa was the largest european deal . around the world in 2006 , some 29,000 mergers and acquisitions took place with an approximate total of $ 3.6 trillion changing hands – 10 percent more than in the last record-setting year , 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mittal steel executives aditya -lrb- l -rrb- and lakshmi -lrb- r -rrb- mittal eventually got what they wanted - arcelor germany-based e.on has made europe 's largest takeover bid – a $ 66 billion offer for spanish competitor endesa .
e.on raised its bid by 40 percent in late september , thereby sending endesa shareholders " the clear and unmistakeable message " that the company stands behind its offer , as board chairman wulf bernotat said in a teleconference at the time .
but the transaction remains unfinished , and national concerns on the part of spain could eventually deal it a fatal blow .
despite being repeatedly called on the carpet by the eu commission , spain does not want its energy production placed in foreign hands .
the eu commission recently ordered madrid to remove regulatory hurdles by jan .
19 or face legal action - a call for europe's governments to enable free competition on the european energy market .
deutsche börse-euronext deal fails the same types of national issues have plagued a long-awaited consolidation of european stock exhanges .
deutsche börse 's repeated offers to cooperate with paris-based euronext fell on deaf ears , and in the end , the deal was eventually dropped .
the biggest global deal was us-based , with american telecoms giant at & t buying competitor bellsouth for $ 83 billion .
but the third-largest merger overall had a european imprint : the $ 43 billion union of french power concern suez and gaz de france .
drug-firm action : just the beginning ?
european concerns were also at the heart of the fourth-largest merger , which saw india 's mittal group eventually get its hands on luxemburg-based steel giant arcelor , after a russian steel company was used to boost the price .
the bidding drew much media coverage , much of it centered on lakshmi mittal , the controversial head of the world 's largest steel concern .
mittal said in mid-september that the merger had been a success , and that the newly merged company was running smoothly .
in germany , the fight for berlin-based pharmaceuticals concern schering was one of the most watched takeover battles of the year .
the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayer finished what merck started : a schering takeover further consolidation in the health care and pharmaceuticals industry is expected , experts say .
as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .
in reality , the market value of half of the companies that were involved in mergers or acquisitions had failed to keep up with the industry index , while 30 to 40 percent had improved on it .
this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

the story started with family-run drugs firm merck making a move to take over dax-listed schering .
schering put up a fight , only to be eventually bought by bayer for 17 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- .
schering shareholders saw their stock rise 40 percent on the deal .

as bayer management board chairman werner wenning recently told reporters : " it is still a relatively fragmented industry . "
real results whether mergers and acquisitions actually meet investor expectations is a question without an easy answer .
the future often looks bright immediately after a merger or takeover , according to joachim spill , a partner at consulting firm ernst & young .
but this can often be chalked up to post-deal euphoria .
the real results can only be seen somewhere between one and three years after companies have merged , spill said .

this explains why mergers are occasionally undone : years ago , bmw shed rover , to the great relief of many shareholders .

the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .

ideas include locating berlin 's universities on the site , building an amusement park or creating a " green lung " for the city . there are few places in the world that have an airport so close to the city center as berlin does . but it 's not just tempelhof airport 's prime location that has placed it at the heart of an intense debate in the german capital . the cavernous , loss-making airport , best known as the site of the famous berlin airlift that guaranteed the city 's survival in the face of a soviet blockade in 1948 and 1949 , is to be closed by 2008 according to a recent court ruling .
the prospect of all that vast space lying idle in the heart of berlin has fueled new interest in the site and a number of investors and experts have lined up with ideas for the airport 's future use . " in the time that this has been going on with the airport , i 've heard so many different plans , it just makes me sick , " said thomas merz , who used to work in the airport 's control tower before retiring .
he now gives airport tours to visitors . " they suggested a disney theme park which is crazy because the one in paris is already struggling .
then they spoke of a recreational park which was followed by plans for a residential area , " said merz .
" i 've known this airport for over ten years , and now through the guided tours i 've learned about the history of this airport - the oldest in the world , how can you close such a historic airport ? " airport 's central role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof 's central location makes it a target for development the site has been used for aviation for more than a hundred years and it was the location of the world 's first commercial airport when templehof officially opened its doors and runways in 1923 .
three years later , german national carrier lufthansa began flying from there . in the 1930s , tempelhof was europe 's main air hub .
nazi leader adolf hitler used the airport for propaganda purposes .
for his planned capital germania , he commissioned the construction of the biggest building in europe .
the result was the tempelhof terminal . the berlin airlift made the airport famous around the world .
when the soviet blockade of berlin started in 1948 , allied pilots flying supplies to west berliners landed at templehof . running on nostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof played an central role in the berlin airlift today , the airport loses millions of euros annually .
even so , berliners such as former mayor eberhard diepgen have fought to keep it open .
history is n't the only thing that makes the airport worth keeping , diepgen says . " berlin must do everything to attract international business . " he said .
" everything that is good for potential investors and which makes life easy must be provided , especially an airport in the middle of the city , which you ca n't find in many cities anymore . " others have come to terms with its closure and have come up with some unconventional - some would say wacky - ideas to reinvent the place . berlin economics professor michael burda has suggested merging the city 's free university and humboldt university and making tempelhof its home .
the idea , according to burda , would not just make for one of the most intriguing campuses in the world , but would also help the cash-strapped german capital save money . the latest vision for tempelhof is to convert it into a giant luxury health center , complete with its own airfield .
the plan has captured the imagination of international investors such as american businessman fred langhammer , the former chairman of cosmetics firm estée lauder .
even germany 's national rail , deutsche bahn , has shown interest in the proposal . but the berlin government has rejected the spa concept , fearing that keeping tempelhof open could jeopardize plans to expand another airport on the outskirts of berlin .
the city has made plans of its own , said government spokeswoman manuela damianakis . natural takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the closed airport revert to nature ?
" the solution we envision is to let nature reclaim this site and to have a huge free space here which the people of berlin can use for their own purposes , " she said .
" on its fringes , we will allow some urban development , but only if it makes sense . " the city wants the airport to remain undeveloped open land .

' annus horribilis ' as opposed to boeing 's shining track record , airbus ' flagship jumbo a380 suffered from production difficulties and concerns about rising fuel costs .
airbus , which is based in toulouse in france , has announced three delays in deliveries for the superjumbo since early 2005 .
earlier this month , thomas enders , head of the european space consortium that runs airbus , acknowledged that 2006 had been an " annus horribilis , " or miserable year , for the company .
airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .

emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .

airbus needed to account for billions of euros in charges due to delays in its production of ordered a380 super jumbos , enders said , as well as a costly miscalculation in its new long-distance jet a350 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ceo thomas enders : 2006 was a very bad year for airbus the latest blow for airbus came on tuesday when the emirates airline confirmed that it was seeking financial compensation from airbus , saying it had been " badly hurt " by the two-year delay in delivery for the superjumbo a380 plane .
emirates is the world 's biggest customer for the a380 , having ordered 45 of the 555-seat , double-deck aircraft in a deal worth about $ 13.5 billion . nevertheless , a spokeswoman for airbus told news agencies last week that 2006 was " the second-best year in the history of the company " in terms of orders and deliveries , despite its having dropped in the rankings against boeing .
the company will publish detailed results jan .
17 .
the last time boeing sold more planes than airbus was in 2000 .
but even in 2005 , airbus only had a narrow lead in orders , booking 1055 compared with boeing 's 1002 .
key indicator new orders are considered the most important early indicator for the companies .
boeing 's lead is based foremost on orders for expensive and profit-making wide-body aircraft .
in terms of smaller models , with only one central aisle , airbus sold nearly as much as boeing .
the us concern 's long-haul model , the boeing 787 , turned out to be its most successful model of the year in 2006 , with 147 planes sold .
these are slated for delivery in 2008 . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .

dw-world.de spoke to heike rauer , german head of the project . scientists hope to get an insight into the planets of neighboring solar systems when the corot satellite launches on wednesday at 1423 gmt from kazakhstan . a project of the french national space studies center -lrb- cnes -rrb- in which the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is participating , corot will send into orbit a telescope capable of detecting smaller , rocky planets that could support life . the mission is a milestone in the search for a second earth , heike rauer said in an interview with dw-world.de. dw-world : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- has called corot a unique astronomical mission .
what is so special about this project ? heike rauer : for the first time , the corot satellite will look from space for planets that do n't orbit our sun , but instead circle other stars in other solar systems .
we hope , with corot , to find rocky planets close to a star .
until now , these planets have not been found , but we believe they exist .
the research will hopefully discover a second earth . can corot find planets that are similar to earth ? corot finds planets by measuring changes in brightness .
it observes a star from a certain point and if a planet passes within its orbit between the star and the satellite , the brightness changes and corot measures that .
one can think of it as similar to a lunar eclipse .
since corot will only spend five months looking at a certain area , it is unlikely that it will see another earth .
an earth-like planet would need an entire year to orbit around the star and then would come only one time in the year past the point that the satellite is watching .
we will not likely find a second earth , but rather other planets , that are closer to the stars , where the orbiting period is shorter . could people live on these planets ? if the star these planets orbit around is as hot as our sun , it would be uninhabitable for humans , because the temperatures on the planet would be so high .
but there are also so-called m stars , which are not as hot .
the planets that orbit around these stars are much cooler and could support life .
when corot finds such planets , it would naturally be extremely exciting .
corot can not recognize whether there 's life on these planets or whether life would be possible there .
to find this out , one must examine the atmosphere and look for molecules such as water , ozone or oxygen . can corot 's findings be trusted or does it only provide a basis for information ? corot measures the changes in the brightness of stars , which could have a variety of causes .
naturally , we hope that a change in brightness is produced by a planet .
it could be that the star has spots or that it 's not a star and a planet , but rather two stars crossing each other .
to start out , the scientists must figure out what caused the crop in brightness .
one can not hope that corot will immediately begin discovering terrestrial planets .
the scientists will only announce they 've found a planet if they 're sure . interview by christine elsaeßer -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : stereo satellites give new view of solar explosions scientists hope a pair of satellites recently sent into space will help them understand solar explosions of electrified gas and particles that cause the northern lights and can disrupt power grids on earth .

a hugely experienced congressman , he became president richard nixon 's vice-president in 1973 , when spiro agnew resigned amid corruption charges ten months later , nixon himself stood down over the watergate scandal , and on 9 august 1974 , ford became the 38th president .
it was a difficult period for him to take over , in the aftermath of the watergate scandal and with the country in a severe recession .
when he left office two and a half years later , after a narrow election defeat , he said he was proud to be handing over the country to president carter in better shape than he had found it .
the new president , in turn , thanked him for all he had done to heal the wounds of watergate .
gerald rudolph ford was born in omaha , nebraska .
his name then was leslie lynch king jr , but his parents divorced when he was a toddler , and his mother married a gerald ford .
the boy took his name .
he grew up in grand rapids , michigan , and became something of a football hero , playing centre in the university of michigan 's undefeated national teams of 1932 and 1933 .
he turned down a number of professional contracts , deciding instead to go to yale law school , where he helped to pay his way by coaching fellow students in boxing and football .
ford was adopted as the republican candidate for a safe seat in southern michigan , and was elected to congress in 1948 .
the same year he married elizabeth ann bloomer , a former model and a divorcee , later to become famous in her own right as a reformed alcoholic and founder of the betty ford center , which helped pioneer the treatment of drink and drug addiction .
possibility of power in 1965 gerald ford was elected republican leader in the house .
he was a member of the warren commission which investigated the assassination of president kennedy - concluding that lee harvey oswald had acted alone - and co-author of a book , portrait of an assassin .
outside congress , ford was little known but , in 1973 , spiro agnew resigned .
president nixon , an old friend , nominated ford as vice-president .
he was then 60 and had been in congress for a quarter of a century .
with president nixon 's own position in growing danger , there was soon speculation about the possibility of ford succeeding him .
after nixon 's admission of guilt early in august 1974 , ford announced he intended to bow out of the impeachment " debate " , while standing by his belief that president nixon was innocent .
pardon for nixon on 9 august , nixon resigned and ford was sworn in as president .
his first address to the two houses of congress was something of a triumph for him and he made an excellent impression at a televised news conference .
but the honeymoon came to an abrupt end when , a month to the day after he had taken office , he granted nixon a full pardon for all offences against the united states which he might have committed while in office .
this provoked a political and moral storm , and the ruling was bitterly opposed in many quarters , but the president appeared unmoved .
shortly afterwards , he offered an amnesty to thousands of young americans who had either evaded conscription or deserted during the vietnam war .
the republicans had a severe setback in the mid-term elections in november 1974 and the president , in his efforts to overcome inflation , unemployment and a serious energy shortage , had to deal with a congress in which many of his proposals were stalled by the democrats .
struggles with congress before long , however , it became clear that despite his problems , the man who once admitted " i 'm a ford , not a lincoln " enjoyed being president and intended to seek the republican nomination in the 1976 election .
in foreign policy , ford and his secretary of state , dr henry kissinger , continued the nixon policies of detente with the soviet union and a search for a middle east settlement .
ford went to the soviet union , south korea and japan , becoming the first us president to visit tokyo .
he returned to a worsening economic situation and a continuing running fight with congress .
during his first year in office he had to use his veto 36 times .
in september , there were two attempts on the president 's life , one in sacramento , the other in san francisco .
after a neck-and-neck race with ronald reagan , ford narrowly won the party presidential nomination in 1976 .
the contest against the democratic party nominee , jimmy carter , turned out to be surprisingly dull .
ford , representing continuity and safety , started well behind in the public opinion polls but caught up steadily .
narrow defeat in one of his three television appearances with carter , he made a slip of the tongue by asserting that eastern europe was independent of soviet domination , and brought a good deal of ridicule upon himself .
in the end , carter won narrowly , by 1.8 million votes , courtesy of a twin-track approach which saw him portrayed as a favourite son in the south and as a champion of marginalised voters , most notably farmers and christians , in the north .
ford , in his farewell state of the union report to congress , spoke of his pride that america was at peace and warned the nation to keep up its defences in the face of a steady build-up of soviet military forces .
out of office , gerald ford remained an active , if marginal , political voice .
in 1980 , he came within an ace of being nominated as ronald reagan 's vice-presidential running mate , before his demand for wider powers and responsibilities ruled him out .
despite his republican beliefs , he championed affirmative action , arguing that it was consistent with " the notion of america as a work in progress " .
and his belief in the importance of research into therapeutic cloning , a pro-choice stance on reproductive rights and his endorsement of civil unions for gay people , placed ford at odds with much of his party .
in 1999 , bill clinton presented ford with the presidential medal of freedom , one of the us 's highest awards .
more recently health problems , including a series of strokes , had limited his public appearances .
gerald ford 's reputation was always that of a decent , friendly man , calm , patient and fair-minded , although somewhat lacking in flair and imagination .
a self-confessed " man of the house , " he kept a keen eye on the workings of congress , even after leaving the oval office .
above all , he showed consistent dedication in endeavouring to fulfil his pledge that he would do his best for america .

vista will be the big event in computer security in 2007 , say experts and add that it will have a profound effect on both sides of the security world .
many organised crime gangs are already tearing the new version of windows apart looking for ways to exploit its weaknesses , say some .
others are expecting to see vista attacked soon after it debuts .
fresh target while microsoft 's business customers have been able to buy vista since 30 november , consumers are being forced to wait until late january 2007 to get their hands on the next version of the windows operating system .
microsoft has said that the whole development process of the operating system has been run with better security in mind .
within vista are several technologies that could stop many people falling victim to the most common sorts of malicious attack , said kevin hogan , director of security operations at symantec .
in particular , he said , the way vista handles user accounts will limit the freedom malicious programs have to run and install themselves surreptitiously .
increasingly , said mr hogan , hi-tech criminals were booby-trapping benign looking webpages with code that slips through vulnerabilities in the various versions of windows .
it should also help stop people being caught out by malicious attachments on e-mail messages .
" that 'll deal with a lot of the current threats we are seeing , " said mr hogan .
mikko hypponen , chief research officer at security firm f-secure , said the warnings that these account controls display when malicious code tries to install itself will prove useful .
" it 'll become much more obvious when they get infected , " he said .
but , said mr hypponen , as well as stopping some of the threats hitting users , vista is also likely to spur many hi-tech criminals to step up their research efforts and translate their old malicious wares to the new software .
" none of the existing bots , backdoors , trojans in general run on vista , " said mr hypponen .
already security experts are seeing exploits for vista vulnerabilities being sold on underground websites and proof-of-concept code appearing on discussion boards .
gerhard eschelbeck , chief technology officer at security firm webroot , said he expected the hi-tech criminals to start exploiting the many ways that vista tries to warn people about security threats .
he said it was only a matter of time before cyber criminals find a way to mimic the security warnings that vista uses to try to trick people into installing a malicious program .
" they are thinking how to attack the user directly rather than try to penetrate the applications , " he said .
old iron while vista might help many users stay safer online , many criminals would be happy targeting the tens of millions of people who own older versions of windows , said mr eschelbeck .
in 2007 he said he expected to see malicious code turning up on many different types of sites - many of which looked completely benign .
those behind malicious programs were also more interested in having their creations hang around longer , said mr eschelbeck .
" the goal is to stay undetected for a long time , " he said .
" it 's being driven by people looking for financial gain . "
the diversity of the hi-tech underground was also shown by the new targets many were going after , said paul davie , chief executive of security firm secerno .
he said many hi-tech criminals were now targeting web shops that use a database to handle orders in a bid to steal valuable information they can sell or use .
many attackers , he said , were using sophisticated techniques to squeeze information out of databases .
" these attacks - examples of which include hackers exposing hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers worldwide - certainly will increase sharply in 2007 , " he said .
" the security sector is coming to terms with the fact that it is dealing with highly financially motivated , technologically advanced and professional database infiltrators , " he said .

vista will be the big event in computer security in 2007 , say experts and add that it will have a profound effect on both sides of the security world .
many organised crime gangs are already tearing the new version of windows apart looking for ways to exploit its weaknesses , say some .
others are expecting to see vista attacked soon after it debuts .
fresh target while microsoft 's business customers have been able to buy vista since 30 november , consumers are being forced to wait until late january 2007 to get their hands on the next version of the windows operating system .
microsoft has said that the whole development process of the operating system has been run with better security in mind .
within vista are several technologies that could stop many people falling victim to the most common sorts of malicious attack , said kevin hogan , director of security operations at symantec .
in particular , he said , the way vista handles user accounts will limit the freedom malicious programs have to run and install themselves surreptitiously .
increasingly , said mr hogan , hi-tech criminals were booby-trapping benign looking webpages with code that slips through vulnerabilities in the various versions of windows .
it should also help stop people being caught out by malicious attachments on e-mail messages .
" that 'll deal with a lot of the current threats we are seeing , " said mr hogan .
hypponen : cyber criminals are translating their wares to work on vista mikko hypponen , chief research officer at security firm f-secure , said the warnings that these account controls display when malicious code tries to install itself will prove useful .
" it 'll become much more obvious when they get infected , " he said .
but , said mr hypponen , as well as stopping some of the threats hitting users , vista is also likely to spur many hi-tech criminals to step up their research efforts and translate their old malicious wares to the new software .
" none of the existing bots , backdoors , trojans in general run on vista , " said mr hypponen .
already security experts are seeing exploits for vista vulnerabilities being sold on underground websites and proof-of-concept code appearing on discussion boards .
gerhard eschelbeck , chief technology officer at security firm webroot , said he expected the hi-tech criminals to start exploiting the many ways that vista tries to warn people about security threats .
he said it was only a matter of time before cyber criminals find a way to mimic the security warnings that vista uses to try to trick people into installing a malicious program .
" they are thinking how to attack the user directly rather than try to penetrate the applications , " he said .
old iron while vista might help many users stay safer online , many criminals would be happy targeting the tens of millions of people who own older versions of windows , said mr eschelbeck .
hi-tech criminals are targeting web-based databases in 2007 he said he expected to see malicious code turning up on many different types of sites - many of which looked completely benign .
those behind malicious programs were also more interested in having their creations hang around longer , said mr eschelbeck .
" the goal is to stay undetected for a long time , " he said .
" it 's being driven by people looking for financial gain . "
the diversity of the hi-tech underground was also shown by the new targets many were going after , said paul davie , chief executive of security firm secerno .
he said many hi-tech criminals were now targeting web shops that use a database to handle orders in a bid to steal valuable information they can sell or use .
many attackers , he said , were using sophisticated techniques to squeeze information out of databases .
" these attacks - examples of which include hackers exposing hundreds of thousands of credit card numbers worldwide - certainly will increase sharply in 2007 , " he said .

vista will be the big event in computer security in 2007 , say experts and add that it will have a profound effect on both sides of the security world .
many organised crime gangs are already tearing the new version of windows apart looking for ways to exploit its weaknesses , say some .
others are expecting to see vista attacked soon after it debuts .
fresh target while microsoft 's business customers have been able to buy vista since 30 november , consumers are being forced to wait until late january 2007 to get their hands on the next version of the windows operating system .
microsoft has said that the whole development process of the operating system has been run with better security in mind .
within vista are several technologies that could stop many people falling victim to the most common sorts of malicious attack , said kevin hogan , director of security operations at symantec .
in particular , he said , the way vista handles user accounts will limit the freedom malicious programs have to run and install themselves surreptitiously .
increasingly , said mr hogan , hi-tech criminals were booby-trapping benign looking webpages with code that slips through vulnerabilities in the various versions of windows .
it should also help stop people being caught out by malicious attachments on e-mail messages .
" that 'll deal with a lot of the current threats we are seeing , " said mr hogan .

" it 'll become much more obvious when they get infected , " he said .
but , said mr hypponen , as well as stopping some of the threats hitting users , vista is also likely to spur many hi-tech criminals to step up their research efforts and translate their old malicious wares to the new software .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said " too many " pupils left primary school unable to read and write and do mathematics well .
it said regular teacher assessments of pupils ' work should replace the testing of pupils aged 11 and 14 .
the report was endorsed by the general teaching council for england -lrb- gtc -rrb- .
the ippr report criticised what it called the negative effects of the current testing regime , which included narrow learning , shallow learning , question spotting and risk-averse teaching .
it said the testing system encouraged " teaching to the test " rather than providing skills for secondary school .
the ippr suggested pupils should be assessed throughout each key stage by teachers - as they are at age seven in england and in primary schools in wales .
it said a progress-related target would mean that secondary schools would have to focus on the needs of each pupil , even where average attainment in the school was good .
it proposed that all pupils should be expected to make at least one level of progress between the end of key stages 2 and 3 - roughly ages 11 and 14 .
respecting teachers ippr associate director richard brooks said parents should get information about how their child is doing from teacher assessment , while sample tests scores of schools would give parents and the authorities an idea of how schools were performing .
the gtc wants to see a reduction in the overload of testing general teaching council for england " we should have a system where it is simply not possible to teach to the test , " said mr brooks .
tests were making it " very difficult " to deliver the kind of teaching that was " sensitive to individual pupils " , he added .
in a statement , the general teaching council for england said : " we welcome the ippr 's report on assessment - it supports our view that the current regime encourages " teaching to the test " and that tests are being used for too many conflicting purposes .
" the gtc wants to see a reduction in the overload of testing and is proposing that samples of children are tested at the end of every key stage , to monitor national standards over time .
" we also back the ippr 's call for more trust to be placed in the professional judgement of teachers to use assessment to support pupil learning more effectively . "
institute for public policy research founded in 1988 calls itself the uk 's leading progressive think tank close links with labour party thinking underpinned many policies of the 1997 new labour government current director nick pearce was a special adviser to david blunkett at the home office and education department the department for education and skills said tests were an integral part of effective teaching and learning and were " a non-negotiable part of school reform " .
" they provide valuable objective evidence in the core subjects , helping inform further improvements to teaching and learning , " a spokesman said .
" they are not designed to be ' pass or fail ' examinations and we have stressed that preparation time should be kept to an absolute minimum and that teachers help children prepare best when they teach the core subjects as fully and effectively as possible . "
the department said the qualifications and curriculum authority monitored them to ensure they tested a depth of knowledge that could not simply be instilled by " teaching to the test " .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said " too many " pupils left primary school unable to read and write and do mathematics well .
it said regular teacher assessments of pupils ' work should replace the testing of pupils aged 11 and 14 .
the report was endorsed by the general teaching council for england -lrb- gtc -rrb- .
the ippr report criticised what it called the negative effects of the current testing regime , which included narrow learning , shallow learning , question spotting and risk-averse teaching .
it said the testing system encouraged " teaching to the test " rather than providing skills for secondary school .
the ippr suggested pupils should be assessed throughout each key stage by teachers - as they are at age seven in england and in primary schools in wales .
it said a progress-related target would mean that secondary schools would have to focus on the needs of each pupil , even where average attainment in the school was good .
it proposed that all pupils should be expected to make at least one level of progress between the end of key stages 2 and 3 - roughly ages 11 and 14 .

" the gtc wants to see a reduction in the overload of testing and is proposing that samples of children are tested at the end of every key stage , to monitor national standards over time .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said " too many " pupils left primary school unable to read and write and do mathematics well .
it said regular teacher assessments of pupils ' work should replace the testing of pupils aged 11 and 14 .
the report was endorsed by the general teaching council for england -lrb- gtc -rrb- .
the ippr report criticised what it called the negative effects of the current testing regime , which included narrow learning , shallow learning , question spotting and risk-averse teaching .
it said the testing system encouraged " teaching to the test " rather than providing skills for secondary school .
the ippr suggested pupils should be assessed throughout each key stage by teachers - as they are at age seven in england and in primary schools in wales .
it said a progress-related target would mean that secondary schools would have to focus on the needs of each pupil , even where average attainment in the school was good .
it proposed that all pupils should be expected to make at least one level of progress between the end of key stages 2 and 3 - roughly ages 11 and 14 .
respecting teachers ippr associate director richard brooks said parents should get information about how their child is doing from teacher assessment , while sample tests scores of schools would give parents and the authorities an idea of how schools were performing .
the gtc wants to see a reduction in the overload of testing general teaching council for england " we should have a system where it is simply not possible to teach to the test , " said mr brooks .
tests were making it " very difficult " to deliver the kind of teaching that was " sensitive to individual pupils " , he added .
in a statement , the general teaching council for england said : " we welcome the ippr 's report on assessment - it supports our view that the current regime encourages " teaching to the test " and that tests are being used for too many conflicting purposes .
" the gtc wants to see a reduction in the overload of testing and is proposing that samples of children are tested at the end of every key stage , to monitor national standards over time .
" we also back the ippr 's call for more trust to be placed in the professional judgement of teachers to use assessment to support pupil learning more effectively . "
institute for public policy research founded in 1988 calls itself the uk 's leading progressive think tank close links with labour party thinking underpinned many policies of the 1997 new labour government current director nick pearce was a special adviser to david blunkett at the home office and education department the department for education and skills said tests were an integral part of effective teaching and learning and were " a non-negotiable part of school reform " .
" they provide valuable objective evidence in the core subjects , helping inform further improvements to teaching and learning , " a spokesman said .
" they are not designed to be ' pass or fail ' examinations and we have stressed that preparation time should be kept to an absolute minimum and that teachers help children prepare best when they teach the core subjects as fully and effectively as possible . "
the department said the qualifications and curriculum authority monitored them to ensure they tested a depth of knowledge that could not simply be instilled by " teaching to the test " .
